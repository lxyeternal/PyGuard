{
  "purpose": "The module provides data preprocessing functions for handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and outlier treatment in datasets, primarily for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data 'X' and optional target 'y'; feature lists for categorical and numerical data; parameters for scaling, encoding, and outlier handling.",
  "sinks": "Transformations such as imputation, scaling, encoding, and replacement of outliers; data returned as numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Data is read from 'X' and 'y'; features are selected based on types or provided lists; missing values are imputed; outliers are potentially replaced; features are scaled and encoded; data is transformed into numpy arrays for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The imputation strategies, encoding methods, and scaling are standard practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured and typical of data preprocessing modules.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by converting input 'X' to a DataFrame if it is a numpy array, ensuring compatibility. It then identifies categorical and numerical features either from provided lists or via data types. Missing values are handled using 'SimpleImputer' with standard strategies. Outliers in numerical features are optionally handled via z-score detection and replacement with the mean. Scaling is performed with standard, min-max, or robust methods as specified. Categorical features are encoded via one-hot or label encoding. The target 'y' is also encoded if needed. Finally, data is converted back to numpy arrays for output. All operations utilize standard scikit-learn methods with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data preprocessing utility with no malicious intent. It employs standard libraries and methods for data cleaning and transformation, with no signs of malicious code or sabotage. The code appears safe and suitable for use in data pipelines.",
