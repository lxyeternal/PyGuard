{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for data preprocessing and manipulation, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and managing outliers.",
  "sources": "Input data (X and y) provided as function arguments, reading feature types via pandas select_dtypes, and internal variables for scalers and encoders.",
  "sinks": "Transformations on X and y, including imputations, scaling, encoding, and outlier correction, which modify data in-place or return processed data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into preprocessing steps such as missing value imputation, outlier handling, scaling, and encoding, then transformed data flows into final output as numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data transmissions. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. Uses standard sklearn preprocessing methods and pandas operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data preprocessing tasks using established libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn). It converts input arrays to DataFrames for processing, identifies feature types, handles missing data with imputation, optionally detects and replaces outliers with mean, scales features with standard, minmax, or robust scalers, and encodes categorical features via one-hot or label encoding. The target variable y is also optionally encoded if specified. All transformations are standard, well-understood data science operations with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no network connections, data exfiltration mechanisms, or system modifications. The code strictly operates within the scope of data preprocessing and does not contain hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data preprocessing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies solely on established libraries to perform data transformations and includes no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
