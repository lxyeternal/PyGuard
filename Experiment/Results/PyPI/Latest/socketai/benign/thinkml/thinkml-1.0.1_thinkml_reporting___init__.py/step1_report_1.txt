  "purpose": "Provides reporting tools for machine learning experiment summaries, including data, preprocessing, and evaluation reports.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .report_generator import generate_report",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no network or file operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports and defines metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements; straightforward module definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, defines a version, and exports the generate_report function. There are no data input/output operations, no network connections, and no hidden or malicious logic. It appears to be a standard module setup for a reporting utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply exposes a reporting function for external use.",
