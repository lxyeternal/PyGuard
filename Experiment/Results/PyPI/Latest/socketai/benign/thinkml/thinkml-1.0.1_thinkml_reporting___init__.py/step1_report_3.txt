{
  "purpose": "The code provides reporting functionality for machine learning experiments, including data summaries, preprocessing steps, and model evaluation results.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .report_generator import generate_report",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential use of generate_report function may involve file I/O or data handling, but not shown here",
  "flows": "Import statement potentially loads code from a local module; no data flows shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures observed; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, sets version info, and defines __all__ for exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup for reporting functionality. No external data inputs, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for reporting in a machine learning context. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
