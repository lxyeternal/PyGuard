{
  "purpose": "This module provides reporting tools for machine learning experiments, including generating reports and summarizing data, preprocessing, and evaluation results.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing generate_report from a local module, and versioning/all declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily defines and exposes functions and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The import relies on a local module, which appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a module docstring, an import statement, and metadata declarations. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. The imported module 'report_generator' is external to this snippet; its content could potentially carry risk, but based solely on this code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module for reporting in a machine learning context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within the provided snippet.",
