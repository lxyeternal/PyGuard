  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for generating machine learning experiment reports, serving as a wrapper or interface to the report_generator module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.report_generator). No external input sources or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present. No functions or network operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only imports and sets module attributes without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated language features, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a report generation function, sets a version, and specifies exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for reporting functionality, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, straightforward Python module.",
