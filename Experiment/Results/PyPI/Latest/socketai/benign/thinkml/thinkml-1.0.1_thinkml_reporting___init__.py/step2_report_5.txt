  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal module: a Python file that imports a function from a local module, sets version info, and defines `__all__`.\n- No external input, network activity, file I/O, or data processing is present.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or anomalies are noted.\n- The code appears straightforward, serving as a simple interface or wrapper for the `report_generator` module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code is very minimal, and all reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  **None.** The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is a standard module setup.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. No external inputs, network, or file operations are involved.\n\n### Reasonableness of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident, the risk scores are correctly low.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward module with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple interface for report generation, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action required.",
