  "purpose": "Provides an interface for generating machine learning experiment reports by importing a report generator function.",
  "sources": "Import from local module 'report_generator'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Import of 'generate_report' function; no data flow beyond module scope",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a function, sets version info, and exports the function. No external input, data processing, or network activity is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior or obfuscation indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to a safe and straightforward implementation.",
