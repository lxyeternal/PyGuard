  "purpose": "Provides reporting tools for machine learning experiments, including generating reports from the report_generator module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing generate_report from a local module (.report_generator).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or data sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports a function and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. The module appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a reporting function from a local module, sets version and export variables, and contains no malicious behavior. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure is simple and typical for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serves as an interface for reporting functionality, and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
