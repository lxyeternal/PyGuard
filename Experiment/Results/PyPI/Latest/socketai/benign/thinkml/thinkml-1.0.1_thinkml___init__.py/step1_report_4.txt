{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to the ThinkML machine learning library by importing various modules for validation, optimization, feature engineering, interpretability, regression, classification, calibration, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from the 'thinkml' package",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network or file operations are performed",
  "flows": "Imports from 'thinkml' modules; no data flow from untrusted sources or to untrusted sinks is observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; the code appears to be a standard package interface setup",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of import statements and a version declaration, defining the public API with __all__; no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present that could pose security risks. All imports are from the same package, suggesting a well-structured library. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as an API entry point or module initializer, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for the ThinkML library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It imports various components for machine learning tasks without performing any suspicious operations.",
