  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization file (`__init__.py`), primarily importing modules and defining the public API.\n- No data processing, dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- The code is free of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The versioning and export lists are standard for Python packages.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as executing untrusted code, network access, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n\n- Since all reports are consistent and indicate no malicious activity, there is no evidence to suggest any hidden or malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be a standard package setup, exposing modules for a machine learning library.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, there is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet. It is a typical package initialization script with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's straightforward nature.",
