{
  "purpose": "The code provides import statements and module metadata for the ThinkML machine learning library, facilitating access to various components such as validation, optimization, feature engineering, interpretability, regression, classification, calibration, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'thinkml' package, including specific modules and functions, and the __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted or external data; the code primarily imports internal modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and classes for use elsewhere; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The version string and module imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization script that imports various components from the 'thinkml' package and sets the module's version and export list. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a benign library definition setup with no active data processing or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package import and setup script with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues detected. It simply prepares the module for use by importing necessary components.",
