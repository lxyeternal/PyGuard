  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization file (__init__.py style), importing modules and defining __all__ and __version__.\n- No code execution, data handling, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just module imports and metadata setup, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, and the conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n  Correct, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.  \n  Correct, no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Security risk score:** 0.  \n  Correct, no security risks are apparent in this code snippet.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or higher?**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as a benign package setup.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
