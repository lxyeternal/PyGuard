  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'bluetoothcompanion' that facilitates Bluetooth communication.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, codecs, os; variables defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily static configuration and package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for packaging, defines metadata variables, and calls setup() with static values. There are no input reads, environment variable manipulations, or code execution commands. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected. The script appears to be a standard package setup file, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
