  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'bluetoothcompanion'.",
  "sources": "Static variables for package metadata, find_packages() for module discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, conventional, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that defines package metadata with static data and calls setup() accordingly. It does not process user input, environment variables, or perform any dynamic operations. No network activity, obfuscated code, or embedded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and poses no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
