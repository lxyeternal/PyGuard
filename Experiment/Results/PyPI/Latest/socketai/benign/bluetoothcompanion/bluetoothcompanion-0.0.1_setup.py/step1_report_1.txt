  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'bluetoothcompanion' intended to facilitate Bluetooth communication.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as package metadata and uses find_packages() to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script solely defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The code adheres to standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines package metadata, including version, description, author, and classifiers. It uses find_packages() to locate package modules, which is standard. There are no user inputs, external data, or dynamic code execution. No hidden or malicious logic observed. The code appears straightforward and conventional for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to package and distribute the Bluetooth communication module.",
