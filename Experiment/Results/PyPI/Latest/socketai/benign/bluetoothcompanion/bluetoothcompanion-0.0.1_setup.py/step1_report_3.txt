  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bluetoothcompanion' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata variables, find_packages() function to discover packages, import statements for setuptools, codecs, os.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and classifiers. The use of find_packages() is typical for package discovery. No user input handling, no network operations, and no code execution beyond standard setup calls are present. The code appears purely for packaging purposes without any embedded malicious logic or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a conventional setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and safe package configuration.",
