  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'bluetoothcompanion' to facilitate Bluetooth communication.",
  "sources": "Variables defining package metadata (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), import statements for setup and os modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup configuration only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata, and calls the setup() function with static data. There are no sources of untrusted input or sinks that could lead to data leakage or execution of malicious code. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward package setup code intended for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and solely used for packaging purposes.",
