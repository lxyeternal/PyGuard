  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'bluetoothcompanion' for distribution.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code uses static variables and standard setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detected; the code purely defines package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. No user input, environment variable, or runtime data influences behavior. There are no embedded or dynamic code executions, no network operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely to configure package metadata for distribution.",
