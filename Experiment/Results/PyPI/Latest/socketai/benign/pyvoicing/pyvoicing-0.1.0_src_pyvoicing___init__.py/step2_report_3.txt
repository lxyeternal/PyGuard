  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code presence of issues:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports symbols, typical for a package's `__init__.py` or similar module. No external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports consistently identify the code as benign, standard, and without malicious intent. They do not identify any logical flaws or misinterpretations. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n   \n   **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all evidence points to benign code with no external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as a simple import/export module. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the straightforward analysis.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard module that imports specific classes and constants, then exposes them via `__all__`.  \n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves as an API surface for a music-related package. No security concerns or malicious activity are detected.",
