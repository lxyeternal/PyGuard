{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be a package's __init__.py file, intended to organize and export specific classes and constants related to music theory or musical data structures.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads are present in this code; it only performs imports and defines an export list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not process user input, files, or network data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only organizes imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All imports seem to be from local modules, and the __all__ list cleanly exposes classes and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and constants from relative modules, and defines an __all__ list for export. It functions as an index or package initializer, with no data processing, external input, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely organizes exports for other modules in the package.",
