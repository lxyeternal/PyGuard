{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and constants from other modules and defines the public interface for the package via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .chroma, .constants, .interval, .pitch, .rest, .voicing",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports and then exposes certain classes and constants; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The __all__ list simply exposes specific identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs module imports and defines the public API with __all__. It does not process, transform, or handle any external or untrusted input. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behavior is detectable. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module file. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export statement with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It serves as a public interface for a music-related package, with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
