  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely import/export statements, with no data processing, external input handling, or network operations.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - The code serves as a module initializer or API interface, typical for a Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment; no logical flaws or errors are identified.\n   - The code's structure is standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting strong agreement on benignity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is benign, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk scores given the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All claims are based on the static analysis of import/export statements.\n   - No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module that imports and exposes classes/constants for a music-related package. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this module.",
