{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes and constants related to musical concepts such as pitch, interval, chroma, and voicing, and then exports these objects for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local modules: .chroma, .constants, .interval, .pitch, .rest, and .voicing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling is present; the code does not process external input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines imports and an exported list of identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The module only re-exports symbols from other modules.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is straightforward, importing specific classes and constants from sibling modules and defining an __all__ list for module exports. There are no dynamic executions, no data processing, and no signs of malicious activity. The purpose appears to be organizing and exposing musical data structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python module for organizing exports related to musical concepts. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.",
