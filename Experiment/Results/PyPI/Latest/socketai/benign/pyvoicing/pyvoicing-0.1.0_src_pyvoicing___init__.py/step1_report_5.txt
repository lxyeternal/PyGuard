{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports module components related to musical concepts such as chroma, intervals, pitch, rest, and voicing for use in a larger musical processing library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes and constants from internal module files (.chroma, .constants, .interval, .pitch, .rest, .voicing).",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code simply imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements and an __all__ export list. It imports specific classes and constants from internal modules, then defines what symbols are publicly available. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present. The structure is typical for a module defining public API components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export script with no malicious or security concerns identified. It solely organizes and exposes components related to musical concepts, and there are no suspicious or harmful elements.",
