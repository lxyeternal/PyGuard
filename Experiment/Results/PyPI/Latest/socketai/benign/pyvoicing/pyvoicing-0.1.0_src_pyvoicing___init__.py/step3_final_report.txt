{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API surface for a music-related package, importing specific classes and constants and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports symbols from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols internally.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import/export module, likely an __init__.py, exposing classes and constants related to musical concepts. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a package API surface. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security concerns. It functions solely as an API surface for a music-related package, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The existing scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
