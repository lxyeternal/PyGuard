{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports classes and constants related to musical concepts such as pitch, interval, chroma, and voicing, and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (.chroma, .constants, .interval, .pitch, .rest, .voicing), importing specific classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not write data, connect to network, or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; it simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations, are evident. The code is straightforward import/export logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports specific classes and constants from relative modules and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains no input handling, network operations, or data processing. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or API module, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal module initializer for a music-related library, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It simply organizes and exports symbols.",
