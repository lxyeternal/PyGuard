  "purpose": "Static definitions of musical notation mappings including chroma, ABC notation, and interval names.",
  "sources": "None; static dictionary definitions with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static data structures without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `Rest()` objects as dictionary keys and values, which may depend on implementation details of the `Rest` class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static mappings for musical concepts, primarily using dictionaries. The only unconventional aspect is the use of `Rest()` instances as keys and values, which could lead to lookup issues if `Rest()` creates new objects each time. No dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity is present. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are all zero for malware and obfuscation, with minimal risk scores, reflecting the benign nature. The main concern is the potential for inconsistent object identity if `Rest()` is not a singleton, but this does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for musical notation mappings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor technical concern relates to the use of `Rest()` objects as dictionary keys, which could cause functional bugs if not handled carefully, but does not pose a security risk.",
