  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining constant mappings for musical notation.\n- The only anomaly noted is the use of `Rest()` as dictionary keys and values, which is unconventional but not inherently malicious.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code does not perform any I/O, manipulation, or processing that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The use of `Rest()` as dictionary keys and values is unusual because it involves object instances. If `Rest()` creates a new object each time, then multiple dictionaries instantiate `Rest()` separately, leading to different object identities. If `Rest()` is implemented as a singleton or a class with a singleton pattern, then object identity remains consistent, and this is safe.\n\n**Potential concern:**  \n- If `Rest()` creates new instances each time, then using these objects as dictionary keys could cause lookup failures or inconsistencies. However, this is a code correctness concern, not a security issue.\n\n**Security implications:**  \n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, malware, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0` or `0.1`. Given the absence of any security issues, this is reasonable.\n\n**Note:** The only minor concern is the unconventional use of class instances as dictionary keys, which could cause functional bugs but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the risk score slightly upward** if the use of object instances as dictionary keys is not standard practice, as it could lead to subtle bugs. However, this is more about code correctness than security.\n- **The malware score remains at 0**; no change needed.\n- **Obfuscated score remains at 0**; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minor concern about object identity in dictionary keys, but not security-related)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a benign static configuration module for musical notation, with no security issues. The only technical note is the use of `Rest()` objects as dictionary keys, which should be reviewed for correctness but does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to unconventional use of class instances as keys, but not a security concern)",
