{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for musical pitch, interval, and notation representations using dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it initializes constant mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or execute data flows; it solely sets up static mappings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only creates static dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Rest() within dictionary keys may be considered unusual, but it appears to be a class instantiation for representing rests, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and a local Rest class, then defines multiple dictionaries for musical notation mappings. All dictionaries map integers or strings to strings or Rest objects without involving external data or dynamic execution. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose seems solely to create static lookup tables. There are no embedded malicious code patterns, such as network operations, file access, or obfuscated code. The use of the Rest() class as dictionary values is standard for representing special musical symbols, and no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup of static data mappings related to musical notation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of Rest() within the dictionaries is consistent with representing a rest in music notation. Overall, this code fragment is safe and non-malicious.",
