  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for musical notation mappings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor technical concern relates to the use of `Rest()` objects as dictionary keys, which could cause functional bugs if not handled carefully, but does not pose a security risk."
