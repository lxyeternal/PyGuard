  "purpose": "Define mappings for musical pitch, interval, and notation conversions used in music processing.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries mapping integers and strings to musical concepts, and importing a class Rest from another module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; only static data definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static mappings only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Rest() in dictionaries instead of a simple value; no other unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static dictionary definitions mapping musical concepts like pitch offsets, interval offsets, and notation symbols. It imports a class Rest, which is used as a value in dictionaries, potentially for representing rests in music notation. There are no functions, no dynamic execution, no external data inputs, and no suspicious code behaviors. The dictionaries serve as look-up tables without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No hidden backdoors, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module for a music-related application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for musical mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of Rest() in dictionaries is appropriate for representing musical rests and does not constitute malicious activity.",
