{
  "purpose": "Define mappings for musical pitch, interval, and notation conversions using constants and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "None; all data are static dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or output dynamically.",
  "flows": "None; static mappings are used without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of class instance 'Rest()' in dictionary keys; no malicious behavior but unusual use of class instances in constants.",
  "analysis": "The code declares several dictionaries mapping musical concepts, with the notable inclusion of Rest() instances as dictionary keys for 'rest' and 'z'. The dictionaries are static and contain no dynamic code execution, external input, or secret handling. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, code execution, or data leaks. The only atypical aspect is the use of class instances as dictionary keys, which is unusual but not malicious or harmful. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of static mappings related to music notation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The use of class instances as dictionary keys is unconventional but not harmful or suspicious.",
