{
  "purpose": "Defines a Pitch class for musical pitch representation and manipulation, including conversions, comparisons, transpositions, and ABC notation handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.chroma, .constants, .interval); uses class attributes and properties; no external or user input reading functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no code writes untrusted data or performs network/database actions.",
  "flows": "No external data sources, no data flows from input to output, primarily local computations and property modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code employs match-case statements, which are standard syntax, and manages data safely. No external command execution or dynamic code evaluation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for musical pitches with methods for creation, comparison, transposition, and notation conversion. It uses standard libraries and internal data structures for musical concepts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. All imported modules are internal and related to musical data handling. The class methods manipulate data within expected boundaries, with no network or file operations. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a musical pitch class with no malicious or security-threatening features. It handles data safely and adheres to standard coding practices without suspicious behavior.",
