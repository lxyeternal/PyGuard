{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Pitch class for representing and manipulating musical pitches, including conversion, transposition, comparison, and notation handling.",
  "sources": "Internal parameters, constants, and modules (.chroma, .constants, .interval); no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows through method parameters and property setters/getters within the class; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of a musical pitch class. It operates solely on internal data, with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The code does not contain malicious patterns or obfuscation. The import dependencies are internal modules, likely part of a larger music library, not external or untrusted sources. The parsing routines for ABC notation are standard and do not pose security risks. Overall, the code is benign and safe from supply chain security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a musical pitch class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
