{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'Pitch' for representing and manipulating musical pitches, including conversions, transpositions, and notation handling.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or untrusted data; the class primarily manipulates internal data and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods process data internally; there are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for musical pitch representation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Python class implementing musical pitch logic. It uses pattern matching, properties, and methods to handle pitch data, transpositions, and notation conversions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data handling, or security risks. The use of imports from local modules suggests it is part of a larger project, but these do not introduce security concerns by themselves. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard musical pitch handling class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or suspicious patterns. It is safe for use and contains no apparent security concerns.",
