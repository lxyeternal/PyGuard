  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a musical pitch class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's content."
