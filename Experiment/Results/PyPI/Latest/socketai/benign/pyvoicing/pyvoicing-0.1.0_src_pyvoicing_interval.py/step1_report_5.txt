{
  "purpose": "Define an Interval class for musical intervals, supporting various input types and properties.",
  "sources": "Imports from .constants, TYPE_CHECKING, and .chroma modules, especially the Chroma class and constants INTERVAL_OF, OFFSET_OF.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows through class initialization, property setters/getters, and comparison/operator methods, primarily manipulating numeric interval values.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a dynamic import within the __init__ method to avoid circular dependencies. The use of match-case is modern and clear; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class provides musical interval computations with multiple input types (int, str, other Interval or Chroma). It uses constants for interval names and offsets, with typical property and operator implementations. No indications of malicious activity or malicious data handling, nor external network interactions. The internal import to avoid circular dependencies is a common pattern in Python modules. No code injection, data leakage, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard musical interval utility class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions to model musical intervals, with safe code practices observed. No security concerns or malware detected.",
