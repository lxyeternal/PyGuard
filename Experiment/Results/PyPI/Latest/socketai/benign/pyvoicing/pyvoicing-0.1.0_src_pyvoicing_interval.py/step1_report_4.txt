{
  "purpose": "Define a class for musical intervals with various properties and methods to manipulate and compare them.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method, class attributes, imported constants, and type hints.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not write to files, network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (value, octave) flows into the constructor and property setters; internal calculations update self.distance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling. The code primarily performs arithmetic and data mapping.",
  "analysis": "The class constructs musical interval objects with safe arithmetic operations, string representations, and property management. It imports constants for interval mappings but does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The use of 'match' statement is standard for pattern matching. No data leaks, injections, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a straightforward musical utility class with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, purpose-driven implementation for musical intervals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
