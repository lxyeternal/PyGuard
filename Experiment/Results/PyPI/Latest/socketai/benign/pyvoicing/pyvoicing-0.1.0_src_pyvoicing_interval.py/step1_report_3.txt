  "purpose": "Define an Interval class for musical interval calculations, including properties and operations for offsets, octaves, and interval names.",
  "sources": "Initialization input 'value' parameter, accessors, and methods manipulating 'self.distance'.",
  "sinks": "None directly appear to handle untrusted external input in a vulnerable way; no network, file, or external system access is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows through constructor, affecting 'self.distance'; property setters modify 'self.distance'; operator methods perform arithmetic on 'self.distance'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'match' statement with pattern matching, but no suspicious or obfuscated code; the import of 'Chroma' within the constructor appears safe, although it avoids circular imports. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'Interval' class for music theory calculations, utilizing Python's structural pattern matching for flexible initialization. It references external constants 'INTERVAL_OF' and 'OFFSET_OF' for mapping interval names and offsets. The class provides properties for 'offset' and 'octave' that modify 'self.distance'. The operator overloading methods allow arithmetic and comparison operations based on 'distance'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The use of 'match' pattern is standard and safe in this context. No suspicious anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, well-structured musical interval class with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It mainly performs data encapsulation and arithmetic operations related to music intervals.",
