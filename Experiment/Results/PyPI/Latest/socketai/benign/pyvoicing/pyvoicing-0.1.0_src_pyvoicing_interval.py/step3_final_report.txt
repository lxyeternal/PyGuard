{
  "purpose": "Defines a musical Interval class supporting multiple input types, with properties and operators for musical interval calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__, pattern matching on 'value', referencing constants INTERVAL_OF and OFFSET_OF",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; no network or file I/O present",
  "flows": "Input data flows through pattern matching to set 'self.distance'; properties and operators operate on 'self.distance' internally",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of 'Chroma' within __init__ to avoid circular dependencies; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a musical interval utility class, using standard pattern matching, properties, and arithmetic operators. It handles multiple input types safely, references constants for musical theory, and avoids external system interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic import pattern is common and not suspicious. The code's logic is domain-specific and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility class for musical intervals with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, consistent with the analysis.",
