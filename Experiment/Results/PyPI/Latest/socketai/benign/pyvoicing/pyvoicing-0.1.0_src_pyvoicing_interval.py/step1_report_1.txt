{
  "purpose": "Define an Interval class for musical intervals, allowing creation, comparison, and manipulation of intervals with support for various input types.",
  "sources": "Imports constants from .constants, and types from .chroma if needed; no user input or external data sources are used directly within this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code converts input values to internal distance representation, allowing comparisons and adjustments of interval properties internally; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code uses match-case syntax for pattern matching, which is standard in recent Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class for musical interval calculations, including various property getters and setters, comparison operators, and string representations. It imports constants and conditionally imports a class from another module. The class methods perform arithmetic and comparisons based on internal distance representation. No user input, network activity, or external data manipulation is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward domain-specific implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a well-structured, domain-specific class implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain hidden backdoors. The code is safe based on current analysis.",
