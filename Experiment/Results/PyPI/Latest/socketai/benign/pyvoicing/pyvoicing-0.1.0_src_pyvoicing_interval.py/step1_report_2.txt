{
  "purpose": "This code defines an 'Interval' class used for musical interval calculations, including properties, comparison, and arithmetic operations related to musical intervals.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants from '.constants' (INTERVAL_OF, OFFSET_OF), and imports from '.chroma' module when instantiating Interval objects.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (value parameter) flows from the constructor to internal properties via pattern matching; comparisons and arithmetic operations involve internal 'distance' property. No external data flows into or out of the system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'match' statement for pattern matching is normal; the code avoids circular imports; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a musical interval class with properties and operators. It imports constants and other classes, performs pattern matching on constructor input, and provides typical methods for comparison, string representation, and arithmetic. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate utility class for musical computations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a musical 'Interval' class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe based on the provided code.",
