{
  "purpose": "Defines a Chroma class representing musical pitch classes, including methods for transposition and comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports constants from .constants, data from .interval, and optionally from .pitch for type checking and operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Uses input values for constructing Chroma objects, for example in the constructor, arithmetic operations, and comparisons; these inputs are internally processed but not transmitted or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of __future__ import, type hints, and conditional imports are standard practices in Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a musical 'Chroma' class with methods for transposing and comparing pitch classes. It uses standard Python features, including match-case syntax and conditional imports to avoid circular dependencies. All operations are mathematical or represent string representations and comparisons of pitch classes. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious external interactions are present. No obfuscated or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a typical music theory utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured musical utility class with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only performs internal calculations and representations relevant to pitch classes. No security concerns identified.",
