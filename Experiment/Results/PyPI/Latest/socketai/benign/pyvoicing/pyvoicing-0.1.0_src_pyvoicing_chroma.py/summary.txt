  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for musical pitch class representation. It contains no malicious or security-compromising features. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the minimal security concern, primarily due to standard practices like dynamic imports, which are not malicious."
