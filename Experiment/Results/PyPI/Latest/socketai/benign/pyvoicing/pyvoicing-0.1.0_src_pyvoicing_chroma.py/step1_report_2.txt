{
  "purpose": "Defines the Chroma class for representing pitch classes (chromas) without octave info, with methods for transposition and comparison.",
  "sources": "Input values during object creation (__init__), method arguments for transposition (__mul__, __add__, __truediv__, etc.), comparisons (__eq__), and filtering (__rsub__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or security effects. No network or file I/O operations, no code execution from input.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through constructor (__init__) and transposition methods, but these are used for data manipulation, not untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within methods to avoid circular dependencies; no malicious or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a music theory library.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for musical pitch classes with methods for transposition and comparison. It uses standard Python features such as match-case statements, type annotations, and dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. All operations are within the scope of data manipulation related to musical concepts. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, non-malicious implementation of a musical concept class with no indications of malware or security risks. It performs expected data transformations safely without external side effects.",
