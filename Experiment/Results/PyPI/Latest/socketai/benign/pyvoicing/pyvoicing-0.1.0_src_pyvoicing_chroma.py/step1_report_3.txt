{
  "purpose": "Defines a Chroma class representing musical pitch classes and supports operations like transposition and comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports from .constants, .interval, .pitch modules; usage of class attributes; input parameter values.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that lead to data leaks or external system effects. No network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input values (int, str, Chroma, Pitch) are processed to set offsets; operations like addition/subtraction create new Chroma instances; comparison checks equality.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of dynamic imports appears to be a standard pattern for avoiding circular dependencies, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a musical concept (Chroma) with various operator overloads for transposition and comparison. It uses dynamic importing within methods to avoid circular dependencies. No code injection, network access, or file system manipulation is present. No obfuscation, malicious data leaks, or privacy violations are evident. The code appears to be a well-structured, domain-specific utility class with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of musical pitch class operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard data processing without external side effects or data leakage mechanisms.",
