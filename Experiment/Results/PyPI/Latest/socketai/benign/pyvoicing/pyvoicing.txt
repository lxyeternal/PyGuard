      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured musical data class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2) due to potential misuse of input handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for musical pitch class representation. It contains no malicious or security-compromising features. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the minimal security concern, primarily due to standard practices like dynamic imports, which are not malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for musical notation mappings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor technical concern relates to the use of `Rest()` objects as dictionary keys, which could cause functional bugs if not handled carefully, but does not pose a security risk."
