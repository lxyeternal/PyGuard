  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configurable AI agent framework with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary security concern is the handling of external commands and URIs without validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) reflects these considerations."
