  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, anomalies, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, external data fetches, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable usage, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment) to sinks (network, files), potentially via suspicious or malicious code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, unusual network connections, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, suspicious variable names, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent or minimal in all provided reports, limiting analysis. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of suspicious code. Confidence scores are low where no code exists, appropriately reflecting uncertainty. Risk scores are minimal, with slight variations; in absence of code, they should ideally be zero. Descriptions of typical data processing or network activity without concrete code do not justify higher risk scores. Overall, the assessments are cautious and consistent with the evidence (or lack thereof).",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or insufficient information, assigning low or zero malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are appropriately low, with minor overestimations in some cases. Confidence levels are suitable given the limited data. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the scores accurately reflect the current evidence. No further action is necessary unless actual code is provided for detailed review.",
