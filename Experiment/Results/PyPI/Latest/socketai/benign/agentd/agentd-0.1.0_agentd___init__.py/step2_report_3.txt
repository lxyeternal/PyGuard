  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report, verify the consistency of scores, and assess the validity of their conclusions.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Content**: No code provided.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly notes the absence of code, hence no analysis possible.  \n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate given no code.  \n- **Verdict**: The assessment is reasonable. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Content**: No code, only a general description.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly states insufficient info for detailed review.  \n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — the risk score is slightly above zero despite no code.  \n- **Justification**: Since no code is provided, a risk score of 0.2 may be slightly high; it might be more appropriate to set it to 0, unless there's an explicit concern about the described purpose.  \n- **Verdict**: The low confidence (0.4) and absence of code justify a risk score of 0. Consider lowering it to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Content**: No code, only a general statement.  \n- **Analysis**: Appropriately states inability to analyze without code.  \n- **Scores**: all zero — consistent.  \n- **Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Content**: No code, only descriptions.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly notes the lack of code prevents detailed analysis.  \n- **Scores**: all zero — appropriate.  \n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Content**: No code, only descriptions of potential data flows.  \n- **Analysis**: Correctly states no malicious behavior can be confirmed without code.  \n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — again, a slightly elevated risk score without code.  \n- **Justification**: Given the absence of code, a risk score of 0 would be more justified unless the described purpose inherently suggests risk.  \n- **Verdict**: Slightly inconsistent; consider lowering the risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- **Code presence**: All reports lack actual code snippets, limiting analysis.\n- **Risk scores**: Several reports assign a small but non-zero risk score despite no code being available. This is inconsistent; risk should be based on concrete evidence, not assumptions.\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores**: Correctly zero across all reports due to lack of evidence.\n- **Confidence levels**: Generally low, which is appropriate given the missing code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- For reports with no code, **risk scores should be zero** unless there is explicit, concrete reason to suspect risk.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n- The overall assessments are cautious and appropriate given the limited information.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 to 0.2 for reports with descriptions, but ideally 0 for reports with no code or context.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nAll reports correctly identify the lack of code and appropriately refrain from assigning high risk or malware scores. Slight adjustments could be made to risk scores in reports without code, setting them to zero for consistency.",
