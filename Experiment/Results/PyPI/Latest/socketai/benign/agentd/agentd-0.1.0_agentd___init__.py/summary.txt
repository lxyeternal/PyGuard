  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or insufficient information, assigning low or zero malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are appropriately low, with minor overestimations in some cases. Confidence levels are suitable given the limited data. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the scores accurately reflect the current evidence. No further action is necessary unless actual code is provided for detailed review."
