  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function that requires input processing and data handling, potentially related to user interaction or data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or data received over network connections.",
  "sinks": "Output functions, system commands, or data written to files or network destinations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., output, file writing), possibly passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, obscure or confusing code constructs, use of eval or exec, dynamic code execution, suspicious domain names, or unnecessary obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including initial import statements, core logic, and concluding sections. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity was found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No evidence of malicious data exfiltration or harmful system modifications was detected. Some dynamic evaluation functions (like eval) are used, which can be risky but are not inherently malicious in this context. No obfuscated or deliberately confusing code was identified. Overall, the code appears straightforward and aligns with legitimate functionality, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve its intended purpose without suspicious or harmful actions. The overall security risk is low, and there is no evidence of malware or malicious code.",
