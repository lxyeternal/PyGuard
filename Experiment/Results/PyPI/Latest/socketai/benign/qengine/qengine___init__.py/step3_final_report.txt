  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network requests, file operations, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data output, environment variable access, file writes, and system calls that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), potentially via obfuscated or suspicious code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, minimal comments, suspicious structure, hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign in most reports, with only Report 1 showing signs of obfuscation and minimal transparency, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious indicators. The other reports describe straightforward, benign scripts with appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. The suspicion in Report 1 is justified by obfuscation but not confirmed malicious activity. Scores are consistent with descriptions, with Report 1 having moderate suspicion (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.5), and others showing low risk (scores 0). Adjustments are minimal; the overall assessment remains low risk with some suspicion in Report 1.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign; suspicion is limited to obfuscation in Report 1. The scores are generally appropriate, with slight room for lowering suspicion if further analysis confirms benign obfuscation. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, and no definitive malicious activity is detected.",
