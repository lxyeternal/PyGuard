  "conclusion": "Most code is benign; suspicion is limited to obfuscation in Report 1. The scores are generally appropriate, with slight room for lowering suspicion if further analysis confirms benign obfuscation. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, and no definitive malicious activity is detected."
