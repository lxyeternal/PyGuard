{
  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder CLI script with an empty 'cli()' function and exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt.",
  "sources": "No input or external data; the code does not read from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external interactions; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the 'cli()' function is empty, and exception handling does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The 'logging' module is used in exception handling but is not imported, which would cause a runtime error; this is a code completeness issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple stub with no logic, malicious code, or obfuscation. The missing import of 'logging' is a minor oversight that could cause runtime errors but does not introduce security risks. The code does not process data, connect externally, or contain suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) due to the missing import issue. The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is a missing import for 'logging', which is a coding oversight, not a security vulnerability. The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1).",
