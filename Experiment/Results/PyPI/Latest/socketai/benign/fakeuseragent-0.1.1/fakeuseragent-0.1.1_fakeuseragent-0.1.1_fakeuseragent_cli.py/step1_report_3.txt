{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function for command-line interface, with no implemented logic.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code does not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; the function 'cli' is empty and only called within the main block.",
  "anomalies": "The 'cli' function is empty, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function and calls it within a try-except block catching KeyboardInterrupt. The except block only logs a debug message, but the 'logging' module is not imported, which could cause an error if executed. There is no actual implementation or suspicious activity; it appears to be a stub or incomplete code. No source-to-sink data flows, no malicious code, or anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal placeholder with no functional logic, no malicious behavior, and no security risks. The main concern is the missing import for 'logging', which might cause runtime errors, but this is unrelated to security.",
