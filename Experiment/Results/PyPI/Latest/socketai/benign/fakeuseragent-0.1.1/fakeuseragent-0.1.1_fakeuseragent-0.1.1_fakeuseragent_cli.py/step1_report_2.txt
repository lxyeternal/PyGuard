{
  "purpose": "Placeholder CLI function with no implemented logic, used as an entry point for a command-line interface application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or data; it only contains an empty function and a conditional block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the CLI function is empty and does not handle data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with an empty CLI function and a simple try-except block. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function and attempts to call it within a main guard. The try-except block catches KeyboardInterrupt and logs a debug message, but the logging module is not imported, which could cause a runtime error. No data processing, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious actions are evident. The code appears to be a skeletal structure, possibly a stub or template for further development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of a stub CLI function and basic exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
