  "purpose": "Display a message indicating the presence of a potentially fake user agent package",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static print statement with no input or data reading",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only outputs a static message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward print statement with no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement that outputs a warning message about 'fake-useragent'. There are no inputs, network calls, data processing, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No suspicious or malicious activity is present, and the message appears to be informational or humorous rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, simple, and non-malicious. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
