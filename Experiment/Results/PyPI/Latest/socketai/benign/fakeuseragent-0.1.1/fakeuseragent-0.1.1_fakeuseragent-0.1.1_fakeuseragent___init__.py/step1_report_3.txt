  "purpose": "Display a message suggesting the installation of a fake-useragent package.",
  "sources": "The print() function reads no external input; it simply outputs a string message.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs data to the console; no untrusted data or external systems are involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to any sensitive sinks; the code only outputs a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The message appears to be a suggestion or taunt rather than malicious; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement that outputs a fixed string. It does not perform any input reading, network activity, or system modification. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The message could imply that the package is a fake or that the user intended to install a specific package, but the code itself is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent. It merely prints a message to the console. There are no security risks or suspicious behaviors detected.",
