{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple print statement likely intended as a warning or humorous message about installing a specific package.",
  "sources": "The source is the print statement which outputs a string to the console.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the standard output (console), which is not a security concern.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: code executes the print statement and outputs the message.",
  "anomalies": "The message hints at a potential issue with the 'fake-useragent' package, but the code itself does not perform any installation, network activity, or malicious behavior. No hidden or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with a string message. There are no inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior. It does not read any external data or execute any commands. The message suggests a warning about 'fake-useragent' but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, serves only to print a message, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
