  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' via open() without context management.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup data without dynamic flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without 'with' statement; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata. It reads a file without a context manager, which is a minor style issue but not security-related. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
