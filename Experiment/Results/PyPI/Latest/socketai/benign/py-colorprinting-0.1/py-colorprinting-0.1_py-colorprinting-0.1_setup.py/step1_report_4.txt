  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks data",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter of setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setuptools usage, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and reads 'README.md' content for long_description. It does not include any code execution, network access, or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. All code is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
