{
  "purpose": "The class provides functionality to print colored text to the terminal using ANSI escape codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the 'text' and 'color' parameters in the 'print' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to the console; no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'text' and 'color' are used directly in a formatted print statement; no external or untrusted data flow beyond standard input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static mapping of color names to ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring. The 'print' method conditionally wraps the text with the appropriate color code if available, otherwise defaults to printing plain text. There is no use of external data sources, network communication, or execution of dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of colored terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for colored printing in terminal environments, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
