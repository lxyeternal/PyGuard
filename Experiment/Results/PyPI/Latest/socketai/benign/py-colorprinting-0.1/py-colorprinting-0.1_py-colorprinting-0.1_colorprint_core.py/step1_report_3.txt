{
  "purpose": "Provide colored text output in the console based on specified color.",
  "sources": "The method receives 'text' and 'color' parameters for printing.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling beyond printing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'text' and 'color' are used directly in a formatted print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The color codes are standard ANSI escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a color mapping and a static method to print text in specified color. It checks if the color is valid before printing, defaulting to plain text otherwise. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears solely to enhance console output with color formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for colored console output with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
