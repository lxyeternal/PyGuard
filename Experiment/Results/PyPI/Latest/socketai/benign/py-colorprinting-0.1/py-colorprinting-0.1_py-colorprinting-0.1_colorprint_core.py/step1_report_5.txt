{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class for printing colored text in the terminal using ANSI escape codes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data read operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print(). The data printed is controlled by input parameters to the print() method.",
  "flows": "The input parameter 'text' flows directly to the print() function, optionally wrapped with color codes if the 'color' parameter matches a key in the colors dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The color codes are standard ANSI escape sequences. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a static method for printing colored text based on a predefined set of ANSI color codes. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling beyond the method parameters, and no malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The logic is straightforward and safe. The only potential concern could be if input is untrusted and printed directly, but this is a normal feature of terminal printing and not malicious. The code is simple, readable, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for colored terminal output with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
