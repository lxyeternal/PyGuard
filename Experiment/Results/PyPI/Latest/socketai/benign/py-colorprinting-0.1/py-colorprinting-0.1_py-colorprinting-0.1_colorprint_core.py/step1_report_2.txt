{
  "purpose": "A utility class for printing colored text to the terminal.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs to the console, which is generally safe.",
  "flows": "The method takes input 'text' and 'color' and outputs formatted text to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The color codes are standard ANSI escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a dictionary of color codes and a static method to print text in specified color. The method checks if the provided color is in the dictionary and prints the text with appropriate ANSI escape sequences, otherwise defaults to plain text. The code does not read untrusted input directly, nor does it perform any network or file operations. It appears to be a simple terminal text coloring utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal text coloring utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. It is safe for use.",
