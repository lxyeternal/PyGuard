  "purpose": "A utility class for printing colored text to the terminal using ANSI escape codes.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'text' and 'color' provided to the static method 'print'.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print function.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into the print statement, with a check for valid color keys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The only minor concern is direct use of parameters, but validation exists for 'color'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static method that prints text in specified colors if the color exists in the predefined dictionary. It uses standard ANSI codes and performs a simple existence check before applying color codes. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is a benign utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The input parameters are used directly but are validated for color existence, minimizing risk. The code's simplicity and standard usage indicate no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for colored terminal output with no malicious or security-threatening features. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
