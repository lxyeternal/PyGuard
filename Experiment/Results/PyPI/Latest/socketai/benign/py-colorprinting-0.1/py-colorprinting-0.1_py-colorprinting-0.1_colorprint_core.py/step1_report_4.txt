{
  "purpose": "Provide colored output printing functionality in the terminal",
  "sources": "The method print() reads the parameters 'text' and 'color' from external calls",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs data to the console; no external data sinks or network communication present",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'text' and 'color' flow into the print() method, which then outputs colored text based on the color mapping",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method to print colored text in the terminal using ANSI escape sequences. It uses a predefined color mapping dictionary. The print() method checks if the specified color exists in the dictionary, then prints the text with the appropriate ANSI codes; otherwise, it defaults to printing plain text. There are no input validation issues, no external data sources, or network activity. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for colored terminal output with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
