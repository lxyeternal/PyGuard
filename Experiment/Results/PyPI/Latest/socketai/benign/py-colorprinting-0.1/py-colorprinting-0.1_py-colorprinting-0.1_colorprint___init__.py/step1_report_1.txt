  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; very minimal code, straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class from a relative module. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The import statement itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall code is clean, minimal, and typical of package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file for module import setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
