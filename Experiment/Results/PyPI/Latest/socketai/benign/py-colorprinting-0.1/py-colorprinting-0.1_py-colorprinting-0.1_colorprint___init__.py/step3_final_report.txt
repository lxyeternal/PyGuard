  "purpose": "Package initialization that imports the ColorPrint class from the core module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .core import ColorPrint",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statement directly loads ColorPrint class into namespace; no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard __init__.py file that imports a class from a local module. It does not handle input, output, or external data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The import is typical for Python packages and does not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization file with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
