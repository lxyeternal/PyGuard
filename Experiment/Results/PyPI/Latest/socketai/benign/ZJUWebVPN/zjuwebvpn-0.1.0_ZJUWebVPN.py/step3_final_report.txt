{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebVPN login session with URL rewriting, using RSA encryption with server-provided keys to securely transmit credentials.",
  "sources": "Fetches RSA public key components and CSRF code from server responses; reads input data during login request.",
  "sinks": "Encrypts credentials before transmission; rewrites URLs for WebVPN routing.",
  "flows": "Fetch RSA keys and CSRF code -> Encrypt credentials with RSA -> Submit login request -> On success, set login flag -> Rewrite URLs for requests passing through WebVPN.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard VPN login procedures: fetching RSA keys, encrypting credentials securely, and URL rewriting for VPN routing. It employs server-provided RSA keys, avoiding hardcoded secrets, and uses clear, well-structured logic. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The URL rewriting follows predictable patterns consistent with WebVPN practices. The cryptography and request flow are standard and secure. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the implementation aligns with typical VPN client behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a WebVPN login client with URL rewriting. It employs standard cryptographic practices and URL manipulation. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
