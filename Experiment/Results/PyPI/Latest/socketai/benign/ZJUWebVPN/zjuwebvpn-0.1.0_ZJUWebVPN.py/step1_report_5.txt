  "purpose": "A custom requests.Session subclass to handle login and URL rewriting for ZJU WebVPN access.",
  "sources": "Reads: GET request to LOGIN_AUTH_URL, POST request to LOGIN_PSW_URL, URL parsing in convert_url method.",
  "sinks": "POST request to login_psw.csp with encrypted credentials, URL rewriting in convert_url method.",
  "flows": "GET request to fetch RSA key -> RSA encryption of credentials -> POST request with encrypted data -> login status check -> URL rewriting in request method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials found beyond login URLs; the code encrypts credentials but does not leak data; URL rewriting logic is straightforward. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard login procedures for a web VPN using RSA encryption for credentials, which appears legitimate and typical for secure login workflows. The URL rewriting method replaces hostname dots with hyphens and appends domain suffix, which is consistent with the WebVPN URL format. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The code does not contain any obfuscated or hidden code segments. All functions are standard, and the flow aligns with expected VPN login behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a WebVPN client session with URL rewriting and secure login. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware characteristics. The encryption of credentials is proper and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears safe and purposeful without security threats.",
