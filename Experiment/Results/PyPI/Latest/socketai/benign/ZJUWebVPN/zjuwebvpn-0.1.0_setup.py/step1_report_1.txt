  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ZJUWebVPN Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; the script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input-output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; author information appears normal, no dynamic code execution, no network or data manipulation code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging and defines package metadata including name, version, author info, description, URL, modules, dependencies, and classifiers. The author email and name appear standard; dependencies are common Python packages. The code reads a local README file for description. No code that executes untrusted input, performs network actions, or contains malicious logic is present. The license is an open-source license (WTFPL). There is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior within this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
