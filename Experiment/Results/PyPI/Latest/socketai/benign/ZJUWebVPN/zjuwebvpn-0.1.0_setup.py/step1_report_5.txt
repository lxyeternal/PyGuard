{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'ZJUWebVPN' including metadata, dependencies, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata defined within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily defines package setup configuration",
  "flows": "N/A – the code is static configuration without data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, URL, modules, dependencies, classifiers, license, and Python version requirements. It reads the long description from README.md with specified encoding. No user input, environment variables, or external data handling occurs at runtime. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The package dependencies are standard, and the license is an open license (WTFPL).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard package configuration script.",
