  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Author name 'eWloYW8' appears as a base64 string, which could be an obfuscation or encoding, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The author string may be base64-encoded but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate. The author name's encoding is not inherently malicious and does not impact security. The script's purpose is purely packaging metadata, with no indicators of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
