{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ZJUWebVPN', including metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks related to untrusted data processing, external data transmission, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading the 'README.md' file into 'long_description' during setup, with no data passed to other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; standard setup configuration with no embedded code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads metadata and dependencies, and loads 'README.md' content for description. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or handling of untrusted inputs. All operations are typical for package setup scripts and contain no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply prepares the package for distribution, with no embedded or hidden malicious code.",
