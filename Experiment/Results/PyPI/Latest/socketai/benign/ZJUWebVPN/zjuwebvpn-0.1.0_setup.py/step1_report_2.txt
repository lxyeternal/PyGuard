  "purpose": "Defines package setup configuration for distributing the 'ZJUWebVPN' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The author name appears as a base64 string 'eWloYW8', which could be intentional or an obfuscation attempt, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the 'README.md' for the long description. No code execution, user input, or network activity is present. The dependencies include 'requests' and 'pycryptodome', which are common cryptography and HTTP libraries. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. The author field is a string that could be an obfuscated name, but this alone isn't malicious. Overall, this is standard setup code with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks detected.",
