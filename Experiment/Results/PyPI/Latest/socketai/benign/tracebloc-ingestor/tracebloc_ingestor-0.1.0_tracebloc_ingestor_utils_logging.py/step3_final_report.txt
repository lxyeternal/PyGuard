  "purpose": "Configure logging with a unified format across the application, optionally using custom settings from a Config object.",
  "sources": "Config object for LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT; sys.stdout for log output",
  "sinks": "Console output to stdout; no untrusted data processed",
  "flows": "Config parameters influence formatter and log level; logs are emitted to stdout",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging setup function that initializes a console handler, applies formatting, removes existing handlers to prevent duplication, and adjusts log levels for specific libraries. It uses optional configuration parameters, defaults sensibly, and follows best practices. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure constructs are present. The minimal security risk arises from potential log exposure if misconfigured, but this is a common concern rather than a flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to potential misconfiguration leading to sensitive info exposure, but the code itself is safe.",
