  "purpose": "Configure logging for the application with customizable format and level settings",
  "sources": "config object for LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT; sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "logging output to stdout; potentially logs sensitive info if misconfigured",
  "flows": "config data -> logging setup -> console handler -> root logger -> output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with optional custom configuration, establishing formatting and log levels. It removes existing handlers to prevent duplication and sets specific log levels for certain libraries to suppress verbose logs. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a standard logging setup routine.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, well-structured logging configuration function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
