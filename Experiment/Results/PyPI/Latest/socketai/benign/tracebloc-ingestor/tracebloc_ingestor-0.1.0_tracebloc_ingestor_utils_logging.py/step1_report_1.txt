  "purpose": "Configure application logging with optional custom settings, including log format, level, and date format.",
  "sources": "Configuration object (config) providing LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT; sys.stdout for console output.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout; potential exposure of sensitive data if log format includes sensitive info (not the case here).",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from config, used to set up a logging formatter and handler, then attached to the root logger.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard logging setup patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging configuration, selecting log level and format from optional Config object or defaults. It creates a console handler, sets a formatter, and attaches it to the root logger, removing existing handlers to prevent duplication. Additional log level adjustments for specific libraries are also made. The code appears standard and does not include obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical logging setup function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages handlers and log levels without exposing sensitive data. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
