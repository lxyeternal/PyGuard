  "purpose": "Configure application logging with customizable formats and levels",
  "sources": "Config object attributes (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT), sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "Logging output to sys.stdout; logging configuration potentially affecting log visibility",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters from config object or defaults -> Formatter setup -> Handler setup -> Logger configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network or file operations, no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging for an application, allowing customization via a config object. It creates a console stream handler, formats logs with standard messages, and adjusts log levels for specific libraries. The code follows best practices for logging setup without any suspicious or malicious activity. It does not handle or transmit untrusted input, nor does it include obfuscated or malicious code segments. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no malicious or security concern signals. It properly manages logging handlers and levels, and it suppresses verbose logs from common libraries without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious actions.",
