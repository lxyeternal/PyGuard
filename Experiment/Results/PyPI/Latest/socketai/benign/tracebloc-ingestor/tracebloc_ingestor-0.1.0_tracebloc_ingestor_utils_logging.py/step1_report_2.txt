  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for the application, including formatting and log levels.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from an optional Config object, sys.stdout for output, and logging modules for settings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs logs to stdout; does not process untrusted data for security impact.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from Config (if provided) influence log level and format; logs are written to stdout with specified format.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with configurable parameters, defaults, and suppression of verbose logs. It carefully removes existing handlers before adding a new one, ensuring no duplicate logs. It uses standard logging practices without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be a standard logging setup function.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical logging configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
