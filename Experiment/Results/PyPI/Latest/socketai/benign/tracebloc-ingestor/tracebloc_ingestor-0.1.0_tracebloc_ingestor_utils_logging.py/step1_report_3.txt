  "purpose": "Configure application-wide logging with customizable formats and levels, including suppression of verbose library logs.",
  "sources": "Configuration object (config) providing LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from config object, then used to set up log formatter and handlers; no flow to external or untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. Usage of standard logging setup and configuration appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with optional custom configurations, ensuring a clean environment by removing existing handlers before adding a new console handler. It adjusts log levels for specific libraries to reduce verbosity. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data processing is involved. All operations are standard and safe. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It effectively manages logging configurations and suppresses verbose library logs without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
