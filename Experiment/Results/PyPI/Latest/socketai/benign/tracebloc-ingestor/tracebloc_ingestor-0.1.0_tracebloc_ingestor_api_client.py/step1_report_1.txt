  "purpose": "A Python API client class to interact with a remote server for data management, including authentication, data transmission, and dataset creation.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data (API endpoint, credentials, title), input data records for batch sending, schema for metadata, and parameters for dataset creation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads containing sensitive data and credentials; GET requests for preparation and metadata generation; potential exposure of tokens in request headers.",
  "flows": "Sources of credentials and data flow into HTTP request payloads and headers; tokens used for authorization flow from authentication to subsequent API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors present. No suspicious network calls or obfuscation detected. Logging outputs sensitive info but within expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code manages API interactions securely using requests.Session with retries, handles authentication with credentials from config, and sends JSON data in POST requests. Logging is used to record operations, including sensitive info like tokens and responses. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Usage of environment variables or config files for credentials indicates proper practices. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation for data management tasks. It correctly handles secure API communication, uses proper error handling, and does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage behaviors. No security risks or malware indications found.",
