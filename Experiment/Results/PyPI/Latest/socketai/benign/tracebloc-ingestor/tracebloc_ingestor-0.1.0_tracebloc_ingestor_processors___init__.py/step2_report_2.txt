  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n\n- The code is minimal: it imports a class from a local module and defines an `__all__` list.\n- All reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no processing logic, and no suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a module setup.\n\n**2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no security issues, no data handling, and no malicious activity.\n- No false positives or overlooked issues are apparent.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is justified.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n\n- Since the code is purely structural, with no data processing, no external calls, and no obfuscation, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n**5. Pay attention to the malware score:**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n**6. Challenge claims based on assumptions:**\n\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code inspection.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n- The confidence level of 1 reflects certainty in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is a simple module declaration with no processing logic, input handling, or external communication.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe current scoring is appropriate. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation present        |\n| Security Risk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data handling, or external risks       |\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' assessments and supports maintaining the current scores.",
