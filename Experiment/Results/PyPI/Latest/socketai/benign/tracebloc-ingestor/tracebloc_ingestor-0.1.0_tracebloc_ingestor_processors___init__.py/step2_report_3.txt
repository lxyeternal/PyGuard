  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is minimal: it imports a class from a local module and defines an export list. No data processing, user input, external communication, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and structurally standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident; the assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score across reports is 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is purely structural with no data handling or execution logic, there's no reason to assign a higher risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they analyze the code as is.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports a class and declares its public API.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the comprehensive analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
