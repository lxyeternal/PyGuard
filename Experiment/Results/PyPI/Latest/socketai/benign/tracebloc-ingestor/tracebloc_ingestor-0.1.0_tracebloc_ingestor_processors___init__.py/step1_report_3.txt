  "purpose": "This module documents and exports the BaseProcessor class for data processing components of the Tracebloc Data Ingestor package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the BaseProcessor class from a relative module '.base'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; no data processing or input handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines and exports a class reference.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The module is simple and primarily serves as an interface or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, defines an export list with that class, and contains a descriptive comment. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Python module practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module that documents and exports a base class for data processors. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation.",
