  "purpose": "Documenting data processing components of the Tracebloc Data Ingestor package, including a base class and custom processors.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.base), no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class import and specifies an exported list containing this class. It contains no data processing logic, input handling, or external communications. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The simplicity and standard structure suggest normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports a base class and declares an export, showing no suspicious behavior.",
