  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of an import statement, a docstring, and an `__all__` declaration.\n   - No data processing, input handling, or external communication is present.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as a module definition or documentation component.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments are cautious and appropriate given the code's minimal scope.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues, elevating the risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is structural and documentation-oriented.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the minimal, straightforward nature of the code, and the unanimous agreement among reports, I concur with the assigned scores. The code poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is purely structural.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0              |\n\nThis code is entirely benign and serves as a simple module setup within a larger package.",
