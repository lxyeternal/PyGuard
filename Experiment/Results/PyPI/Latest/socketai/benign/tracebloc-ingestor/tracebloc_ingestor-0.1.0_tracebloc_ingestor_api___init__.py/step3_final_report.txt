  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and potential malware indicators.",
  "sources": "Import statements, setup functions, data processing routines, environment variables, network communication points, external file reads, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions that could leak or exfiltrate data, system calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network sockets or file outputs, potentially indicating data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network connections to suspicious domains, no malicious payloads, minimal or no operational logic.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the minimal or benign nature of the code, noting only import/setup statements or general descriptions of data handling. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the lack of suspicious activity. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting limited code context. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate, with no false positives. The uniform low risk and malware scores align with the benign assessments, and the descriptions support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment indicates a low security risk with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
