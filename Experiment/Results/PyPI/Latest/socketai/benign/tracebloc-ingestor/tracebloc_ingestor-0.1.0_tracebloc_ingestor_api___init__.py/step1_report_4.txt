{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing basic data processing and network communication tasks, possibly related to data collection or reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules such as network requests or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file writes, or data serialization points that could send untrusted or sensitive data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources such as environment variables or input functions, processed internally, then transmitted via network sockets or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or malicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical data handling: it imports standard libraries, retrieves environment variables or input, processes data, and sends data over network connections or writes to disk. No unusual patterns, no suspicious URL requests, and no obfuscated constructs are present. The code adheres to common coding practices, with no evident backdoors, credential theft mechanisms, or malicious payloads. Without external context or hidden code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is consistent with normal application behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or supply chain sabotage features. The overall risk is low.",
