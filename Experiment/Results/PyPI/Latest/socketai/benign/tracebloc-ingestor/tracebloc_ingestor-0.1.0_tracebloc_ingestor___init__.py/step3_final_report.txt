  "purpose": "Package initializer exposing core classes for data ingestion, configuration, database, API client, and processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.config, .database, .api.client, .ingestors, .processors.base).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process data or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py or setup module that imports internal components and defines package metadata. It contains no data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package initializer with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary.",
