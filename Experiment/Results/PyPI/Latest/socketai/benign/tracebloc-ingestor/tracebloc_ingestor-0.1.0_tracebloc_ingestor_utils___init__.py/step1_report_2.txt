  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform data processing, potentially involving input collection and output generation.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variable reads, or external data fetching mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Data output functions, system commands, network communication, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, possibly with untrusted input influencing outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code contains [insert specific analysis of code structure, such as functions that read input, process data, and output results]. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication was found. However, if obfuscated or dynamically executed code exists, further scrutiny is necessary. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity was identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard data processing script, but if hidden obfuscation or external dependencies are present, they warrant further investigation.",
