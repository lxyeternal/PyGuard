  "reasoning": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious payloads and obfuscation, with low risk scores reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets. However, Report 4 involves dynamic code execution features (eval/exec), which pose inherent risks if untrusted input is involved. To better reflect this potential, the securityRisk score is increased from 0.3 to 0.4, acknowledging the elevated caution without assuming malicious intent. This adjustment aligns with best practices in supply chain security assessments, balancing the observed evidence with inherent dynamic features.",
