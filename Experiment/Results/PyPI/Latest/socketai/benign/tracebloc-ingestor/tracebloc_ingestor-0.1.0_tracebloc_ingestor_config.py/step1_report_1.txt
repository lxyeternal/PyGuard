  "purpose": "Configuration setup for database, API, paths, and logging using environment variables",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv) for database credentials, API endpoints, paths, and logging settings",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables that contain sensitive information such as DB_PASSWORD, CLIENT_PASSWORD, and paths that could leak sensitive data if accessed improperly",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to class attributes; these could influence database connections, API calls, or file paths, but no direct untrusted data flow to execution or network in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond defaults, no suspicious code behavior, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The API_ENDPOINT selection based on environment is standard. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass Config that loads configuration parameters from environment variables, including database credentials, API endpoints, file paths, and logging settings. The API_ENDPOINT is selected dynamically based on the EDGE_ENV variable, with a default fallback. No malicious or suspicious logic, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of environment variables is standard and not inherently malicious, though sensitive info such as passwords are stored in environment variables, which should be protected in deployment. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup that reads environment variables for various settings. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is detected. The only potential concern is the exposure of sensitive info via environment variables, which is typical in deployment but should be secured properly. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
