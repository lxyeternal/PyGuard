  "purpose": "Configuration loader that reads environment variables for database credentials, API endpoints, paths, and logging settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, API_ENDPOINTS, EDGE_ENV, CLIENT_USERNAME, CLIENT_PASSWORD, STORAGE_PATH, SRC_PATH, DEST_PATH, TABLE_NAME, LABEL_FILE, COMPANY, TITLE, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read directly into class attributes; no active data flow or external calls occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data; construction of DEST_PATH via os.path.join with potentially unvalidated env vars; default insecure values like empty passwords.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class that loads environment variables into a dataclass. It uses standard practices without obfuscation or malicious code. The main security considerations involve the management of environment variables, which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The risk and malware scores are low, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The potential for path traversal or credential exposure exists if environment variables are misconfigured, but this is a common security concern rather than an active threat. Overall, the code is benign, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The primary security concern is the secure management of environment variables, not the code itself. The existing scores are justified and do not require adjustment.",
