  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class that loads environment variables for database, API endpoints, paths, credentials, and logging settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, BATCH_SIZE, EDGE_ENV, EDGE_USERNAME, EDGE_PASSWORD, STORAGE_PATH, SRC_PATH, DEST_PATH, TABLE_NAME, LABEL_FILE, COMPANY, TITLE, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, LOG_DATE_FORMAT.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No direct use of untrusted data in dangerous functions. Paths are constructed from environment variables, but no direct file operations or system calls are shown.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at class definition time; these are assigned to class attributes, which are used for configuration. No dynamic execution or data flow observed beyond simple assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data such as passwords and credentials. Path construction using environment variables could lead to insecure paths if manipulated. No hardcoded secrets but reliance on env variables for credentials. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configuration parameters from environment variables, which is standard practice. It uses environment variables for database credentials, API endpoints, paths, and logging. The use of os.getenv with defaults helps prevent errors but can also be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. The API endpoint selection depends on an environment variable, which is typical. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or file operations directly, so attack vectors are limited. There are no indications of malware or malicious intent; the main concern is the reliance on external environment variables for sensitive data, which should be managed securely. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration loader with no malicious or harmful code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class that loads environment variables for system setup. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The primary security consideration is ensuring that environment variables, especially credentials, are managed securely and not exposed. There are no anomalies or suspicious activities detected.",
