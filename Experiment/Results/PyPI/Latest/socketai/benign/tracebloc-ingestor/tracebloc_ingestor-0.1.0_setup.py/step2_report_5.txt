  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code only reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and invokes setuptools.setup() with this data.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external command invocation, or handling of untrusted input beyond static file reading.\n- No network activity, cryptographic operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Review of the Scores:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code clarity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign a risk score of 0, indicating no security risk. This is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the straightforward analysis.\n- The scores are reasonable and appropriately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all correctly assigned as 0.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus of the reports.",
