  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'tracebloc_ingestor' Python package for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. No external data or user input is processed during setup.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md, requirements.txt) during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. Usage of standard setuptools functions and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown file and a requirements list, then invokes setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data beyond reading local files. The code structure and content follow typical setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
