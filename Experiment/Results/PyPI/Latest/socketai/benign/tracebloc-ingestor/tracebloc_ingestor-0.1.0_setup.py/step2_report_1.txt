  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n   - It reads static files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`) and invokes `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, external commands, or handling of untrusted input during runtime.\n   - The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Malware**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Anomalies**:\n   - No anomalies, such as code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns, are identified.\n   - The code follows typical packaging conventions and performs no risky operations.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, as the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n5. **Overall Risk Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard setup script.\n   - There are no signs of supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.",
