{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tracebloc_ingestor', including reading long description and dependencies from external files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; static package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables used in setup(), with no further data manipulation or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks using setuptools, reading static files and configuring package metadata. It does not process untrusted input beyond reading static files, nor does it contain any network, cryptographic, or system modification code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain risks.",
