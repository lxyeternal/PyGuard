  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, reading static files for description and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files; static data used in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; static data only",
  "flows": "Reading files -> passing content to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reads and setup invocation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging. It reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, which is standard and safe. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious or risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
