  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'tracebloc_ingestor', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution effects; no external or untrusted input is processed at runtime",
  "flows": "Reads files 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' to assign data to variables, then passes these variables to the setup() function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; standard setup script pattern with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The script opens and reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, then uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, and no network operations. The code follows common packaging conventions and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging; there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
