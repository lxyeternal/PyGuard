{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'tracebloc_ingestor' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being used in a dangerous manner",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables used for package setup, with no further processing that could introduce vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup.py pattern used for package configuration",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') to populate package metadata and dependencies. It then invokes 'setup()' with this data. The code uses safe file handling and standard setuptools functions. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard package setup tasks with no suspicious behavior.",
