  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for model intents and data categories used throughout an application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; all values are hardcoded within classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining constants and simple class methods without dynamic code execution or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant definitions and class methods returning static lists of strings. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The class methods provide utility functions for retrieving and validating static data, which are typical in application configuration modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and enumeration setup with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured constants module.",
