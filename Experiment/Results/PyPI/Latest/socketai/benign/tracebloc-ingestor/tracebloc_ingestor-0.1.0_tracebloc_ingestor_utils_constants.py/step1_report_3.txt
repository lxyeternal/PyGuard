  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for API timeout, intents, and data categories used throughout the application.",
  "sources": "Constants and class methods that provide lists of valid intents and data categories.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted sources identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code mainly provides static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. The code consists solely of constant definitions and simple class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for API timeout and two classes, Intent and DataCategory, with class methods to retrieve all possible values and validate categories. No user input handling, external data reading, or dynamic execution present. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious intent detected. The code is straightforward and serves as configuration definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining constants and enumerations, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and normal.",
