  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for model training and classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment (API_TIMEOUT), class attribute definitions, class method calls for retrieving lists of constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; methods are only returning predefined class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard class and constant definitions without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and enumeration classes for intents and data categories, including methods to retrieve all values and validate categories. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data handling from untrusted sources. The purpose is purely to provide static, predefined configuration data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
