  "purpose": "Defines constants and enumeration classes for intents and data categories used in model training and classification.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes and class methods returning predefined lists of strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions with no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static constants and simple class methods, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module defining constants and enumeration classes with methods returning fixed lists. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed. The code contains no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All functions are simple static list returns or validations. The absence of data flows involving untrusted data, no secrets, and no malicious code indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
