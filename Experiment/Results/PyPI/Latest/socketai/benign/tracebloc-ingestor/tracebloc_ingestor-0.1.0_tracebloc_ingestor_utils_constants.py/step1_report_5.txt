  "purpose": "Define constants and enumerations for application configuration, intents, and data categories.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment (API_TIMEOUT), class attribute definitions and methods (Intent, DataCategory)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions and class methods returning predefined string lists. No user input, external data, or untrusted data sources are involved. There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants and enumeration definitions module with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
