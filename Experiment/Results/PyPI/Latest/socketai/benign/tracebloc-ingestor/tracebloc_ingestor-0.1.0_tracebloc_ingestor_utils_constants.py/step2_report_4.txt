  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, static, defining constants and enums.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or data flows involving untrusted sources are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code serves as configuration or enumeration helpers, which are standard practice.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely definitional, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- None of the reports mention any suspicious logic, hidden code, or malicious intent.\n- The code does not process user input, environment variables, or external data.\n- The methods are simple static list returns and validations.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, safe, and standard for configuration purposes.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
