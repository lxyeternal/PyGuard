  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only static data used for configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static constants are used solely for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant definitions and class methods returning predefined lists of strings. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve as configuration for intents and data categories. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as configuration constants and enumeration helpers, which are standard and safe.",
