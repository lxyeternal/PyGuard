  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the validity of their assessments, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds the code to be a standard database utility with no malicious behavior, minor concern about printing connection string.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies no malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified, considering the print statement could leak credentials if logs are insecure, but that's a hygiene issue, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, notes standard database management code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The code's logic is straightforward, with standard exception handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of raw SQL for database creation and printing connection string, which could be security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The use of string interpolation for database creation commands and printing connection string are minor security hygiene issues but not malicious. No obfuscation or malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes potential risks from raw SQL and printing connection string, but overall standard database utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious behavior; the minor issues are related to logging practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical database utility, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly lower risk, which is justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward database management functions. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), mostly due to printing connection strings and raw SQL execution without parameterization in database creation commands. These are hygiene issues, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — minor security hygiene issues, no significant supply chain or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard database utility module with no malicious or obfuscated code. The minor security concerns are hygiene-related and do not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores. Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0; the risk score can remain around 0.1-0.2, reflecting minor security hygiene considerations.",
