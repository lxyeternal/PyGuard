  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point script that imports and executes the main() function from the 'code_index_mcp.server' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'code_index_mcp.server' and the '__main__' check invoking main()",
  "sinks": "The call to main() could potentially lead to untrusted code execution depending on 'main()' implementation",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' and, if run directly, executes main(), passing control to the imported function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python entry point that delegates execution to 'main()' from an external module. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are visible. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()' within 'code_index_mcp.server', which is not provided. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the code itself appears benign. The low security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports appropriately reflects the uncertainty about 'main()' but does not indicate malicious intent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python entry point with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external 'main()' implementation. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0; the risk score should be 0 given the code alone, but a conservative 0.1 is acceptable to account for the unknown 'main()' behavior.",
