{
  "purpose": "Main entry point that initiates the execution of the code-index-mcp package by calling its main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from 'code_index_mcp.server' and the __name__ variable in the if statement.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function from 'code_index_mcp.server' is invoked; potential data flow depends on its implementation, but not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from the script start to calling 'main()' if the script is run directly; specific data flows depend on 'main()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the script is a minimal standard Python entry point with no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a local module and executes it when run directly. It is a common pattern for Python entry scripts. No embedded or obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, or unusual constructs are present. The security risk depends on the 'main()' implementation, which is not provided. Given only this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward entry point for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided content.",
