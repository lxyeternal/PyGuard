  "purpose": "Main entry point for the code-index-mcp package, initiating the server.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from code_index_mcp.server import main' and the execution of 'main()' within the '__main__' block.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' which likely executes core functionality, but no direct sink of untrusted data is visible here.",
  "flows": "The script imports the 'main' function and executes it when run as a script; the data flow depends entirely on the implementation of 'main()' in 'code_index_mcp.server'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present in this minimal code; it is a typical entry point with a standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a module and executes it in the script entry point. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no obfuscation. All functionality depends on the imported 'main()' function. Since the source code for 'main()' is not provided, security assessment is limited to this snippet. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. Its security posture depends on the implementation of 'main()' in 'code_index_mcp.server', which is not visible here.",
