{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for the code-index-mcp package, likely initiating the server or main process.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'code_index_mcp.server'; the if __name__ == '__main__' block executing 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function called within the script; potential for untrusted data flow depends on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import leads to calling 'main()' when script is executed directly; data flow depends on 'main()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as an entry point, importing and executing 'main()'. It contains no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts. Since 'main()' is imported and invoked directly, the security concerns depend on its internal implementation, which is not provided. The script itself is benign and appears to be a typical application entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its security risk is very low, contingent on the safety of the imported 'main()' function. No malware indicators detected.",
