  "purpose": "Main entry point for the code-index-mcp package, initiating the server.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'main' from 'code_index_mcp.server'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' when the script is executed directly.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the script being run, calling 'main()' from the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The script is very minimal, only invoking 'main()'. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a straightforward entry point, importing and executing the main function from another module. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard pattern for launching a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign entry point script that delegates control to the 'main()' function of the 'code_index_mcp.server' module. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
