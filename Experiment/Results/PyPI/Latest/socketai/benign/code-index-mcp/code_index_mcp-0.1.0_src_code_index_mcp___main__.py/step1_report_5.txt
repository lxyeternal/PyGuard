{
  "purpose": "Main entry point that initiates the server component of the code-index-mcp package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from 'code_index_mcp.server'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' potentially leads to execution of code within the imported module, but there are no direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The script simply invokes the imported 'main()' function if run as the main program; no data flow analysis is possible without the implementation details of 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for a Python main entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python entry point that imports and executes the 'main' function from a module within the package. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Since 'main()' is called directly without arguments or user input, potential malicious behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'main' in 'code_index_mcp.server'. Without inspecting that function, no malicious intent can be inferred. The code itself is clean, simple, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as an entry point to invoke a main function in a package, with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Any security concerns should be directed at the implementation of 'main()' in the imported module.",
