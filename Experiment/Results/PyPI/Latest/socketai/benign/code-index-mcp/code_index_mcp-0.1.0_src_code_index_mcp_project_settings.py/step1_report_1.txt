  "purpose": "Manage project settings and persistent data for the Code Index MCP server, including configuration, file index, and content cache handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system temporary directories, filesystem operations (exists, access, list, read, write), file open/read/write, and hash calculations on project path.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, directory creation/deletion, pickle dump/load, JSON dump/load, and print statements for logging.",
  "flows": "Initialization involves reading environment and filesystem info; save/load functions interact with filesystem via read/write of JSON and pickle files; clear function deletes and restores files; stats gathers filesystem metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Directory and file handling appears standard. Uses hash of project path for directory naming, which is a benign technique. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem operations: creating directories, writing JSON and pickle files, and reading environment info. It creates a cache directory in the system temp directory with a README file, handles errors gracefully, and uses hashing to generate unique directory names for project data. No code patterns suggest malicious intent such as network communication, system disruption, or data exfiltration. The use of pickle is noted but limited to local file serialization without external communication. All read/write operations are confined to filesystem. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The logic is straightforward, focusing on configuration management and cache handling with appropriate fallbacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements legitimate project settings management with proper error handling and filesystem interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The use of pickle is limited to local data serialization, and no network activity or system damage functions are present. The overall security risk is low.",
