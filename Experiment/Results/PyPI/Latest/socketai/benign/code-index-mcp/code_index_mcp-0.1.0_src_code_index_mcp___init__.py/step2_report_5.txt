  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, documentation-like code snippet consisting of a module-level docstring and a version string.\n- No executable code, data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No obfuscation or secret leaks are evident.\n- The code is purely descriptive/documentational.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are present in the reports; they are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, a very low risk score is justified, but not zero if considering potential misclassification or future risks.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The report with a **securityRisk of 0.1** (Report 5) suggests a very minimal concern. Since the code is purely documentation, this seems slightly overcautious but not unreasonable.\n- The **confidence** scores are high, reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I would agree with the current scores for all reports:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one report, which is acceptable.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, simple, and serves as metadata or documentation. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always monitor for future code changes, especially if this module evolves into executable code or handles data, to reassess risk accordingly.",
