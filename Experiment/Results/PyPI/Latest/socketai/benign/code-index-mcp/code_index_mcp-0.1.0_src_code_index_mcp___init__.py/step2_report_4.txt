  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, documentation-style snippet with only a module docstring and a version string.\n- No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code elements are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet itself contains **no executable logic**, no data handling, no network calls, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The reports correctly identify this as a benign, metadata or documentation fragment.\n\n### Flaws or errors:\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 or near zero) are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The **malware scores** are correctly set to 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correctly 0.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are appropriately very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The **confidence** scores are high, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, there's no reason to justify higher scores.\n- The one report with a securityRisk of 0.1 and confidence 0.9 is acceptable, given the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero; no security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.",
