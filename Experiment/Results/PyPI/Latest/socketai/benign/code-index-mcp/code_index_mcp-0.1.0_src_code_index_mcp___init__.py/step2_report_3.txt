  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, documentation-style snippet consisting of a module docstring and a version string.\n- No executable code, data input/output, external calls, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, one at 0.9), and all report scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero or near-zero.\n- The code appears benign, serving as metadata or documentation for a package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippet is just a docstring and a version variable, with no signs of code execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent with the code; they correctly identify it as benign and documentation-only.\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n- The only minor point is the last report's security risk score (0.1), which might be slightly overcautious given the absence of any code activity.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** Zero or near-zero is appropriate; the last report's 0.1 might be slightly high but not unreasonable given the cautious approach.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed for the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and purely metadata. The scores are appropriate, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if being very cautious, but 0 is fine)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, documentation-only module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the snippet.",
