  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module metadata and documentation placeholder, providing version information and a descriptive comment.",
  "sources": "The module docstring and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code contains only static strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and human-readable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring and a version string variable, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero or near-zero. The minimal nature of the code indicates no malicious intent or security concerns. Slight variations in security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are overly cautious but acceptable given the context. Overall, the code is a simple, documentation-only module with no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as metadata or documentation. All reports are accurate; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low or zero security risk score, reflecting its harmless nature.",
