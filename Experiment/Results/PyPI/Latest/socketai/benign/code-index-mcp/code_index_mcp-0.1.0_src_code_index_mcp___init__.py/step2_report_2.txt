  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign module with only a docstring and a version string.\n- No input/output, data flow, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements are identified.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and malware scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippet itself is straightforward and does not contain any executable logic, making malware or obfuscation unlikely.\n- The only potential concern is the last report's securityRisk score of 0.1, which seems high given the analysis. Since the code is purely documentation, this should be closer to zero.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are all zero, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all zero, also consistent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n- The obfuscated scores are all zero, which is correct.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly zero, except for report 5, which has 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n**Potential issues with the reports:**\n- No actual issues are present in the code, so the reports are accurate.\n- The only point to challenge is the securityRisk score in report 5; it should be 0 instead of 0.1.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores should reflect this.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Security risk score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The securityRisk score in report 5 should be corrected from 0.1 to 0.\n- No changes needed for malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is entirely safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should all be zero, reflecting its benign status.",
