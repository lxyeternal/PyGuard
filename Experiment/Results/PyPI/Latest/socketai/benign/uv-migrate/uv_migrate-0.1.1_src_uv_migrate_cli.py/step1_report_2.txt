    "Reading the input pyproject.toml file using open()",
    "Parsing the file content with tomlkit.parse()",

  "flows": [
    "Read input file → parse contents → process and transform data → write to output file",
    "User specifies input/output paths via command-line options",
    "Transformations include reading sections, modifying or skipping certain keys, and writing the result"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data present",
    "No use of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution",
    "No obfuscated code features observed",
    "The script performs straightforward file I/O and data transformation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs a structured conversion of a pyproject.toml file by reading, parsing, transforming, and writing configuration data. It uses standard libraries (pathlib, tomlkit, click) for file handling, command-line interface, and TOML processing. The code reads input data from files, processes project and dependency sections, and outputs a modified configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of open() for file operations, but it is standard and used securely within context. The process is transparent and straightforward, with no suspicious or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility script for project configuration conversion with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It reads and writes files in a safe and controlled manner, with clear processing steps. No malware or security risks are identified.",
