{
  "purpose": "This script converts a Poetry-based pyproject.toml to a uv-compatible pyproject.toml format, facilitating project migration.",
  "sources": "Reads input file specified by --input (default pyproject.toml) and reads the file content.",
  "sinks": "Writes to output file specified by --output (default pyproject.uv.toml). No sinks process untrusted data; only file read/write occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads input file, parses TOML content, transforms data, and writes output file. No network or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Uses standard libraries and typical file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file input/output operations with standard libraries, parses and manipulates TOML data structures, and writes transformed data. It does not include network operations, system commands, or code execution. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward for project configuration migration. All operations are contained within file processing and data transformation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for project file conversion with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard parsing and writing procedures without external communications or secret handling.",
