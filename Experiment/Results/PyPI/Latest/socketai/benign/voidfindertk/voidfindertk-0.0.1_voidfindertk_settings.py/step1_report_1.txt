  "purpose": "This module manages configuration settings for VoidFinderTK, including creation, reading, and updating configuration files and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from YAML files, environment variables, and default settings.",
  "sinks": "Updates configuration objects based on input data, writes YAML files, and reads environment variables.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files and environment variables into the _Settings object, which can be serialized back into YAML.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. Usage of environment variables and file operations is standard for configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks including loading, updating, and saving YAML configuration files, as well as updating settings from environment variables. It does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. All operations are read/write with local files and environment variables. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The use of logging for warnings about missing configuration files is typical. The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration management module for VoidFinderTK. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It operates securely within its scope, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
