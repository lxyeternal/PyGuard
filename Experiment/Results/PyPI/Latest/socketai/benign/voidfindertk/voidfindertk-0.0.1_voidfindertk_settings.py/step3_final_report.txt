  "purpose": "Configuration management for VoidFinderTK, handling YAML files, environment variables, and default settings.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables with prefix 'VFTK_', reads YAML configuration files from default and current directory paths, and creates default config if missing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; primarily file I/O and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and YAML files update the configuration object; no external network or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and safe practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, immutable configuration handler that reads and writes YAML files, updates from environment variables, and creates default configs if needed. It employs safe libraries (yaml.safe_load, safe_dump), manages configuration via attrs data classes, and does not perform any network activity, code injection, or malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable handling is standard, and the creation of default config files is typical for such modules. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed. The logic is sound, with appropriate error handling and clear separation of concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration management module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
