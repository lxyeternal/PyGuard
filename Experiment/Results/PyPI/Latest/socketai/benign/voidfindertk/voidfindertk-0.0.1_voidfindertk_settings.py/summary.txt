  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration management module with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or adjustments are necessary."
