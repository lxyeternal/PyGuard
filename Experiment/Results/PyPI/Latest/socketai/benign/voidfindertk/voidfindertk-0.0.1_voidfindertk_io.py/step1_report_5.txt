{
  "purpose": "To read and process a table from a file or buffer and return a structured Box object containing positional and velocity data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a file or buffer via pandas.read_csv() with specified parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in pandas DataFrame; no direct sinks are present that process untrusted data beyond validation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the source (file/buffer) into pandas.read_csv(), then through validation steps, and finally into a box.Box object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and a local core module, defines a function to read a table, and processes data with standard pandas operations. It sets default parameters for reading CSV data, validates the number of columns, checks for null values, and removes duplicates before constructing and returning a box.Box object. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data-reading utility with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected data handling tasks safely and efficiently.",
