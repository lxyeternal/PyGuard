  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for void-finding algorithms, establishing a standard interface for preprocessing data, modeling, and building voids.",
  "sources": "Input data structure representing the box of tracers; class methods invoked during the find process.",
  "sinks": "Creation of Voids objects with data derived from abstract methods; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input 'box' -> preprocess() -> model_find() -> build_voids() -> Voids object construction.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in variable name 'procesed_box' instead of 'processed_box'; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with a 'find' method orchestrating three abstract methods. It contains a minor typo that could cause runtime errors if subclasses do not match method signatures. No external calls, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The class is intended for extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured abstract class with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only concern is the minor typo which should be corrected to prevent runtime issues. Overall, it poses negligible security risk.",
