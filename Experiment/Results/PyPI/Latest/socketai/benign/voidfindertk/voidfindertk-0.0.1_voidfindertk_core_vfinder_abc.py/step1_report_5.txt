{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for void search algorithms, providing an interface for preprocessing data, modeling, and building voids.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; class methods process input data passed to them.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; class methods do not perform external operations or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'find' method through 'preprocess', 'model_find', and 'build_voids' methods, returning a Voids object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard abstract class setup with method placeholders. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical abstract base class for a data processing pipeline. It defines method signatures but contains no implementation details or external operations. No malicious or suspicious activity appears, only standard class structure. The code is clean and adheres to common design patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign abstract class designed for void search algorithms. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no external communication. The primary purpose is to provide an interface for subclasses to implement specific algorithms.",
