{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for implementing void search algorithms in a data structure, providing an interface for preprocessing, model finding, and building voids.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; the code primarily defines class structure and methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is an abstract class without concrete data flow execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is well-structured, standard, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods that will be implemented in subclasses. It imports only standard and local modules, with no user input handling, network operations, or data leakage points. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The class serves as an interface for void search algorithms, ensuring structured extension without executing any suspicious behavior. The only operation is constructing Voids objects with passed data, which appears safe. Overall, the code is purely structural, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented abstract base class for void search algorithms, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data nor perform any potentially dangerous actions.",
