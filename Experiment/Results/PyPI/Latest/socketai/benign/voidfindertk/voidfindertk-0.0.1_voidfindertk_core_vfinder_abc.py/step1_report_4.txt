{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for finding voids in a data structure, providing an interface for preprocessing, model finding, and building voids.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input or data; class methods receive parameters and call other modules.",
  "sinks": "None directly writing or transmitting data; primarily class method calls and object creation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for void search, with clear method interfaces and documentation. It imports only standard and local modules. The find method processes input data and constructs a Voids object, but all operations are straightforward and rely on subclasses to implement specifics. No external data handling, network communication, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured abstraction layer with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract base class for a scientific data processing task, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any harmful behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
