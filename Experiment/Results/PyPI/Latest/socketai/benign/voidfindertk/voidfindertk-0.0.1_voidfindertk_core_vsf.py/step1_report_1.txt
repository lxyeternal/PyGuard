  "purpose": "Module for calculating the Void Size Function (VSF) in a simulation, involving histogram analysis of radii data related to cosmic voids.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters `radius`, `delta`, `box`, and class attributes such as `box.size()` and `box.x.unit`. Uses numpy for numerical operations.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations internally, outputs processed data (`log_of_radius`, `counts`, `delta`). No data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute histograms and density functions; data flows from input through calculations to output variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, obfuscated segments, or hidden functionalities. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or system modifications. Uses standard numpy operations for histogram and logarithmic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code computes histogram-based void size functions based on radii and box properties, with no external network or system modification calls. The imports and class references are straightforward. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments are present. The function performs calculations based solely on input data and internal numpy operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module without malicious intent. It securely processes input data to generate statistical measures related to cosmological voids. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
