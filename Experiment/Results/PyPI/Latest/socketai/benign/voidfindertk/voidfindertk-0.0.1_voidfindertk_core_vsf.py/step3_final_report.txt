  "purpose": "Module for calculating the Void Size Function (VSF) based on radii and simulation box properties, involving histogramming and density estimation.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays (radius), box object attributes (size, unit), and parameters delta, n_step1, n_step2, scale_1_num_samples, scale_2_num_samples.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file or network I/O; outputs are arrays of logarithmic radii and densities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and box attributes through calculations (volume, density, histograms) to output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific histogram and density calculations for astrophysical analysis. It calculates the volume, tracer density, constructs bin edges based on physical scaling, and computes the histogram of radii in log space. No external network, file I/O, or malicious code is present. The logic is consistent with typical scientific practices, and no anomalies or obfuscation are observed. The use of numpy and object attributes is straightforward and appropriate. The calculations are physically motivated and internally consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific module for astrophysical void analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs standard calculations and data processing, and the security and malware scores should remain at zero. The overall risk is minimal, aligned with the nature of scientific computation.",
