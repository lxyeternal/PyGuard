  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific module for astrophysical void analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs standard calculations and data processing, and the security and malware scores should remain at zero. The overall risk is minimal, aligned with the nature of scientific computation."
