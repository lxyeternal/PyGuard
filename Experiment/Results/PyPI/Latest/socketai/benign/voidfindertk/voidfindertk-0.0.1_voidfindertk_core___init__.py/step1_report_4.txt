{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a core part of the Void Finder Toolkit, likely used for astrophysical data analysis and visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .box, .plot_acc, .radius_finder, .vfinder_abc, and .voids.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and defines __all__, with no data flow or processing logic involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code structure is straightforward, with standard module import and export definitions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports several components from its package and defines the __all__ list for exports. It includes licensing and copyright comments, which are typical for open-source projects. No network calls, data processing, or input handling occurs here. The code is simple, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. Since the code is purely for module organization and does not execute any data or commands, it poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to organize and export components of the Void Finder Toolkit.",
