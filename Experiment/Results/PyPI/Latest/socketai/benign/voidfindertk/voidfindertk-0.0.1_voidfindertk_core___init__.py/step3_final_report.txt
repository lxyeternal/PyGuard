{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the core module initializer for the Void Finder Toolkit, importing internal modules and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.box, .plot_acc, .radius_finder, .vfinder_abc, .voids). No external data sources or user inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output points involving untrusted data; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization file that imports internal modules and declares the public API via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
