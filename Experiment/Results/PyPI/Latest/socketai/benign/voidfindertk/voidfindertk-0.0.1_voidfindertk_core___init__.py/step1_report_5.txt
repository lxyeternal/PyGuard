{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a core part of the Void Finder Toolkit, likely used for scientific or data analysis purposes related to void detection in datasets.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules (.box, .plot_acc, .radius_finder, .vfinder_abc, .voids). No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are evident in this snippet. No untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initializer, importing internal components and defining the public API via __all__. No security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is detected. The code structure is standard and unremarkable, focused on organizing module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to expose internal modules for external use and does not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
