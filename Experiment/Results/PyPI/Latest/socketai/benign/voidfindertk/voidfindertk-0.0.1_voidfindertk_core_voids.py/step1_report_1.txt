{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'Voids' class for analyzing voids in a particle system, providing methods for filtering, radius calculation, center finding, and correlation functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (attrs, numpy, internal modules like center_finder, plot_acc, vsf, radius_finder, and core/utils); reads class parameters (method, box, tracers_in_voids, centers, extra); accesses class properties and methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified. No untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data such as tracers, centers, and radius are processed within class methods. Data flows through filtering, calculation, and cleaning functions, but all operations are typical for data analysis. No untrusted data is injected into system commands or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured with proper use of external libraries and internal functions. No suspicious hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are detected. No malicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports external and internal modules necessary for particle and void analysis. The 'Voids' class manages void data, including filtering, radius calculations, and analysis functions. Methods utilize standard numerical and data filtering techniques, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or code injection. The code contains no dynamic execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical scientific analysis class for cosmological or particle simulation data.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard scientific analysis module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily performs data filtering, calculations, and analysis tasks, using well-known Python libraries and internal functions. No malicious signals or security issues are detected.",
