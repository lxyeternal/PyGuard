{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Voids' for managing and analyzing voids in a particle system, including methods for filtering, radius calculation, center finding, and correlation functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as attrs, numpy, and internal modules; reads input data via class parameters and method arguments; accesses properties like box, centers, tracers_in_voids.",
  "sinks": "Uses methods like effect_radius, void_size_function, and _cleaner which process data; no explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file I/O shown; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through methods like filter_by_index, effective_radius, and find_centers; no indications of untrusted data flow or external influence; internal data processing is standard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. Use of well-documented, standard scientific computing libraries (attrs, numpy). The code appears structurally normal, with no hidden code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class implementation for void analysis in particle systems. It employs standard practices, external module imports, and internal data handling. No suspicious patterns, malicious commands, or external network interactions are present. The code's design focuses on scientific computation without indications of sabotage or malware. All external calls are via explicit method parameters, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on trusted libraries and internal methods, and no malicious signals are detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
