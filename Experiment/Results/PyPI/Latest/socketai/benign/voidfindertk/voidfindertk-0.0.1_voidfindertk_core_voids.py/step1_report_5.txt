{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'Voids' to analyze and manage void regions in a particle system, including methods for filtering, radius calculation, cleaning, and correlation functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (attrs, numpy, local modules), class attributes (method, box, tracers_in_voids_, centers_, extra_), and methods that access or process these attributes.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate or process data, such as effective_radius, void_size_function, _cleaner, find_radius_and_clean, find_centers, void_galaxy_corr, which may handle untrusted data or perform computations based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., tracers, radius, centers) flows through methods for filtering, radius calculation, cleaning, and analysis functions; no network or system command flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and modular design suggests legitimate functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class for void analysis, with methods for filtering, radius estimation, cleaning, and statistical analysis. It imports standard and local modules, but does not contain any network, file system, or system command operations. No indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or covert channels are present. The code relies on external modules for core computations, which are presumed safe. Overall, the logic appears legitimate and aligned with typical scientific data analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data analysis tasks related to voids in particle systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, assuming dependencies are secure and trusted.",
