{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'Voids' to analyze and manage voids in a particle system, including methods for filtering, radius calculation, center finding, and correlation analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions (attrs, numpy, local modules), reads class parameters, method arguments, and external data via method calls.",
  "sinks": "Methods perform calculations and data filtering; no evidence of data leaks or external untrusted data sinks. No network operations, file writing, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., tracers, centers, radii) flow through methods for filtering, radius calculation, cleaning, and analysis functions; no untrusted data is observed to reach insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscation, hidden dynamic code execution, or misleading variables. The code appears well-structured for scientific computation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs geometric and statistical calculations related to voids in particle systems. It imports external modules and local utilities, defines a data class with multiple methods for filtering, radius estimation, and correlation. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. Methods utilize standard scientific libraries and local utility modules without suspicious patterns. No code appears to perform obfuscated or intentionally misleading operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a well-structured scientific analysis class with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It focuses on particle void analysis, employs safe data handling, and relies on external modules for computations. No malicious or sabotage indicators are detected.",
