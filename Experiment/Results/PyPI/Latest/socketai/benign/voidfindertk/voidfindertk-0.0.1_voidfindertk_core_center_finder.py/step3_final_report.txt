  "purpose": "Module to perform density-weighted center calculations for tracer particles within a periodic simulation box, used in cosmological or astrophysical analyses.",
  "sources": "Reads tracer positions from box.arr_.x, box.arr_.y, box.arr_.z; uses external utility get_grispy_grid_from_box for spatial indexing.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Extracts tracer coordinates -> builds spatial grid -> performs neighbor searches -> applies boundary corrections -> computes density-weighted centers -> parallelizes over voids.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; print statements for progress are benign; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific spatial analysis with neighbor searches, density estimation, and periodic boundary handling. It uses parallel processing via joblib threading, which is common in such computations. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is well-commented, straightforward, and domain-specific. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The print statements are for progress reporting and do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for calculating density-weighted centers in a periodic box. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its benign and domain-specific nature.",
