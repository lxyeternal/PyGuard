{
  "purpose": "This module calculates density-weighted centers of void regions based on tracer particles in a simulation box, using parallel processing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Imports from joblib, numpy, and voidfindertk.utils.box_to_grid; uses input parameters like box object, tracer indices, and tracer positions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond input parameters. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Tracer indices and tracer position arrays flow into _get_xyz_tracers_from_indx; tracer positions are processed by _single_center_search; results are combined and returned in center_calculator.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, performing standard numerical and parallel computations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads tracer positions and indices, processes them to compute centers via density estimates and periodic boundary handling. It uses parallel processing with joblib, but all functions operate locally on data. No network connections, file writes, or malicious functions are present. The calculations are consistent with physical modeling and do not exhibit suspicious behavior. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, performing computational geometry and data processing tasks typical of scientific simulations. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries appropriately.",
