  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern for integrating native build steps into Python packaging. It does not contain malicious code but introduces a potential supply chain risk if the makefile is malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.4 depending on environment trust."
