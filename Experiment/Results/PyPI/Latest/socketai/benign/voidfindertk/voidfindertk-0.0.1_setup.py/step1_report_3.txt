  "purpose": "Customize the build process to run 'make' in a specific directory before proceeding with the standard build.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"voidfindertk/zobov\") and subprocess.check_call(['make'], cwd=makefile_dir)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call(['make'], cwd=makefile_dir)",
  "flows": "Code reads the directory path, then executes 'make' in that directory as a subprocess during build",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; normal use of subprocess for build automation. Directory path is relative, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom build command that runs 'make' in a specific directory before executing the standard build process. It uses standard library functions to determine the path and execute a system command. No user input or external data sources are involved. The subprocess call is confined to a specific directory and does not involve untrusted input. The purpose appears to automate building external dependencies or components. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. The code does not access or leak data, nor does it perform network or system manipulations beyond invoking a make command.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build customization script that runs 'make' before building the Python package. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
