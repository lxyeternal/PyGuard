{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, setting metadata, importing internal modules, and defining exports for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports internal modules and sets metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package __init__.py-like script. It sets version info, imports internal modules, and defines __all__. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All security and malware assessments are based on the static, benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code aligns with standard package initialization practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
