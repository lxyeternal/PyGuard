  "purpose": "Initialization and metadata setup for the Voidfindertk project, including imports and exports.",
  "sources": "The module imports from relative packages: settings, core, and io, and reads no external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or external output are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are identifiable in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module initialization script with metadata, license info, imports, and export definitions. No external data inputs, no suspicious operations, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive actions are observed. The code is purely structural, setting up the package's public API and metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or security issues. It is a standard module setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security concerns.",
