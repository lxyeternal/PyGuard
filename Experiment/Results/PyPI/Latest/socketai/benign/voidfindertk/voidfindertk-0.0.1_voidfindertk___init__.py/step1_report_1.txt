  "purpose": "Initialization of the Voidfindertk library, setting up metadata, imports, and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: settings, core (Box, VoidFinderABC, Voids), io (read_table).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script. It imports internal components, sets metadata, and defines exported symbols. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The structure follows standard Python package conventions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the package's public API and metadata without performing any operations that could be harmful.",
