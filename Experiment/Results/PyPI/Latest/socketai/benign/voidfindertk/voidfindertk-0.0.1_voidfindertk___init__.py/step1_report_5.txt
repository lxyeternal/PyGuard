  "purpose": "Initializes the Voidfindertk package by importing modules and defining metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: settings, core (Box, VoidFinderABC, Voids), io (read_table).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or output; no user input or data handling in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only performs module imports and metadata setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard package initialization code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and sets package metadata, with no external data input, environment variable access, or network activity. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file, indicating a standard, benign setup. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code solely establishes module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs module imports and defines metadata without any suspicious activity or malicious code segments.",
