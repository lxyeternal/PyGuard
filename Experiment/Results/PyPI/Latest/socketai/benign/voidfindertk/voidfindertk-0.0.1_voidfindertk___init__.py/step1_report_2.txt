  "purpose": "Initialization and import setup for the Voidfindertk package, providing metadata and exporting key modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: settings, core (Box, VoidFinderABC, Voids), io (read_table). No external input sources or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing, network communication, or data leakage identified.",
  "flows": "N/A - code only performs static imports and exports; no data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward package setup with standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as a package initializer, setting version info, importing local modules, and defining __all__. No input reading, data processing, or external communication occurs. It adheres to standard Python module conventions with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected.",
