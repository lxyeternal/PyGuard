  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the reasonableness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP client for API interactions, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code performs typical request handling, validation, and error management. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling, validation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward HTTP client. The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Continues the pattern of a standard REST client, with validation and error handling, no malicious features.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo signs of malware or obfuscation. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to the broader scope or slightly more complex handling, but still justified given the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard REST client, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo concerns. The low risk score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar request/response handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is a typical HTTP client without any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is justified; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured REST client with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical request handling risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
