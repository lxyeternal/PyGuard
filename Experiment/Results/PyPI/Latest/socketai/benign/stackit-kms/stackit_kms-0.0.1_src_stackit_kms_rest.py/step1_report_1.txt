{
  "purpose": "This code provides a REST client for interacting with the StackIT Key Management Service API, handling HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'body', 'headers', 'post_params', and 'method'. It reads from the 'requests' library responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'requests.session.request' method (which executes HTTP requests) and JSON serialization of 'body'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the request method, which constructs and executes HTTP requests; responses are encapsulated in RESTResponse objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard request handling without obfuscation or unusual code structures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a HTTP client with customizable session and authorization, then constructs requests based on method and headers. It manages content types, serializes bodies, and handles request exceptions. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hidden data exfiltration or backdoors, are present. The logic follows standard request patterns. No dynamic code execution, malicious payloads, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard HTTP client for API interactions without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles request construction, serialization, and error handling, with no suspicious anomalies.",
