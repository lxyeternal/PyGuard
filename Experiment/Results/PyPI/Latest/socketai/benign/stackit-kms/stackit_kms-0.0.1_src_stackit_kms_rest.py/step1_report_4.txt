{
  "purpose": "This code implements a REST client for interacting with the STACKIT Key Management Service API, handling HTTP requests and responses with support for different content types and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided method, URL, headers, body, and post parameters for HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of HTTP requests with untrusted data, especially in the request body, headers, or URL parameters. The code handles JSON serialization and multipart data, but does not execute code or perform unsafe operations directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (method, headers, body, post_params) into HTTP request construction, with serialization and request execution. No evident untrusted data flow leading to malicious actions like code injection or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual logic. The code appears standard for a REST client, with proper error handling and request preparation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical REST client implementation, handling various HTTP methods and content types. It includes validation of HTTP methods, serialization of JSON bodies, handling multipart form data, and error handling for request exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. The use of external libraries is standard, and the logic follows expected patterns for an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a REST API client with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations, and all data flows appear benign and intended for normal API communication.",
