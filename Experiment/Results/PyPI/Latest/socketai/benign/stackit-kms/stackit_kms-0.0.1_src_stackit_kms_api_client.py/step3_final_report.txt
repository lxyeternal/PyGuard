{
  "purpose": "The code implements a generic API client for the OpenAPI specification, handling serialization, deserialization, HTTP requests, and file operations. It is designed for communication with a key management service.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for API requests, response data, files read from disk, headers, environment variables (implied), and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external servers, writing files to temporary locations, deserializing response data, and handling response headers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and response data into serialization/deserialization functions, network transmission, and file storage. Response data is decoded and converted into appropriate objects or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. File handling via tempfile and filename extraction from headers is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client library utilizing common libraries and safe practices. It manages request construction, response handling, and file operations without any signs of malicious activity. The absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity indicates a benign purpose. The response deserialization and request serialization follow typical patterns, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for API communication with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
