{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object model using Pydantic for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'raw_data' field, and potentially untrusted data could be assigned to 'headers', 'data', or 'raw_data'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'raw_data' (raw bytes that could be malicious if executed or processed insecurely), 'headers' (can contain untrusted metadata), and 'data' (deserialized data).",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., 'raw_data' or 'headers') could flow into deserialized 'data' if not properly validated, but as this code defines the data model, it relies on external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' could potentially allow unsafe types, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Pydantic model for API responses, with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw bytes. It uses standard practices for type enforcement and documentation. No code execution, network calls, or external data processing is performed within this snippet. The configuration allows arbitrary types, which could pose risks if untrusted types are assigned, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured data model without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model definition for API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' warrants cautious data handling elsewhere but does not constitute malicious activity.",
