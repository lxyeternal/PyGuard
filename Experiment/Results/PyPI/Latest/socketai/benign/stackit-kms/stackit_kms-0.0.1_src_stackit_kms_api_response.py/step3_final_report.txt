{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data, using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class fields: status_code, headers, data, raw_data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or processing; purely a data container without data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal assignment within the class; no external input/output or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' in model configuration could permit unexpected or unsafe types, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Pydantic model for API responses. It does not perform any data processing, external data access, or code execution. The only notable aspect is the configuration allowing arbitrary types, which could pose risks if misused but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data model for API responses with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' introduces a potential risk if external data is assigned maliciously, but within this isolated context, it does not constitute a security issue. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
