{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data structure for serialization/deserialization with type validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines a class and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or outputted directly, no handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a generic class 'ApiResponse' extending Pydantic's BaseModel, and specifies fields for status_code, headers, data, and raw_data. The class uses type hints and validation, and sets 'arbitrary_types_allowed' to True in model_config. No external input handling, network operations, or data processing is included, reducing risk of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data container without obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model for API responses with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and serves a common purpose in API handling.",
