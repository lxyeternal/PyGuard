{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model using Pydantic for type validation and data serialization.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading functions, environment variables, or external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no output functions, network calls, or data leaks present).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code purely defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard usage of Pydantic models with generic typing.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a generic API response class with strict type enforcement for status code, headers, raw data, and data payload. It uses Pydantic's BaseModel for validation, including the 'arbitrary_types_allowed' setting. No external data access, network activity, or dynamic execution present. The structure appears typical for a response modeling class, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API response data model with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
