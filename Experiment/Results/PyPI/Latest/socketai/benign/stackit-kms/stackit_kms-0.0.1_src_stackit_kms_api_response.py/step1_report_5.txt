{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model for serializing HTTP response data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of pydantic is standard for data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model for API responses with type safety, including status_code, headers, data, and raw_data. It uses TypeVar for generic data typing, which is a standard pattern. No external data sources are read, no data is sent to untrusted sinks, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The 'model_config' setting allows arbitrary types but does not pose security issues by itself. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model for API responses with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
