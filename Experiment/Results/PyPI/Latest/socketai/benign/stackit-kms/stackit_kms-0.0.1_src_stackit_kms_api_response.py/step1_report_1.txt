  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object for serializing HTTP responses with strict type enforcement.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not contain data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' set to True in model_config, which could permit unexpected or malicious types, but no direct malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Pydantic model for API responses, enforcing strict types for status code, raw data, and optional headers. No input handling, external data reading, or unsafe operations are present. The setting 'arbitrary_types_allowed' could theoretically allow injection of malicious types, but in this context, it merely permits flexibility and does not execute code or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model for API responses with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
