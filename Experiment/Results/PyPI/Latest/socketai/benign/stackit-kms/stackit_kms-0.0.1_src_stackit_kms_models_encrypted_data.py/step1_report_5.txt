  "purpose": "Defines a data model class for encrypted data, with serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input data from JSON strings and dictionaries used in from_json and from_dict methods.",
  "sinks": "Conversion to JSON and dict representations, but no untrusted data sinks such as network or file output present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (JSON/dict) into class instance creation and back into JSON/dict outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of pydantic for data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data model class built with pydantic, providing methods to serialize and deserialize encrypted data. It uses type validation and string formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or dangerous operations. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or unsafe data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured data model with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
