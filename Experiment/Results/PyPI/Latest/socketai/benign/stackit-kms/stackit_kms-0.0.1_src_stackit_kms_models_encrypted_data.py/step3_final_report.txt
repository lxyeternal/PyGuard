  "purpose": "A data model class for handling encrypted data with serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "The 'data' field which accepts encrypted data in bytes or string, used in to_json, from_json, to_dict, from_dict methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data outputs, network calls, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to 'data' field -> serialization methods convert to JSON/dict -> deserialization methods reconstruct object from JSON/dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external resource access detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pydantic data model for encrypted data, providing serialization/deserialization. It contains no network, file, or system commands, no obfuscation, and no secrets. All functions are standard for data handling. No anomalies or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose is purely data encapsulation, with no external interactions or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data container for encrypted data, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security scores are appropriately zero, and the code is safe for supply chain use.",
