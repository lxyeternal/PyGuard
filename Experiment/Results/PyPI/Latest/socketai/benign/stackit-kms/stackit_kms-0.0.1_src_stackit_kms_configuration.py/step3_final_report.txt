  "purpose": "Configuration class for managing API host URLs with environment variable support and URL template substitution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'STACKIT_REGION' and input parameters such as 'region', 'server_index', 'server_variables'.",
  "sinks": "URL string formatting and substitution, validation of variables, and returning constructed URLs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and input parameters influence URL templates; substitutions replace placeholders with validated values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Minor URL formatting concern due to concatenation but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration utility for constructing service URLs based on environment variables and user inputs. It performs validation to prevent invalid enum values and issues warnings about future deprecation of region specification methods. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The environment variable usage and URL template handling are standard practices. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The environment variable handling and URL templating are typical and do not pose security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
