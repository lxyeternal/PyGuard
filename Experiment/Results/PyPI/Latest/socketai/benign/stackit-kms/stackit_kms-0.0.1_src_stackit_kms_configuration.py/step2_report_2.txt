  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a configuration utility for constructing API host URLs, primarily based on environment variables and input parameters.\n- They emphasize that the code performs URL template replacement, validation of variables, and handles regional configuration.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or network activity is reported.\n- The environment variable `STACKIT_REGION` is used for configuration purposes, which is standard practice.\n- The code includes a warning about future changes in region specification, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** There are no bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious actions. The code is straightforward, with proper validation and error handling.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent:** None detected. The code only manages URL templates and environment variables.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not execute dynamic code, handle secrets, or perform unsafe operations.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the reports and the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard configuration logic without vulnerabilities.\n\n### Risk assessment justification:\n- The code's purpose is purely configuration management.\n- It reads environment variables and input parameters safely.\n- It performs validation and error handling properly.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The provided scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the code is safe and standard.\n- The consistent use of environment variables and URL templating is common in configuration code, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to environment variable usage and URL handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate configuration utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues or malicious behavior detected.  \n- Scores are justified and should not be changed.  \n- The code is safe, standard, and well-structured.",
