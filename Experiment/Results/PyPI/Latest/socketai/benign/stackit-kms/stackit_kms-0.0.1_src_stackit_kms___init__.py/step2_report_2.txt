  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the criteria for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard SDK setup script, primarily consisting of import statements, version info, and documentation comments.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate, typical for SDK initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the SDK for Stackit KMS, imports modules and models.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted input or output, no data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None, standard import statements.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, purely static setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.5 (assigned as a neutral, minimal risk SDK setup)\n\n**Assessment:** The score seems appropriate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, SDK initialization.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static imports, no data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None, code generated but benign.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, due to being auto-generated SDK code)\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup, imports, configuration.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data, static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** None, standard SDK boilerplate.\n- **Analysis:** No code execution or data handling, just static setup.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, standard SDK code)\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK documentation and imports.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Static import statements.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Typical SDK boilerplate, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no security concerns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup, imports.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None, standard boilerplate.\n- **Analysis:** No code execution, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.5) are acceptable given the nature of auto-generated SDK code, which generally poses minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it's auto-generated SDK code, the risk is very low but not zero if considering supply chain concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the low risk scores are justified. The code is a standard, safe SDK setup with no security issues detected.",
