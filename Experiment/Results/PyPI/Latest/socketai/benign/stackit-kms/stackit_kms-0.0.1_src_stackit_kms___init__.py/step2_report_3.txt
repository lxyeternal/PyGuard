  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements and metadata, with no data flow, input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Security implications:** Completely benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Not unreasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on auto-generated SDK setup, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no data leaks.\n- **Security implications:** Safe, standard SDK initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps considering minimal risk due to auto-generation). Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports and documentation only, no data processing.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard SDK setup, no code execution or data handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Identical pattern—import statements, no dynamic code or data flow.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), which seems to reflect minimal inherent risk in auto-generated SDK code, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module, with no dynamic behavior, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The risk scores are reasonable given the nature of the code—auto-generated SDK code is generally low risk, but the slight non-zero scores account for the minimal inherent risk in code generation artifacts.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard import statements)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, considering it's boilerplate SDK code with no active logic or data handling)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
