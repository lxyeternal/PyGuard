{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python SDK for interacting with the STACKIT Key Management Service API, importing necessary modules, models, and exceptions for managing cryptographic keys and related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from the 'stackit.kms' package, including API endpoints, models, and exception handling classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input; the code mainly performs static imports and documentation.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily setup and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The comments indicate code generation tools but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup that imports modules for a key management system. It includes licensing and version info, with no dynamic or network operations present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected. It solely sets up imports for later use in API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical auto-generated SDK initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It functions as a standard setup for a key management API client.",
