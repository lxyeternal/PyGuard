  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward SDK module with import statements, version info, and documentation. No data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since no issues detected). The report's risk score is 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on auto-generated SDK setup. No untrusted data sources or dynamic behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, as it's boilerplate code). The report assigns a risk of 0.1, which is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on SDK initialization, static imports, no data handling.\n- **Security assessment:** No suspicious activity or code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report's risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Boilerplate SDK setup, no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK import setup, no dynamic code, no untrusted data.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. No concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, given the static, import-only nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code snippets are typical SDK setup files, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are consistent with the content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard SDK setup)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no security issues.",
