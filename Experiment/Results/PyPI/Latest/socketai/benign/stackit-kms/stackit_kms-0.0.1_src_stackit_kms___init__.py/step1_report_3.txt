{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python SDK for interacting with the StackIT Key Management Service API, importing modules, models, and configurations necessary for API operations.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are present. External modules and files are imported, but these are standard SDK components and not sources of untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, network connections, or file systems directly from this code snippet. No untrusted data processing or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet, as it only contains import statements, docstrings, and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no obfuscated code, suspicious constructs, or hidden behaviors. It contains only imports, comments, and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information, imports various API modules, models, and exceptions related to the StackIT KMS SDK. It does not process, handle, or manipulate any data. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. All elements are static and intended for SDK setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is a typical SDK initialization file with no sensitive or suspicious activities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
