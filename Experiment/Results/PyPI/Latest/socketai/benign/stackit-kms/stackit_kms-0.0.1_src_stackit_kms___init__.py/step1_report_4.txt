  "purpose": "The code provides imports and documentation for a Python SDK related to the StackIT Key Management Service API, facilitating key management operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard library and third-party modules, as well as API documentation and class imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written to external sources or network connections.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code only imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. All imports and comments appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily boilerplate for an SDK, including licensing, documentation, and import statements for various models and API components. There is no code execution, dynamic evaluation, or untrusted data handling. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are present. The code structure is straightforward, with clear comments and standard import practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely consists of import statements and documentation for API models and classes, with no suspicious behavior.",
