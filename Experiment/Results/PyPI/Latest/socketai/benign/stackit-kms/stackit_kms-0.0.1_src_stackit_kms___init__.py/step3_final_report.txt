{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK setup module for the Stackit Key Management Service API, primarily consisting of import statements for API components, models, exceptions, and metadata such as version info and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and metadata; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward boilerplate generated from an OpenAPI specification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated SDK setup file containing only import statements and metadata. It does not execute any dynamic code, handle input, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK initialization module with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
