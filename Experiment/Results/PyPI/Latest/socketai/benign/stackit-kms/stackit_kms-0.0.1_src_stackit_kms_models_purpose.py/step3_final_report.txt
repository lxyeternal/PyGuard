  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration 'Purpose' for key usage types and provides a method 'from_json' to deserialize a JSON string into an enum instance.",
  "sources": "The 'from_json' method reads a JSON string input to create an enum instance.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' function processes the input JSON string; potential issues could arise if untrusted data is passed, leading to exceptions or malformed data.",
  "flows": "Input JSON string -> 'json.loads' -> Enum instance creation via 'from_json' method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'json.loads' in a simple enum class is somewhat unusual but acceptable; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward enum class with four string values representing key purposes. The 'from_json' method deserializes a JSON string into an enum instance using 'json.loads'. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file I/O. The use of 'json.loads' could be misused if untrusted data is passed, but this is standard in data deserialization routines. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1), acknowledging potential issues if untrusted input is used, but this is typical in such routines. The code is clear, auto-generated, and safe, with scores consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated enum class with a JSON deserialization method. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its characteristics.",
