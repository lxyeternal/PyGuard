  "purpose": "Defines an enum class for key purposes and a method to create instances from JSON strings, likely for API data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON strings via json.loads in the from_json class method.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads on input data; no other sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input JSON string -> json.loads -> Purpose enum instance",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only enum definitions and a straightforward JSON deserialization method; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple enum class with a method to instantiate from a JSON string, which is common for API data processing. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code appears clean, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It is focused on data structure definition for key purposes, with no external or network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, non-malicious, and safe. It serves as a data model for key purposes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
