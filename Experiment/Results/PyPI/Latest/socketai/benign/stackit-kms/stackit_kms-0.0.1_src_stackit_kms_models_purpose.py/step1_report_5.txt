  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for key purposes and a method to instantiate from JSON string.",
  "sources": "The import statements, the from_json class method receiving a JSON string.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of json.loads in from_json method, which could process untrusted JSON input.",
  "flows": "JSON input to from_json method, then to creation of an enum instance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; the from_json method only deserializes JSON to an enum instance.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an Enum class for key purposes with a straightforward from_json method. The json.loads call is a standard way to parse JSON strings. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection or unsafe data handling, are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of data modeling for an API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard enum definition with JSON deserialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
