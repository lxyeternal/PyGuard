  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides exception classes and utility functions for API error handling, with potential data flows into error messages and decoding response bodies.\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious code. The data flows involve untrusted data in error messages, but this is standard for debugging/logging and not inherently risky.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable, as error messages could leak sensitive info if logs are not handled carefully, but the code itself doesn't perform unsafe operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and generated.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for API errors, with no external interactions or data flows.\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is purely class definitions and functions for error handling, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — correct, no security concern.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard generated code, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes that process API response data, with potential for error message reflection.\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code handles untrusted data in error messages, but this is typical. No malicious code or data leaks are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — acceptable, given the potential for error message reflection, but overall low risk.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes and error message formatting, with potential reflection of untrusted data.\n- **Presence of Issues:** Similar to above, potential for reflected data in logs, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard exception handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes and error handling, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Presence of Issues:** No anomalies, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to potential reflection in error messages, but overall low and acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; the code is standard API error handling scaffolding.\n- The only minor concern is potential data leakage via error messages, but this is typical and manageable via logging practices.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, related to error message reflection, but generally safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, generated exception handling framework with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are appropriate.",
