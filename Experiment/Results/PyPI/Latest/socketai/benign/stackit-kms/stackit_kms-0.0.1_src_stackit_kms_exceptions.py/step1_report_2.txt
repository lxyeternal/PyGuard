  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling OpenAPI-related errors, with utilities for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily consists of class definitions and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard exception handling framework generated by an OpenAPI tool; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various HTTP error responses in an API context. It includes mechanisms for constructing detailed error messages, including request paths, and for raising specific exceptions based on HTTP status codes. No network communication, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. It functions as a supportive error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, generated API error handling framework with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities, and its purpose is to provide structured exception management for API responses.",
