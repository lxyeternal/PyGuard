  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is solely exception class definitions and utility functions; no operational or data-processing code is present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The report correctly notes that data flows are limited to error messages and response decoding, which are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature. Security risk is low (0.2), justified by potential data exposure if untrusted data is logged or displayed.\n- **Risk justification:** Since error messages may include untrusted data, there's a minor risk of information leakage, but no active malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** The report's conclusion that this is a benign, standard error handling scaffold is correct.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no operational code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; the code is purely structural.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is minimal.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is error handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code reads data from response objects and formats error messages, but nothing malicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; potential data leakage is limited to error message formatting.\n- **Overall:** Correct evaluation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, exception classes and error formatting.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just error handling.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is exception classes and a utility function, with no operational code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is minimal.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; data handling is limited to error reporting.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, generated code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2) due to potential information leakage if untrusted data is logged or displayed, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the nature of the code—standard exception classes and utility functions for error handling—**I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 (due to potential information leakage if error messages include untrusted data, but no active exploits or malicious code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk is justified by the potential for untrusted data to be reflected in logs or error messages, but this is a common and manageable concern in error handling code.",
