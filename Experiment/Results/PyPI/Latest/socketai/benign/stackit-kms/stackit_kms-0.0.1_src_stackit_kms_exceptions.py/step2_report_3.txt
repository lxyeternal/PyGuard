  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard exception classes for API error handling.\n- Data flow: From response objects into exception messages.\n- Potential sinks: String formatting and decoding response bodies.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The data is used for error messages, which is typical.\n- Risk score: 0.2 seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Malware score: 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for API errors.\n- Data flow: Structural, no external data or network activity.\n- Analysis: No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious code.\n- Scores: Risk 0, malware 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes, handling API response errors.\n- Data flow: From response objects into exception messages.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, just error handling.\n- Scores: Risk 0.1 is reasonable; malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent with the benign description.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes, error message formatting.\n- Data flow: From untrusted inputs into exception messages.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: Risk 0.2, malware 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for API error handling.\n- Data flow: From response objects into exception details.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: Risk 0, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign API error handling framework.\n- No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned (risk mostly between 0.1 and 0.2, malware 0) are reasonable.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily related to untrusted data in error messages, which is standard.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical generated exception handling module for an API client, with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
