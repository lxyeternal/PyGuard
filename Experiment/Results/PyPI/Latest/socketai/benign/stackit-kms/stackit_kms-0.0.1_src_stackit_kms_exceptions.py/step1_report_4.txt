{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling errors in an OpenAPI client implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception parameters (such as http_resp, body, data), and from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the __str__ method, which formats error messages; if untrusted data is passed as body or data, it could be reflected in logs or outputs.",
  "flows": "Exception constructors process and store untrusted inputs; __str__ method may output untrusted data, but no dangerous data flow from source to sink is evident beyond logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code strictly manages exceptions and error messages without external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for API error handling, with careful inclusion of attributes and message formatting. The render_path function constructs a string representation of error paths, which is used in exception messages. There are no evident data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The exception handling mechanisms do not process or transmit untrusted data outside of logging contexts. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The code's sole function is to handle and format errors based on API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of exception handling for an API client. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The potential for reflected issues is limited to error message formatting, which is benign and typical. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
