  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a set of exception classes and utility functions for error handling, with no active data processing or network activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the code's benign, error-handling purpose.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions are made about untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, purely structural exception classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly scored.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Standard error handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Exception classes that format error messages, potentially reflecting untrusted data in logs.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No actual malicious code or data leaks, just the possibility of reflected data in logs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2; acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to others, exception classes for API errors.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the code's benign error handling nature.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is a standard API error handling scaffold, generated or manually written, with no malicious intent.\n- The risk scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed; the scores are consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### My estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (aligning with the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the reported scores accurately reflect its nature.",
