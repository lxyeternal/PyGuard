  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and utility functions for handling API errors and responses in an OpenAPI client.",
  "sources": "Response objects' status, reason, data, and headers; error message formatting; decoding response bodies.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for error messages, decoding response data, raising exceptions based on HTTP status.",
  "flows": "Response data -> error message construction -> exception raising based on status code.",
  "anomalies": "Potential reflection of untrusted data in error messages, but this is standard for error handling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions and a render_path utility, with no active network activity or malicious code. Data flows involve standard error message construction, with potential minor information leakage if untrusted data is included in logs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, generated nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception handling framework for an OpenAPI client, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores accurately reflect its safe and straightforward purpose.",
