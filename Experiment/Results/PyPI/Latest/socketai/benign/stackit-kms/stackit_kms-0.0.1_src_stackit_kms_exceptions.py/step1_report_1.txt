{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling and rendering API-related errors, primarily for an OpenAPI client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from exception arguments (error messages, response objects), especially in the ApiException class constructor and from response objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting and decoding of response bodies, which could be exploited if untrusted data is used in error messages or logs.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from HTTP response objects (status, reason, body, headers, data) flows into exception construction and string representations, potentially exposing sensitive info if not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code relies on external response objects but does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a structured way to handle API errors via custom exceptions, with methods to render detailed error messages. The use of exception classes and response parsing appears standard. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Data decoding and string formatting are typical and do not pose immediate risks, provided the data is handled properly in consuming code. Overall, the code appears to be standard API error handling scaffolding with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes and utility functions for API error handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It handles untrusted data in a controlled manner, primarily for debugging and error reporting purposes.",
