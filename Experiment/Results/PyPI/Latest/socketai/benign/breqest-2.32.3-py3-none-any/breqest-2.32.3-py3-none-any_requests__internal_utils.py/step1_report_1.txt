{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports 're' module, uses 'compat.builtin_str', reads input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; functions return processed data or validate strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or checked for ASCII content; no external data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The functions are standard utility implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex-based validation for HTTP header names and values, with predefined patterns. It includes functions to convert arbitrary input to native strings and to verify if a Unicode string is ASCII-only. The use of 'compat.builtin_str' suggests cross-version compatibility handling. There are no network operations, no data leaks, or code injections. All functions are standard and do not perform unsafe operations or include obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard utility code for header validation and string handling within the Requests library. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
