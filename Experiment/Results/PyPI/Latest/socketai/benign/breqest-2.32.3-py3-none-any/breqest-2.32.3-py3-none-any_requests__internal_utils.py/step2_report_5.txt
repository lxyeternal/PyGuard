  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is purely utility functions for header validation and string conversion, with regex patterns for header name/value validation, and functions to convert to native strings and check ASCII content. No suspicious activity, no external data flow, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe string handling and validation, with no external communication or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.95 (reported as 0.95).  \n- **Concern:** The securityRisk score of 0.95 suggests high risk, but the analysis states no malicious behavior. This is inconsistent. Given the code's nature, the risk should be very low.  \n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be adjusted down to 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard utility functions, safe regex patterns, no external effects.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions, standard regex, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Concern:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but the analysis indicates no malicious activity.  \n- **Recommendation:** Given the functions' benign nature, the securityRisk should be closer to 0, perhaps 0.01 or 0, unless there's a specific reason for concern.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others—header validation and string handling, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The same as above; the risk score seems slightly elevated without justification.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports agree the code is standard utility code with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, except for reports 2, 4, and 5, which have slightly elevated scores (0.95 and 0.1). These seem inconsistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be very low, close to 0, since the code is straightforward utility functions with no security implications.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is standard, safe utility code.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- Slightly elevated security risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0.01           |\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with negligible security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and standard utility code. The scores should be adjusted accordingly, with the security risk near zero.",
