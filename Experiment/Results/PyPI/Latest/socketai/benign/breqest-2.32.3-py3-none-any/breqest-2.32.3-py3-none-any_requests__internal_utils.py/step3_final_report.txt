{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for header validation and string manipulation within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input strings to 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii' functions.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform internal processing without external data leaks or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or checked for ASCII compliance; no external data flow or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for validating HTTP headers, a function to convert any input to a native string with decoding, and a function to check if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters. All operations are standard, safe, and do not involve external communication or malicious behavior. The regex patterns are typical for header validation, and string handling is straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code used for header validation and string processing. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal decoding operation is safe within the context of the requests library. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.01).",
