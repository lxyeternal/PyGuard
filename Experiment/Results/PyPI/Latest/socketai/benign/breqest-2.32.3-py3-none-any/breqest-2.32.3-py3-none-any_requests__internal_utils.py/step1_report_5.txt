{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for validating headers and handling string encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameters 'string' and 'u_string' in functions 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "The 'decode' method in 'to_native_string' could potentially process untrusted data; the regex patterns could be used to validate or filter header names/values but do not directly process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into decoding or validation steps without evident external influence or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The regexes are standard for header validation; the use of 'decode' is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions: one converts various string types to a native string, decoding if necessary, and another checks if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters. The regex patterns define header name and value validation, which are standard and do not involve malicious behavior. The functions do not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious code is detected. The functions serve legitimate purposes within the requests library, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for header validation and string handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
