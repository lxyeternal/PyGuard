{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling string conversions and header validation in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports the 're' module and the 'builtin_str' from a local 'compat' module.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii' perform data conversions, but do not include data sinks that leak data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings) are processed within functions for type conversion and validation, with no external communication or execution based on untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward string validation and conversion. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and functions for string conversion and ASCII checking. It imports only standard modules and relies on a local 'compat' module for string type checks. The functions are safe, performing type checks and encoding conversions without external effects or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for string and header validation within the Requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates solely on internal data and does not perform any harmful actions.",
