{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and imports, mainly handling exceptions and error conditions within the library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily defines exception classes without handling user input or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code defines exception inheritance and constructors without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to follow standard Python exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions and defines custom exception classes for handling various network and request errors. The classes mostly inherit from base exceptions and do not process or execute any data or code that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The presence of exception handling is standard and does not pose security risks by itself. There are no suspicious patterns, unsafe code practices, or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a network request library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this module.",
