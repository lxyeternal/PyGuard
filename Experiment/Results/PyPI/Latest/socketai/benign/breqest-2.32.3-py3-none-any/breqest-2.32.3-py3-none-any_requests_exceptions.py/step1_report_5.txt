  "purpose": "Define exception classes for the requests library, handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat, class constructors, and methods defining exception behavior.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines exception classes with no embedded logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes and defines several custom exception classes for the requests library. These classes serve to categorize and handle different HTTP and network errors. The constructors and methods adhere to standard Python practices for exception classes. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and purely structural, with no obfuscated elements or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python HTTP library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to structure error handling and warnings, with no external data flows or suspicious features.",
