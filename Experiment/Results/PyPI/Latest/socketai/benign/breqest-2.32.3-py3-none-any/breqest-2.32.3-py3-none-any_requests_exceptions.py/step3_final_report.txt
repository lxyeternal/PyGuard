  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports exceptions from urllib3.exceptions and a compatibility module; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class definitions do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and imported exceptions. It contains no network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is standard, benign, and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
