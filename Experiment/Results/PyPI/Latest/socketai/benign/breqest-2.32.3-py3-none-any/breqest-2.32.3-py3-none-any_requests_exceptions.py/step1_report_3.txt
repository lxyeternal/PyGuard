  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data sources; only class definitions and imports).",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs, external calls, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "None (no execution flow involving untrusted data or external inputs).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with typical inheritance and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from urllib3 and a compatibility module, then defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Requests library, including various HTTP and connection errors, and warning classes. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, primarily defining exception classes for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python HTTP library and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious features.",
