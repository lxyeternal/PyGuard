{
  "purpose": "The code handles HTTP request preparation and response parsing within the Requests library, including URL encoding, header management, cookie handling, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL components, request data, headers, cookies, raw response streams, and JSON payloads.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, request headers, request body, response content, and cookies.",
  "flows": "User input or parameters flow into URL parsing, encoding functions, header setting, request body assembly, and response decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP request and response handling. It uses common libraries and practices, with proper error handling and encoding. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The data flows are typical for an HTTP client library, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free from malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and accurate given the code's functionality and structure.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
