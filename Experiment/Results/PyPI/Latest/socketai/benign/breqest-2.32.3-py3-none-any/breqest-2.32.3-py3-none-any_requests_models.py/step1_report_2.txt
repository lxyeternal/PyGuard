{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request parameters (method, url, headers, data, json, files, cookies, auth), and response data (raw response content, headers).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request headers, request body (including multipart/form-data), cookies, and response content; also URL and header manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request preparation methods (e.g., prepare_url, prepare_body, prepare_headers), transforming user input into request-ready format; response flows from raw raw response data into parsed content, text, and JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Use of potentially unsafe encoding conversions, but no malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration code is present. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known third-party utilities, with no unusual or unexpected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles request construction and response parsing, with thorough URL validation, header validation, encoding, and cookie management. It includes standard practices for request preparation, including JSON encoding, multipart form data, and cookie handling, as well as response handling with content decoding, JSON parsing, and error handling. There are no signs of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication outside normal request/response cycles, or backdoors. Security concerns are limited to standard safe practices. No code injection, unsafe eval, or malicious hooks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured part of the Requests library responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators. Its security risk score is low, with no evidence of malware. The code performs typical request/response processing tasks securely.",
