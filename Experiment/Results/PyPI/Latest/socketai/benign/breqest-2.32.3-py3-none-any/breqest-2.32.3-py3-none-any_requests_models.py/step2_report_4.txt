  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes request/response handling, URL, headers, cookies, raw streams.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows into encoding, headers, request bodies, and response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior, typical use of external libraries.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, due to general complexity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to report 1, focusing on request construction and response parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, well-structured code, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, slightly higher but justified by the overall complexity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; details request/response handling, encoding, URL, headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; untrusted data flows into encoding and request construction.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate, given the routine nature)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes typical request/response handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; data flows into encoding, headers, response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine, standard code, no malware indicators.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; focus on request construction, encoding, cookies, response.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; data flows into request preparation, headers, cookies, response decoding.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, secure handling of HTTP data.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the clear, readable code.\n- Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), appropriate for well-maintained, open-source HTTP handling code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 (no signs of malware)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent complexity but no security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's content. No adjustments needed.",
