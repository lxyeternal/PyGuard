  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reading request URLs, headers, and cookies; extracting cookies from responses; accessing and modifying cookies within a cookie jar.",
  "sinks": "Generating 'Cookie' headers for requests; modifying or removing cookies in the cookie jar; cookie creation and setting functions.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers are read in 'MockRequest'; cookies are extracted into the jar in 'extract_cookies_to_jar'; cookie headers are generated in 'get_cookie_header'; cookies are created/modified via 'create_cookie' and 'set'; cookies are removed via 'remove_cookie_by_name'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard use of cookie handling functions; no suspicious network activity or data leaks; code appears standard for cookie management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility wrappers for cookie handling in the requests library, including classes for mocking requests and responses, cookie extraction, and cookie jar manipulation. It uses standard Python modules and idioms, and methods are designed for managing cookies with no evident malicious behavior. The functions perform expected roles such as creating, extracting, updating, and deleting cookies. No code patterns indicate attempts at obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow. Overall, the code appears legitimate and aligns with common cookie management practices in HTTP clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for cookie management within HTTP requests, providing utility functions and classes with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. The code is consistent with legitimate use cases for cookies in the requests library.",
