  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, management, and conversion between formats.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, URL parsing, extracting cookies from response headers, and cookie data structures.",
  "sinks": "Sending cookie headers with requests, extracting cookies into CookieJar, modifying or deleting cookies, and creating cookies with potentially specified attributes.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to generate cookies; cookies are extracted from response headers into a CookieJar; cookies are accessed or modified via dict-like interfaces, including setting and deleting cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; no unusual URL or domain manipulations; use of standard cookie handling patterns; no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or network connections; code appears to implement standard cookie management functions with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for cookie handling in the requests library, including converting Morsel objects to cookies, managing cookie jars, and extracting cookies from responses. All functions follow standard patterns for cookie management and do not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The CookieJar implementation is extended for compatibility and convenience, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious injections. Overall, the code performs legitimate cookie handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility implementation for cookie management in the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
