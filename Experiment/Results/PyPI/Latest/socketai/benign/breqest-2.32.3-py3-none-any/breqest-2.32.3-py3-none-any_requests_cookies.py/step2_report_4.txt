  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and potential malicious indicators.\n\n**1. Code Presence and Functionality:**\n- All reports confirm that the code provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, manipulation, and compatibility wrappers.\n- The functions and classes operate on standard data structures, with no evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are reported or evident.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The code appears to be well-structured and consistent with standard cookie handling practices.\n- No logical errors or insecure patterns are apparent.\n- The functions handle typical cookie operations, with appropriate error handling and data validation.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, citing no malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard utility code with minimal inherent risks.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, these scores seem appropriate. The code is utility-focused, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**4. Potential Risks and Justifications:**\n- The only potential concern could be misuse or misconfiguration, but that is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- No indication of vulnerabilities like code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**5. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is legitimate, standard, and safe.\n- The high confidence scores (0.9 to 1) across reports support this.\n\n**6. My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, acknowledging minimal inherent risk but no malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports collectively indicate that this code is standard, utility-oriented, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
