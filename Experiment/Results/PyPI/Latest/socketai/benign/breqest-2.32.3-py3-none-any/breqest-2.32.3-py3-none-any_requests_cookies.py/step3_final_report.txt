{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for cookie management within the requests library, including extraction, creation, and manipulation of cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Request URL and headers, response headers (HTTPMessage), cookie parameters provided by user or external code.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar modifications, request headers (Cookie header), internal cookie storage.",
  "flows": "Request object provides URL and headers -> extraction functions parse response headers into cookie jar -> cookie jar functions read/write cookies -> get_cookie_header produces Cookie header for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard utility classes and functions for cookie handling, including MockRequest and MockResponse wrappers, cookie extraction, creation, and management functions. All data flows are within expected cookie operations. No network activity, no data leaks, no backdoors, and no obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical cookie management practices. No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management in the requests library. It contains no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The high confidence scores are justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
