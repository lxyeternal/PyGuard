{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'where' function outputs the path to the CA bundle; no direct untrusted input or sensitive data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' from certifi, and then prints the path; there are no flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi to determine the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. It then prints this path if executed as a standalone script. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, or network activity involved. The code is simple, standard, and aligns with common practices for handling CA certificates.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script that simply outputs the path to the default CA bundle used for SSL certificate verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
