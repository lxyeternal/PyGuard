{
  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import from certifi and the __main__ block that calls where() to print the path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potential data leaks; only prints a trusted package path.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing certifi.where, then printing its return value when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward usage, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from certifi to retrieve the trusted CA bundle path. It simply prints this path if run directly. No input reading, no data transmission, and no malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is to provide the CA bundle location for other applications or scripts, with no suspicious or malicious actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the trusted CA bundle from certifi. It performs a simple, safe operation without any malicious intent or security risks.",
