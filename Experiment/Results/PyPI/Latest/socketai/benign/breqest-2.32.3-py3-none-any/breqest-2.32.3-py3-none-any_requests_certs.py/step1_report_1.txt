  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the 'certifi' package; calling 'where()' in the main block to output the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> execute 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard function from a well-known, reputable package 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path. It then prints this path when executed directly. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or suspicious data flows. The code's purpose aligns with its implementation, and it relies on the trusted 'certifi' package. No external inputs, dangerous operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that outputs the CA bundle location from 'certifi'. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
