  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward script that imports `where` from the `certifi` package and prints its output.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, simple, and purpose-driven.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The purpose is to provide the CA bundle location, which is standard and safe.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n- The use of `certifi` is a well-established practice in Python SSL verification.\n- The code is minimal, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- `obfuscated`: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- `securityRisk`: All reports assign 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No issues are present; all analyses are consistent.\n- The purpose and implementation align correctly.\n- No reason to adjust scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility script with no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
