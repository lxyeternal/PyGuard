  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n\n- The code is a minimal script that imports `where` from `certifi` and prints its output when run directly.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are identified in the code itself.\n\n**2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code is benign, simple, and relies on a reputable package.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the summaries.\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n\n- No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is harmless.\n- The highest confidence is noted (1), and all assessments point to no security risk.\n\n**5. Challenge claims based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign because it only prints a package-provided path.\n- This is justified; there's no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- No assumptions seem unfounded.\n\n**6. Ensure score consistency:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scoring are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple utility script that outputs the CA bundle path from a trusted library (`certifi`). It does not process untrusted input, does not perform network operations, and contains no malicious or suspicious logic. All evidence points to a benign, informational utility.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** No issues or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; all zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n- **Confidence:** High (1), as all reports agree.\n- **Final recommendation:** No security concerns. The code is safe and benign.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
