{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location used for SSL/TLS verification in the requests library, primarily for packaging or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package by importing the 'where' function to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source 'where()' function provides the CA bundle location, which is then printed out; this flow is informational and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, does not handle user input, does not include hidden or obfuscated logic, and simply outputs a package-defined value.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package, which is a standard and reputable library for SSL certificate verification. The main block prints the path to the CA bundle. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is minimal and purpose-driven, intended for retrieving and displaying the CA bundle path, which is a normal operation in Python SSL-related utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for retrieving and displaying the default CA certificate bundle location. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
