  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from 'certifi' and calling it to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data sources or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from 'certifi' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal utility that imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It involves no external input, network activity, or data processing. The purpose is purely informational, and all signals indicate benign intent. The code's simplicity and reliance on a reputable package minimize security concerns. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, benign utility for retrieving the CA bundle path. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
