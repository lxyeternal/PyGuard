{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and dependencies, specifically related to HTTP requests, character detection, and data serialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from 'urllib3', imports optional modules ('chardet', 'simplejson'), and detects Python version info from 'sys'. It also imports various standard library modules related to URL parsing, cookies, and data handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, but the module could potentially process untrusted data via imports or version detection functions. No functions directly expose untrusted input or write data externally.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves detecting module versions, importing optional modules, and setting compatibility flags. There are no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code mainly focuses on compatibility and imports with standard library modules.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs environment detection and import resolution for compatibility, including handling Python 2 and 3 differences, optional module imports, and version checks for 'urllib3'. It carefully handles ImportError and TypeError exceptions, indicating robust design. No dangerous or malicious code patterns are evident. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted input, nor does it contain code that could lead to data leakage or remote code execution. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for environment detection and safe importing, with no apparent malicious intent or dangerous operations.",
