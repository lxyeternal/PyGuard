{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing package imports and version checks for third-party libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party libraries (urllib3, simplejson), and dynamic import resolution for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks for untrusted input; no network or data leakage points; no external data handling or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs import operations, version checks, and assigns compatibility variables without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and intended for compatibility management.",
  "analysis": "The code handles version detection, conditional imports, and compatibility functions typical of a library aiming for cross-version support. There are no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. It includes safe import patterns, version parsing, and fallback mechanisms. All operations are standard, with no network connections, data leaks, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility module without malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import management and version detection with no suspicious behavior.",
