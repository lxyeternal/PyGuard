{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for Python 2 and 3, and handles imports for various libraries such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, and others related to URL parsing and cookies.",
  "sources": "Import statements and dynamic module imports (importlib.import_module, import of simplejson, urllib3 version, sys.version_info, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes modules and variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code performs standard compatibility and import resolution tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python package setup functions, including handling differences between Python versions, dynamically importing modules, and setting up compatibility variables. It includes version checks, optional import handling for third-party libraries, and defining compatibility aliases. There are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern could be dynamic imports, but these are contextually normal in compatibility modules and do not involve untrusted data. Overall, the code appears to be standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a compatibility and import utility module without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs expected setup functions typical for such a module. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
