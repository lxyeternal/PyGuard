  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a compatibility module handling imports and version detection with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward use of standard libraries and safe dynamic imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard compatibility functions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no malicious code, exception handling is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility setup, version detection, safe imports, no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No dangerous patterns, no external data processing, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and import management, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Standard safe patterns, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility layer, safe imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The actual code provided matches the descriptions; it is a standard compatibility module.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No indicators of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** No external data handling, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential for Risk:** The only consideration might be dynamic imports, but in this context, they are safe and standard for compatibility modules.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard compatibility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
