{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including version detection, safe import resolution, and environment handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info retrieval, dynamic import attempts for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Version info and import resolution flow through internal variables; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility setup, including version detection, safe import fallback, and environment handling. It uses exception handling for optional modules and defines type aliases for cross-version compatibility. No external data is processed or transmitted, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The dynamic imports are standard for such modules and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured compatibility utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports align in indicating a safe, standard implementation.",
