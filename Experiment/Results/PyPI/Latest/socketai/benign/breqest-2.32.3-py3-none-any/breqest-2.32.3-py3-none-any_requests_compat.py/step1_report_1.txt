{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility and utility functions for HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version differences.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, dynamic module import for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code performs standard compatibility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with importing modules and handling compatibility issues across Python versions. It dynamically imports character detection libraries, manages JSON parsing fallback, and sets up type definitions. All operations use safe, standard library functions and well-known third-party modules. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to best practices for compatibility without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe imports and setup functions typical for such utility modules.",
