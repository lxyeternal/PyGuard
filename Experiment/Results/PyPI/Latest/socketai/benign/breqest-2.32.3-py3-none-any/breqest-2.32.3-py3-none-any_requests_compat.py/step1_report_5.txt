{
  "purpose": "This module handles backward compatibility and imports for various Python versions and libraries, including URL handling, character detection, and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, json, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic import of character detection libraries (chardet, charset_normalizer).",
  "sinks": "None of the imports or functions directly execute untrusted data or perform sensitive data operations. No network or file write/read operations are performed within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, primarily imports and setup functions without data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. The code appears to be standard compatibility and import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility issues across Python 2 and 3, imports optional modules (simplejson, chardet/charset_normalizer), and defines version-specific flags. It uses safe import patterns with exception handling. No data is processed, leaked, or manipulated insecurely. No network calls, command execution, or data storage operations are evident. The code's structure is typical for a compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or security risks. It is safe based on this analysis.",
