  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles compatibility, dynamic imports, version detection, and sets up type aliases. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. All operations are standard for compatibility modules, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import handling, version detection, and compatibility setup. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is typical for such modules, with safe import patterns and no data flow issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment detection, import resolution, and version checks, with no data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and correct. All operations are standard, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe import patterns, version detection, and compatibility setup.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a compatibility layer with safe import handling, no data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code performs safe, standard compatibility functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious intent, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-implemented, standard compatibility module. All reports are consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
