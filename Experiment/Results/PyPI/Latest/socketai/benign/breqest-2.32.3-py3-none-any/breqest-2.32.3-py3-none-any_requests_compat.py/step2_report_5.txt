  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code handles compatibility, imports, and version detection, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It notes safe standard library usage and dynamic imports for character detection libraries.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed performs compatibility functions, with safe import patterns, version checks, and no data processing or external outputs. The conclusion that there's no malware or security risk is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** The assigned malware (0), obfuscated (0), and securityRisk (0) are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard compatibility utilities, safe imports, and no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's operations are typical for such modules. No signs of malicious activity, and dynamic imports are contextually safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), obfuscated (0), securityRisk (0) are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code handles environment detection, module imports, and version checks without processing untrusted data or performing external operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with exception handling for imports, no data leaks, or network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), obfuscated (0), securityRisk (0) are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on compatibility, safe imports, and version detection, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. All operations are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), obfuscated (0), securityRisk (0).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights compatibility handling, safe imports, no data leaks, and no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), obfuscated (0), securityRisk (0).\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2/3 support, managing imports, version detection, and optional character detection libraries. It uses safe patterns, exception handling, and avoids any external data processing or network activity.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-driven.\n\n- **Security Risks:** No evident security risks. It doesn't handle untrusted data, execute external commands, or perform network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** as well, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe compatibility utility with no malicious or suspicious features.",
