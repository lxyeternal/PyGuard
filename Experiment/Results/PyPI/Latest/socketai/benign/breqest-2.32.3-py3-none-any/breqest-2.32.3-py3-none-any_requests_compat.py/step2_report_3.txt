  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard compatibility and utility module.\n- They highlight safe import patterns, environment detection, and version handling.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.\n- The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's behavior:\n- The code only performs module imports, version detection, and compatibility flag setting.\n- No execution of untrusted data, no network calls, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Dynamic imports are standard in compatibility modules and do not introduce malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as a compatibility utility.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's operations.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- The reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Dynamic imports could, in theory, be exploited if untrusted modules are introduced, but here they are standard libraries or well-known third-party modules.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### My own evaluation:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive reviews provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical compatibility utility module, safe and well-understood, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores provided are appropriate and justified.",
