  "purpose": "Declare metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and other attributes.",
  "sources": "Attribute assignments at the beginning of the code (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains ASCII art comments at the beginning, which are benign and do not impact execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration typical of a Python package's __init__.py or metadata file. It includes descriptive attributes about the package 'requests' and does not perform any data input, output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The ASCII art is decorative and non-functional. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies related to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration with benign ASCII art. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
