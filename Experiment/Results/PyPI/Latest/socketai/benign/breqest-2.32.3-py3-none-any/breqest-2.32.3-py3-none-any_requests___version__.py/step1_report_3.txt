  "purpose": "Define metadata variables for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and related info.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, output, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely assigns metadata string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets various metadata variables describing the 'requests' package. All variables are assigned static strings or numeric literals. No user input, network operations, or file I/O are involved. The content is purely informational and standard for Python package modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious instructions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical metadata declaration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no sources or sinks that could be exploited. The code appears benign and is standard practice for package description modules.",
