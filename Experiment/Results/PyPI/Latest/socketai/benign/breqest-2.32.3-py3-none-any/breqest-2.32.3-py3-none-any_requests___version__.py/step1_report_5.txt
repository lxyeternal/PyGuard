{
  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only assigns string and integer values to metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; the code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; all code is straightforward variable assignments with static values.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments storing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative emojis. No external data input, no network communication, and no executable logic or dynamic code. The comments are ASCII art and do not influence code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless metadata declaration for the 'requests' package with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard header file with no suspicious elements.",
