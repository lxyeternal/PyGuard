  "flows": "N/A – No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comment; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata definitions for the package, including string assignments for descriptive attributes and versioning. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The ASCII art comment is purely decorative. The metadata aligns with standard package information and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and intended solely for documentation purposes within the package.",
