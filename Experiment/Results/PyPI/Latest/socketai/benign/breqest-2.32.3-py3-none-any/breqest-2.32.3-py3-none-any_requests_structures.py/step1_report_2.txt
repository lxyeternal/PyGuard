  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary and a simple lookup dictionary used in requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__, get), and updates (__setitem__, update).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; data structures mainly handle internal data storage and access.",
  "flows": "Data flows through method calls such as __setitem__, __getitem__, and update, with internal storage in self._store or self.__dict__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. The former manages header-like data with case-insensitive keys, storing original case. The latter is a simple dictionary with an optional name attribute, primarily for lookup purposes. Both classes use standard Python data structures and methods, with no indications of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it process untrusted input in a manner that could cause harm or leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data structures used for request headers and lookup functionality. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. The code appears safe and benign.",
