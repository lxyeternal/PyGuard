  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data for the constructors of CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, and dictionary item access and update methods.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary operations such as __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, and update methods which could be exploited if malicious data manipulates dict behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the constructors and update methods, which then populate internal storage; data retrieval occurs via __getitem__, get, or iteration methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. The code relies on standard Python data structures and typical method implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, both subclasses of dict or MutableMapping. CaseInsensitiveDict stores keys in lowercase for case-insensitive access but preserves the original case for iteration and representation. It uses an internal OrderedDict to store the data. LookupDict is a simple extension of dict, with a custom __repr__ method. The implementations use standard Python idioms without any dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code only manipulates in-memory data structures, typical for such utility classes, with no external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. The implementation appears clean, safe, and intended solely for data handling.",
