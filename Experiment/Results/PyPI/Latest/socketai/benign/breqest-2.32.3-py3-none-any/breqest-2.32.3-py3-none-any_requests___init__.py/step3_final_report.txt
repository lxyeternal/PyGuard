{
  "purpose": "The code manages dependencies, performs version checks, and configures SSL fallback for the requests library, ensuring environment compatibility and suppressing non-critical warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports of version info from urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer; environment checks; SSL import and fallback; warning filters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; primarily version assertions, warnings, and environment configuration.",
  "flows": "Version info and environment checks flow into assertions and warnings; SSL fallback may involve external modules but no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of DependencyWarning and FileModeWarning; standard in library setup but could hide legitimate issues if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency validation, version assertions, SSL fallback via pyopenssl, and warning configuration. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The suppression of warnings is typical in library code to reduce log noise. The version checks and environment setup are standard practices. No data flows from untrusted sources or malicious payloads are detected. The overall structure is clear, and the purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup routine for the requests library, focusing on dependency validation and environment configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by warning suppression but typical in such context.",
