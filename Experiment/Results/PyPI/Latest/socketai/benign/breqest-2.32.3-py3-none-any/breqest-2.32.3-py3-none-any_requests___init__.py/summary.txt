  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup routine for the requests library, focusing on dependency validation and environment configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by warning suppression but typical in such context."
