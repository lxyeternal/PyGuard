  "purpose": "Screen capture, object detection via SpinDetector, and automated mouse clicking for automation purposes.",
  "sources": "Screen region via mss, detection results from SpinDetector, optional display via cv2, mouse control via pyautogui.",
  "sinks": "pyautogui (mouse movement and click), cv2 (display window). No external network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Screen capture (source) → detection (source) → decision to click (sink) → pyautogui.moveTo and click (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected. Exception handling is broad but typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard automation tasks: capturing screen frames, detecting objects, optionally displaying results, and controlling the mouse. No malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. Use of pyautogui is controlled and optional. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The broad exception handling in _maybe_click is typical for such scripts but does not introduce security issues. The potential for misuse exists due to automation capabilities but is not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign automation script for detection and auto-clicking, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of automation features, but the code itself is safe.",
