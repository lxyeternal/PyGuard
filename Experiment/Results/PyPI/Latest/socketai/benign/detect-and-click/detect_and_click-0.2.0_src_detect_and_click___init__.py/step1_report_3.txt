{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that provides functionality for detecting objects on the screen and automatically clicking on them, as part of a screen automation library.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from its own package: 'detector' and 'clicker' which likely contain core logic and implementation details.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely occurs from imported modules (detector and clicker) executing their detection and clicking functions, but no direct source-to-sink flow is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and contains only import statements and module metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module declaration with imports of 'SpinDetector' and 'DetectAndClick' classes/functions, and an __all__ declaration for exports. It does not perform any operations itself, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are observable in this minimal code fragment. The imported components could contain sensitive operations, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a screen object detection and clicking library. It contains no suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The security risk is very low, but a full review of the imported modules would be necessary for a complete security assessment.",
