  "purpose": "Export modules for object detection and automated clicking functionality in a screen automation library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'detector' and 'clicker'. No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only module imports and symbol exports occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components from local modules and exposes them via __all__, defining the package's public API. No user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The package version is specified as 0.2.0. Overall, the code serves as a module initializer without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module that exports specific functionalities related to object detection and clicking automation. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
