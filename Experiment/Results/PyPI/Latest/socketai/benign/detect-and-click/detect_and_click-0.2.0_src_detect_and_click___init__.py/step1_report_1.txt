  "purpose": "To provide a library for detecting objects on the screen and automatically clicking on them.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing SpinDetector and DetectAndClick modules from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no code execution or data leakage points visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs; straightforward module export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes or functions from local modules and defines the module's public interface and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a simple package initializer or module aggregation script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module entry point with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely exposes components for object detection and clicking automation without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
