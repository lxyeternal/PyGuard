  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'detector' and 'clicker'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exposes components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two classes from local files and exports them via __all__. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any operations besides defining module metadata and import/export statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a library setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports classes for external use.",
