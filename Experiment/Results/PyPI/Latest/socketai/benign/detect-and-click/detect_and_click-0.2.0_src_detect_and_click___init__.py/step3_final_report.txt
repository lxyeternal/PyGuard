{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a screen automation library, importing core classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from .detector and .clicker modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statements as sources; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. It contains no network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The security posture relies on the imported modules, which are not visible here, but the snippet itself is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious or security issues evident. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
