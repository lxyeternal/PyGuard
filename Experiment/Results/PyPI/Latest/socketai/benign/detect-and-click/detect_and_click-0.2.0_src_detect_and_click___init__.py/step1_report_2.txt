  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components for a screen object detection and automatic clicking library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'detector' and 'clicker' within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis needed as code only imports and defines __all__ and __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes or functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It also sets a version string. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package interface with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
