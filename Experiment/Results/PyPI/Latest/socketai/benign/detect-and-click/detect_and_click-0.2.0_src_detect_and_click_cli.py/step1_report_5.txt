  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the detect_and_click module, facilitating user input and running the detection and clicking process.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments: --model, --conf, --delay, --no-display, --region",
  "sinks": "Passing parameters to the DetectAndClick class and its run method; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident",
  "flows": "User input → command line argument parsing → parameter validation → passing parameters to DetectAndClick → execution of dac.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command line arguments, validates the region string format, and passes parameters to the DetectAndClick class, which is imported from a third-party module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code mainly manages user input and configuration for detection and clicking operations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward command-line interface wrapper with no apparent malicious or security-compromising elements. It functions as an interface for a detection and clicking tool without suspicious behavior or security risks.",
