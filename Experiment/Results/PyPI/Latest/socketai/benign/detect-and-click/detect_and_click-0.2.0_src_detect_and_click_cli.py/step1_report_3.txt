  "purpose": "Command-line interface wrapper for detect-and-click automation tool that likely performs image detection and automated clicking within specified regions.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments: --model, --conf, --delay, --no-display, --region",
  "sinks": "Passing parameters to DetectAndClick class; no evident data sinks that leak data externally or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parsed and processed -> passed to DetectAndClick.run() method",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs standard argument parsing and object initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI for an automation tool. It parses user inputs safely, handles errors in region formatting, and initializes a detection-and-clicking object. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of 'detect_and_click.clicker.DetectAndClick', but within this code snippet, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure, standard CLI wrapper for an automation tool. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. Its design is straightforward and safe based on provided content.",
