  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for detect-and-click functionality, parsing user arguments and invoking external detection and clicking logic.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--model, --conf, --delay, --no-display, --region), region string input",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data flows into system or network operations within this code",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> argument parsing -> region string split -> region dict -> DetectAndClick.run() method",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument handling and delegation to external class",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI interface that processes user inputs, validates the region parameter, and calls an external class method. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The core functionality depends on the external class 'DetectAndClick', which is not provided but assumed safe. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation occurs within this snippet. The argument parsing and error handling are standard, and no secrets or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, primarily depending on the safety of the external class. The code itself is a minimal, straightforward CLI wrapper with no security concerns.",
