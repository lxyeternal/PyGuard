{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to detect spins using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and perform image processing tasks such as capturing and analyzing screen frames.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (ENV_VAR), model file paths, and input frames (np.ndarray).",
  "sinks": "Uses the YOLO model to process image frames; no apparent direct sinks for untrusted data beyond model inference.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or user-specified model path → model loading → detection from frames → output detection results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard model loading and detection logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by resolving a model weight file from various locations, including environment variables and predefined directories. It utilizes the ultralytics YOLO library for object detection and MSS for screen resolution detection. The class provides a method to perform detection on image frames, returning confidence and location data. The process relies on well-known libraries and standard practices; there are no obfuscated segments, suspicious network activity, or hidden functionalities. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The code seems to be part of a legitimate detection system with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs standard detection tasks using open-source libraries and safe methods. No malware indicators or security risks are present.",
