  "purpose": "Detection of spins using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, with model path resolution from environment variables, user input, or default directories.",
  "sources": "Model weights loaded from specified path, environment variable, or default directories.",
  "sinks": "Detection results returned as dictionaries; no external data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Model path resolution -> model loading -> frame inference -> detection output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a YOLOv8-based detection class. It handles model path resolution securely, performs inference on input frames, and returns detection data with confidence and coordinates. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses well-known libraries and follows best practices, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The environment variable and directory checks are standard and safe. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign detection utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, reflecting minimal standard risk due to environment variable usage but no actual vulnerabilities.",
