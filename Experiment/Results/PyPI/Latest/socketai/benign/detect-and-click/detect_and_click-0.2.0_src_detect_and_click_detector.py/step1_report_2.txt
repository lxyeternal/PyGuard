{
  "purpose": "The code implements a SpinDetector class that uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect spins in video frames, primarily for visual detection purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getenv), loads model weights from file paths, and accepts input frames as numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input frames and outputs detection results; no clear sink of untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions is apparent.",
  "flows": "Input frame -> model inference -> detection result -> return detection info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries for image processing and model inference.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for object detection using a YOLO model. It resolves model weight paths via environment variables, user input, or default directories. The detect_from_frame method processes frames and returns confidence and coordinates for the most confident detection. No code injection, malicious network activity, or privacy leaks are present. The code is structured and uses standard libraries with no obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and focused solely on detecting spins via a pre-trained model. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It is a standard implementation of a detection pipeline with no evident malware or security risks.",
