  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a detection utility using Ultralytics YOLOv8.\n- It loads models from environment variables, user-specified paths, or default directories.\n- It processes image frames and returns detection info.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- All reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Review:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are apparent in the code.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and simplicity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the absence of external data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Functionality:** The code's logic and flow are standard, with proper error handling for model loading.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Model loading:** Resolved securely via environment variables, user input, or default directories.\n- **Detection logic:** Uses max confidence detection, straightforward and safe.\n- **External dependencies:** Ultralytics, mss, cv2, numpy — all reputable open-source libraries.\n- **No suspicious patterns:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0, given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to environment variable reliance and file access, but nothing concerning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured detection utility with no security issues or malware indicators. The scores in the reports are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate; no changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
