{
  "purpose": "Unit test for the SpinDetector class's detect_from_frame method, specifically testing behavior without actual weights.",
  "sources": "The code reads the temporary file dummy (created as an empty file) for the model path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The test creates a dummy file, initializes SpinDetector with it, and processes a zeroed image frame; data flows from dummy file creation through detector initialization to detection method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The dummy weight file creation is standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test. It imports necessary libraries, creates a dummy weight file, initializes a detector instance with that file, and runs detection on a blank image. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The file creation with dummy data is a common testing pattern. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test intended for verifying detector behavior with a non-existent model file. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
