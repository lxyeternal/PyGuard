  "purpose": "Unit test for SpinDetector with dummy model file",
  "sources": "Dummy model file creation, import statements, detection method call",
  "sinks": "Detection output, no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Dummy file creation -> SpinDetector initialization -> detect_from_frame -> output assertion",
  "anomalies": "Creation of dummy file as model placeholder, no actual model loading or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, straightforward unit test that creates a dummy file to simulate model weights, initializes SpinDetector with this dummy path, and runs detection on a blank image. No network, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. The dummy file is a standard testing pattern, and the code uses common libraries. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test with no malicious or security risks. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
