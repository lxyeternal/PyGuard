  "purpose": "Unit test for the SpinDetector class to verify behavior when no model weights are loaded",
  "sources": "File input: temporary path where dummy weight file is created; numpy array representing image frame",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Input dummy weight file and image data flow into SpinDetector detection method, with no external data exfiltration or malicious command execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a straightforward test setup with dummy data",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a temporary dummy file to simulate model weights, initializes SpinDetector with this dummy path, creates a black image frame, and runs detection. There are no suspicious or malicious operations such as network calls, credential handling, or code execution. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple unit test for SpinDetector with dummy data. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security issues.",
