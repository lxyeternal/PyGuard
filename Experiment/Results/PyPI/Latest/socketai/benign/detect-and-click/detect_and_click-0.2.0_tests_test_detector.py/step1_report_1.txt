{
  "purpose": "Unit test for the SpinDetector class, checking behavior with dummy weights",
  "sources": "The code reads a temporary file to simulate model weights; numpy library is used for creating input frames",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; detection output is returned but not used maliciously",
  "flows": "The dummy weight file is created and passed as input to SpinDetector; detection function processes a zeroed image",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed; simple test code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a detector class, creates a dummy weight file to simulate model loading, and runs detection on a blank image. It performs a typical unit test without any network, system, or secret handling. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward test case for a computer vision model.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply verifies the detector behavior with a dummy file.",
