  "purpose": "Unit tests for MemoryGraph and MemoryNode classes to verify adding, retrieving, searching, saving, and loading nodes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; test data is hardcoded within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data flows are limited to internal object manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test functions that instantiate MemoryGraph and MemoryNode objects, perform add, search, save, and load operations, and verify expected outcomes via assertions. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could lead to security issues. The code solely tests the functionalities of the classes and methods, with no signs of malicious behavior or code injection. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard unit tests for in-memory data structures with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated content. It does not perform any dangerous operations or handle untrusted data.",
