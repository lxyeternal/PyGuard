{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the MemoryGraph and MemoryNode classes, testing node addition, retrieval, search by tag, and JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for node attributes, and reads/writes JSON files for saving/loading graph state.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (saving and loading JSON files) are potential sinks, but used in a controlled test context. No untrusted input processing or network communication present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from creating nodes, adding to the graph, saving to JSON, then loading from JSON and retrieving nodes, all within test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard library features safely.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical unit testing for data structures, utilizing class methods for adding, searching, saving, and loading data. File I/O is constrained to temporary paths. There are no inputs from untrusted sources or network operations. The data processed are static strings for testing purposes, with no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for data management classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely exercises core functionality without any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
