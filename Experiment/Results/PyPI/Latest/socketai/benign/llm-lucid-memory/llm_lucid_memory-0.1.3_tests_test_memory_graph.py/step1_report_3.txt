{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the MemoryGraph and MemoryNode classes, testing add, retrieve, search, save, and load functionalities.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is hardcoded within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A — data flows are internal and controlled within test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test functions that instantiate MemoryGraph and MemoryNode objects, perform operations like adding nodes, searching by tags, and saving/loading from JSON files. All data is predefined within the test code, with no external input or output manipulation that could be malicious. No use of environment variables, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be standard unit test code aimed at verifying functionality, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward test code for the data structures and persistence methods, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
