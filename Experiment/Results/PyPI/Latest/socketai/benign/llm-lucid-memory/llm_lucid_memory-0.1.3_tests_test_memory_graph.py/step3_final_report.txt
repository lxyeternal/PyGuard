  "purpose": "Unit tests for MemoryGraph and MemoryNode classes, verifying add, retrieve, search, save, and load functionalities.",
  "sources": "Static data within the test functions, such as node definitions and file paths.",
  "sinks": "File system operations for saving and loading JSON files; no untrusted input or network activity.",
  "flows": "Creation of nodes -> addition to graph -> retrieval or search -> save to JSON -> load from JSON -> retrieval again.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected; code is straightforward and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing with static data and local file I/O. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's purpose is to test core functionalities of data structures, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and controlled environment of the tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard testing code with no security concerns. All signals indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
