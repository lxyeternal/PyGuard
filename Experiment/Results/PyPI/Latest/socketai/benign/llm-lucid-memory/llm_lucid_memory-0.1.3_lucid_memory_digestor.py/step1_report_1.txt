  "purpose": "A class 'Digestor' designed to process raw text, extract reasoning paths, generate summaries, and auto-tag content, then create MemoryNode objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'raw_text' in digest() method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows leading to potential data leaks or external effects; no external outputs or network operations",
  "flows": "raw_text input is processed internally for comments and keyword detection, then used to create MemoryNode objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward string processing and object instantiation without unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing for type annotations and a MemoryNode class, then defines a Digestor class with methods for processing text. The digest() method extracts comment lines and adds default reasoning if none are found, then creates a MemoryNode instance with provided data. Helper methods _summarize and _extract_reasoning_paths are simple string manipulations, and auto_tag assigns tags based on simple keyword presence. No code injection, data exfiltration, network access, or obfuscation features are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for processing text into structured memory nodes, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
