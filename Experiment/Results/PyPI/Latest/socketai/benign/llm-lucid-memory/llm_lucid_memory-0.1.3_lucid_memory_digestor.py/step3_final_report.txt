  "purpose": "Process input text to extract comments, generate summaries, auto-tag based on keywords, and create a MemoryNode object.",
  "sources": "Input parameter raw_text, reading lines and comments within the text.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data beyond internal processing.",
  "flows": "Input raw_text -> comment extraction and keyword analysis -> MemoryNode creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string processing with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple string manipulations: extracting comments as reasoning paths, generating a summary from the first line, and tagging based on keywords 'server', 'memory', 'network'. It creates a MemoryNode object with these attributes. No network activity, external data handling, or malicious logic is present. The functions are deterministic and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is benign and utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for processing text into structured data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
