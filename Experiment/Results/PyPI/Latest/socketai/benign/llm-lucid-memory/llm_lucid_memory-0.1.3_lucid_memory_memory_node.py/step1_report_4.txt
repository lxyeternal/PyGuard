  "purpose": "Defines a MemoryNode class for storing and converting memory node data, including identifiers, raw data, summaries, reasoning paths, tags, and optional source information.",
  "sources": "Data is received through the from_dict method and the class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs via the to_dict method; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class instantiation and then back into dictionaries via to_dict, with no external data manipulation or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard data handling and object serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for memory nodes, with methods for serialization and deserialization. There are no external data sources, network activities, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be straightforward data management logic with standard Python features, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container class with serialization methods, showing no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in managing structured memory node data.",
