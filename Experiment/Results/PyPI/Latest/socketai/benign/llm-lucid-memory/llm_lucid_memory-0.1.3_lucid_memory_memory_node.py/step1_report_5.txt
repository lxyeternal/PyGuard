  "purpose": "Define a MemoryNode class for storing and converting node data to and from dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Class constructor parameters, class methods, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "Conversion methods (to_dict and from_dict) that process data, potential for injection if data is malicious, but no explicit unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, and then into dictionaries via to_dict, and vice versa with from_dict.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data container class with standard methods for serialization and deserialization. No external input handling or network operations are present. The class solely manages data fields and their conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data model implementation with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It is benign and safe for use.",
