  "purpose": "Defines a MemoryNode class for storing structured data with serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or data sources; class attributes initialized from parameters or dictionary data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters or dictionary to class attributes and vice versa via to_dict and from_dict methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic; standard data container implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class with methods for converting to and from dictionaries. It does not include any network operations, input/output beyond data assignment, or external calls. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure implementation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
