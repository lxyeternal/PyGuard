  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, files, network operations, user input.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data handling and processing routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets; assessments are based on descriptions. Reports 1-3 correctly identify absence of code, assigning zero scores. Reports 4 and 5 analyze typical utility code, noting standard library use, benign data flows, and no signs of malicious activity. Confidence scores in reports 4 and 5 are high but should be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature. Malware and obfuscation scores are consistently zero, aligning with the analysis. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by the benign description but conservative enough to account for unknowns.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to confidence levels in reports 4 and 5 to better match their benign assessments. Overall, the dependency appears safe, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.",
