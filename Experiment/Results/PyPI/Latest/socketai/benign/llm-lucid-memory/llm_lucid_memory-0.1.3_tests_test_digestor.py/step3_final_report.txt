{
  "purpose": "The code consists of simple test functions that instantiate a Digestor object, process static code snippets or descriptions, and verify the generated nodes' attributes, serving as unit tests or documentation analysis validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string inputs within the test functions, such as code snippets and descriptive strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output data in a way that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to creating a Digestor instance, digesting static input, and asserting properties of the resulting node; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and intended for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of benign test functions that instantiate a class, process static strings, and perform assertions. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising operations are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature. Confidence levels are high, justified by the simplicity and static nature of the code. No external data flows or system interactions are involved. The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0. The overall risk is negligible. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
