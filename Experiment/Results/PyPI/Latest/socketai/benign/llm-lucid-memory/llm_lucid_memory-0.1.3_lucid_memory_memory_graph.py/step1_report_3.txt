  "purpose": "Defines a MemoryGraph class for managing MemoryNode objects with functionalities to add, retrieve, search, save, and load nodes from a JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading from JSON files in save_to_json and load_from_json methods.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to JSON files in save_to_json; reading data from JSON files in load_from_json.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class methods to file system via open() and json.dump/load functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of open() for file I/O is standard. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of a graph data structure with JSON serialization/deserialization. It imports json and typing modules, uses standard file operations, and calls methods of MemoryNode for data handling. No suspicious data handling, network operations, or obfuscated constructs are present. The functions are straightforward and serve typical purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign implementation for managing nodes within a memory graph, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
