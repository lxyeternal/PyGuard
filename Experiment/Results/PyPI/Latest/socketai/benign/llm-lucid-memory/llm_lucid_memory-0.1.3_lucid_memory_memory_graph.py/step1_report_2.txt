  "purpose": "Defines a MemoryGraph class for managing MemoryNode objects, including adding, retrieving, searching, and persisting nodes to JSON files.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations in save_to_json and load_from_json methods; JSON data loading and dumping; usage of MemoryNode methods.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files via open() and json.dump(); reading from files via open() and json.load().",
  "flows": "load_from_json reads data from a file, deserializes JSON, and populates nodes; save_to_json serializes nodes and writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network connections or external system manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a basic data structure for storing MemoryNode objects with methods to serialize and deserialize from JSON files. It uses standard Python libraries for file handling and JSON operations. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All methods perform typical file I/O and data processing tasks. No sensitive data handling or insecure coding patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a memory graph with persistence features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign data management class with standard file I/O and JSON serialization. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe for use.",
