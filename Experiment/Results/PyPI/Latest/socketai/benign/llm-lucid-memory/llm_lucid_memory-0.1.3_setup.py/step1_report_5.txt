  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'llm-lucid-memory', including package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package requirements and metadata in setup()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Reading file content (source) used in setup parameters (sink), which is standard and benign",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward setup process",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to include as long description, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no data leaks. No suspicious or malicious patterns present. Use of standard setuptools functions and explicit dependencies indicates typical package setup behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
