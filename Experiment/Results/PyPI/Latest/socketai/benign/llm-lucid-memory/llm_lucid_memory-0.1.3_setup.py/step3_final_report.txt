  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; package metadata and dependencies declared in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, reading a local README.md, and calling setup() with package info, dependencies, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. Dependencies are common packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The dependency list and code structure do not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
