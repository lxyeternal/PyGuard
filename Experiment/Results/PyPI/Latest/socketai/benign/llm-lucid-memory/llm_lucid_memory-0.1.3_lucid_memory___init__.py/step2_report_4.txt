  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module initializer, importing classes from local modules and defining `__all__`.\n- No suspicious behaviors, such as data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution, are identified.\n- The code is consistent with typical Python package structure, especially for `__init__.py` files.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0 or very close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code presence:** The code contains only import statements and an `__all__` declaration. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Potential flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. No logical flaws or assumptions are evident.\n- The only point to consider is whether the local modules (`digestor`, `memory_graph`, `memory_node`) could contain malicious code. However, since the reports focus solely on this module, and no suspicious activity is evident here, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified.\n- The **security risk** scores are either 0 or very low (0.1). Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of this module.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is a typical module initializer for a Python package.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
