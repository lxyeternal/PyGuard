  "purpose": "Module initializer exporting classes Digestor, MemoryGraph, and MemoryNode for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: digestor, memory_graph, memory_node.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing classes from local modules and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The only minor inconsistency is a report assigning securityRisk=0.1, which should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate; the slight elevation in securityRisk score in one report should be corrected to zero. The code presents no security concerns.",
