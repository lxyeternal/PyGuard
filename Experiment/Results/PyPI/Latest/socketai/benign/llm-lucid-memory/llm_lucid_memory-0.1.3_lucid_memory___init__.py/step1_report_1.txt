{
  "purpose": "This code module exports three classes for external use, likely part of a larger project involving data processing or memory management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .digestor, .memory_graph, and .memory_node.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; primarily just imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. This is typical for Python package __init__.py files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data processing that could pose a security concern. It appears to be straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer exporting classes for use in a larger project. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscated code. It is safe and appears to be a normal part of a Python package.",
