{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes from other files and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package's modules: digestor, memory_graph, and memory_node.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present, as the code only imports classes and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution or external data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes from local modules and specifies them as the public API. It functions as a simple module initializer, with no logic that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer and public API definition. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
