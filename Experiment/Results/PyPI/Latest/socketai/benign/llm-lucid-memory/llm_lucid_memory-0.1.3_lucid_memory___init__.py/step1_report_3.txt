{
  "purpose": "The code exports three classes from local modules for use elsewhere, likely part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .digestor, .memory_graph, .memory_node",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; just module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines __all__ for module exports, importing classes from sibling modules. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network access, or data processing that could indicate malicious intent. All operations are straightforward and typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign component of a larger codebase.",
