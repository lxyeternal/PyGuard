  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .digestor, .memory_graph, .memory_node.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "Imports do not process untrusted data; no data flow to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export statements, no dynamic code, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports three local components and declares them as part of the module's public API. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an export interface for local modules without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be standard module aggregation code.",
