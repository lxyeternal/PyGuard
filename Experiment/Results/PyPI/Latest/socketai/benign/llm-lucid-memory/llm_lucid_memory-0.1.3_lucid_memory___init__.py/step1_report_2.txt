  "purpose": "Module exports for classes Digestor, MemoryGraph, and MemoryNode",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .digestor, .memory_graph, .memory_node",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to sink observed; module primarily defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports and defines an export list. It does not process input, handle data, or invoke any functions that could lead to security issues. No obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. The imported modules are local, and the export list is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign, serving as a part of a larger package structure.",
