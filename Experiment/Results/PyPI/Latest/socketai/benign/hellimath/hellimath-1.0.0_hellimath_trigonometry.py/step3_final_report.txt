  "purpose": "Mathematical utility functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent of angles given in degrees.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'degrees' for each function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'degrees' -> conversion to radians -> math.sin/math.cos/math.tan -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard math library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions that convert degrees to radians and compute sine, cosine, and tangent using Python's math library. It involves no external data sources, network activity, file I/O, or obfuscated code. The functions are simple wrappers around standard math functions with direct parameter input. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on standard libraries indicate a benign utility module. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward mathematical utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
