{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent of angles specified in degrees.",
  "sources": "The functions read input values from the 'degrees' parameter provided to each function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the math functions is returned directly; there are no sinks involving untrusted data leading to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'degrees' is converted to radians and passed to math.sin, math.cos, and math.tan functions, then results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and uses standard math library functions without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple functions that convert degrees to radians and compute trigonometric functions. It does not handle external inputs, read from files, or perform network operations. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for trigonometric calculations in degrees. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
