  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code consists of three functions: `sin_deg`, `cos_deg`, and `tan_deg`. Each converts degrees to radians and then computes the respective trigonometric function using Python's `math` library.  \n   - **Presence of issues**: The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.  \n   - **Are the reported issues present?**: All reports state that the code is simple, standard, and free of anomalies. This matches the actual code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a benign utility with no security risks or malware indications.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`. This aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforwardness of the code.  \n   - No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - The code is purely mathematical and does not interact with external systems, handle untrusted input beyond parameters, or contain any obfuscated or malicious code.  \n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   - Since the code performs no malicious actions, the malware score should remain at 0.  \n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports are cautious and do not make unwarranted assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a simple, well-defined mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No further action needed.",
