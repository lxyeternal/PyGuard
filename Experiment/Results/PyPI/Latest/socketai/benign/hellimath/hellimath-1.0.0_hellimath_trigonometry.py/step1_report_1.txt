  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent of angles given in degrees.",
  "sources": "User inputs are the 'degrees' parameter passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions from the math library that process the input; no direct data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'degrees' flows into math.radians, then into math.sin, math.cos, or math.tan respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; functions are straightforward and well-defined. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple mathematical functions converting degrees to radians and computing trigonometric values. No external data fetching, no network communication, no file operations, and no use of untrusted input beyond function parameters. The functions are standard math library calls. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
