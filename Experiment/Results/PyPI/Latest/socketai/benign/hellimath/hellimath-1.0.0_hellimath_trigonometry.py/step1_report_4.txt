{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle given in degrees.",
  "sources": "User inputs are the 'degrees' parameter passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "Math functions operate internally; no external data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input (degrees) flows into math.radians(), then into math.sin(), math.cos(), or math.tan() functions; no external or untrusted data flow outside this process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward mathematical conversion functions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple functions converting degrees to radians and computing trigonometric functions. It uses the standard math library with no dynamic code execution, no input validation or handling of untrusted data, and no external network or file operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard mathematical utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic trigonometric calculations from degree input with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
