  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of angles given in degrees.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (degrees).",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical computations; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input degrees are converted to radians and used directly in math functions, with no external data flow or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code. Functions are straightforward mathematical wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent for angles specified in degrees. It converts degrees to radians using math.radians() and then applies the respective math functions. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious constructs. The code is simple, clean, and implements standard mathematical operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic mathematical calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security concerns.",
