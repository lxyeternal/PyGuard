{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute sine, cosine, and tangent of angles given in degrees.",
  "sources": "Input is the parameter 'degrees' passed to each function; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output streams are involved beyond returning computed values.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'degrees' flows into math.radians() and then into math.sin(), math.cos(), or math.tan(). No untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward mathematical conversions without any hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions to convert degrees to radians and compute trigonometric functions using Python's math library. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The functions are simple and perform standard calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic mathematical operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
