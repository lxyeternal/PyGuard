{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for symbolic differentiation and definite integration using trusted mathematical libraries.",
  "sources": "Input expressions or functions provided as parameters ('expression', 'variable', 'func', 'a', 'b')",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'sp.diff' and 'spi.quad' with potentially untrusted inputs; no direct data leaks or malicious code execution within the code itself",
  "flows": "Input expressions/variables/ functions flow into library functions for differentiation and integration without dynamic evaluation of untrusted code",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple wrapper functions around sympy.diff and scipy.integrate.quad, which are standard trusted libraries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. Potential risks could arise if 'expression' or 'func' are supplied from untrusted sources, as they could contain malicious code or cause unintended behavior during evaluation or invocation. However, the functions themselves do not evaluate or execute untrusted code directly. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this understanding, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the minimal inherent risk from untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and relies on trusted libraries. The primary concern is the potential for malicious inputs if external data is untrusted, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1) is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
