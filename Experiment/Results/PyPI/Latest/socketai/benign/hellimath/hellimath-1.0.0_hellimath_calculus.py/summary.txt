  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and relies on trusted libraries. The primary concern is the potential for malicious inputs if external data is untrusted, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1) is appropriate. No modifications are necessary."
