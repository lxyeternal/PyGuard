{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical operations: symbolic differentiation and numerical definite integration using sympy and scipy libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports sympy and scipy modules; function parameters receive expressions, variables, and interval bounds.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data output or network communication; no sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input expressions and variables flow into sympy.diff for differentiation; input functions and bounds flow into scipy.quad for integration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code; standard use of mathematical libraries with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic mathematical computations using well-known libraries. No external data is fetched or sent; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The functions rely on trusted library functions for calculations. No apparent malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is straightforward and utilizes standard mathematical libraries for differentiation and integration. It poses no security risks or malicious intent based on the provided code.",
