{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for symbolic differentiation and numerical definite integration of mathematical expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'expression' parameter for differentiation and the 'func' parameter for integration, which are intended to be mathematical expressions or functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'sp.diff' and 'spi.quad' are used to process the inputs. These are standard library functions for symbolic differentiation and numerical integration, respectively. No untrusted data is directly sent to external systems or the network.",
  "flows": "Input expressions are passed to symbolic and numerical library functions; there are no evident data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard library functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sympy' for symbolic math and defines a function to differentiate an expression with respect to a variable. It also imports 'scipy.integrate' to perform numerical integration over a specified interval. Both functions appear straightforward, relying on well-known scientific libraries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard mathematical utility module implementing differentiation and integration functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe based on the provided content.",
