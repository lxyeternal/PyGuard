  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code performs straightforward mathematical operations using trusted libraries (sympy and scipy).\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity is found.\n- The only potential concern is that input expressions or functions could be supplied from untrusted sources, which might lead to code execution if those inputs are maliciously crafted.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as standard math utilities with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Comment:** The securityRisk is set at 0.2, which is somewhat conservative, considering the potential for untrusted inputs to cause issues. Since the functions accept expressions that could be user-supplied, a small risk is justified, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion—benign mathematical functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar, straightforward math functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes that if 'expression' or 'func' are from untrusted sources, malicious code could be executed during evaluation or invocation.\n- **Key Point:** The functions themselves are wrappers; the actual risk depends on the inputs, not the code structure.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Justification:** Given the potential for malicious inputs, a small security risk score (0.1) is reasonable. The malware score remains 0 because there's no evidence of malicious code within the provided functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation; some reports assign 0, others 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting the potential risk if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Considering the code:**\n\n- The functions are simple wrappers around trusted libraries.\n- The only potential vulnerability is if the input expressions or functions are supplied from untrusted sources, which could lead to code execution or malicious behavior during evaluation or invocation.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**.\n- The **security risk score** should be **around 0.1 to 0.2**, depending on how conservative we are about untrusted inputs.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (small risk if inputs are untrusted, but no inherent malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable.\n- No changes needed unless further context indicates input validation issues.\n- The overall assessment: **The code is safe and standard**, with minimal risk depending on input sources.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns                  |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1               | Slight risk if inputs are untrusted; no inherent vulnerabilities |\n\nThis concludes the review.",
