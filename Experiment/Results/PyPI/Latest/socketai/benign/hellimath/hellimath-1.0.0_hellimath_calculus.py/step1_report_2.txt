{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for symbolic differentiation and numerical integration of mathematical expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'expression' parameter for differentiation and the 'func' parameter for integration, which may be user-supplied or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The differentiation and integration functions call external libraries (sympy and scipy) without executing untrusted code directly. No output or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "flows": "Input expressions are processed by sympy.diff and scipy.quad, with no evident flow of untrusted data to external systems or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated patterns are present. Functions are straightforward. There is no dynamic code execution or suspicious variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for symbolic differentiation using sympy and one for numerical definite integration using scipy. Both functions accept input parameters that could potentially be supplied from untrusted sources. However, the use of sympy.diff and scipy.quad is standard for their respective purposes. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a benign utility for mathematical calculations. There are no indications of hidden functionality or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mathematical functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on trusted libraries and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
