  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions for differentiation and definite integration using open-source libraries sympy and scipy.",
  "sources": "Reads input expressions (for differentiation) and numerical bounds (for integration).",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input expressions and variables flow into sympy.diff; input functions and bounds flow into scipy.quad for calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of standard mathematical libraries with typical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sympy for symbolic differentiation and scipy for numerical integration. The differentiate function converts a string variable into a sympy.Symbol and computes its derivative; the definite_integral function calls scipy.quad with a function and bounds. Both functions utilize well-known libraries in standard ways without suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present. No anomalies or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mathematical operations using reputable open-source libraries with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
