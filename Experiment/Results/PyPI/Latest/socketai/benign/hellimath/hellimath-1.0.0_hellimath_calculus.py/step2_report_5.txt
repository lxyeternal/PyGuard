  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries (sympy and scipy) for mathematical operations.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The only potential concern is that the input expressions or functions could be untrusted, which might lead to malicious code execution if they are callables or strings evaluated internally—though the code as given does not execute code dynamically or evaluate strings.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; code is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a security risk of 0.2, citing that input expressions may be untrusted.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to potential untrusted input, but no actual malicious activity)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the potential for untrusted input to cause issues, but no actual malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The securityRisk could remain at 0, but 0.1 might also be reasonable if we consider the untrusted input angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, standard usage.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Noted that if 'expression' or 'func' are untrusted, they could be malicious when invoked, especially for 'func' which is a callable used in scipy.quad.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0.1\n\n**Justification:** Since the functions accept external inputs that could be malicious if not validated, assigning a small security risk (0.1) is reasonable. The malware score remains 0 because no actual malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n- All reports appropriately assign malware scores of 0.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting potential issues with untrusted inputs but no actual malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- For the highest confidence, I would agree with the existing scores, perhaps slightly adjusting the security risk in Report 3 to 0.1 for consistency, but 0.0 is also acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (small potential risk due to untrusted inputs, especially in the 'func' parameter)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-understood, and uses standard libraries without malicious intent. The minor security concern relates to untrusted inputs, which is common in mathematical utility functions but does not constitute malware or significant security risk.",
