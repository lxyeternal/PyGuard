  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's actual behavior.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, importing the `statistics` module and defining wrapper functions for mean, median, and standard deviation. The code does not perform any external data handling, user input, or suspicious operations. Therefore, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious activity. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \nAll reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The `securityRisk` scores are also 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince the code is simple, uses only standard library functions, and has no suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports agree on a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nThe malware scores are 0 in all reports, which is accurate given the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They all base their conclusions on the code's straightforward functionality.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's behavior. All reports correctly reflect the benign and safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive and accurate reports, my evaluation aligns with theirs. The code is a simple, benign utility module wrapping standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is safe and should not be flagged for security concerns.",
