{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation) for a dataset using Python's standard library.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'data' in each function, which are input datasets provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; functions return computed values without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input datasets flow into standard library functions, which process and return results; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and uses trusted libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'statistics' module and defines three wrapper functions that directly call the corresponding standard library functions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's clarity and standard library usage. Overall, the code is a safe utility module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of statistical functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
