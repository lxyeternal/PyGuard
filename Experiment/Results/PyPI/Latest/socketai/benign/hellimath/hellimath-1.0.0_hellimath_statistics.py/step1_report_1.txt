{
  "purpose": "Provides basic statistical functions for computing mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data passed as arguments to the functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or execution effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into the statistics functions, then results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'statistics' module and defines three simple wrapper functions for calculating mean, median, and standard deviation. These functions directly pass their input data to the corresponding 'statistics' module functions without any data manipulation, user input, or external interactions. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs standard calculations without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No source-to-sink or unusual code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of statistical functions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
