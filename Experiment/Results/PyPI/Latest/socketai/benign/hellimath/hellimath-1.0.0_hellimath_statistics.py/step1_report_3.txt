{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) on a dataset.",
  "sources": "The functions read data passed as arguments to compute statistical metrics.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return computed statistics without external data output or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to statistical calculations, with no external or untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious constructs. Uses standard library functions as expected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining three functions that utilize the 'statistics' module to compute common statistical measures. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no insecure code, nor malicious behavior. The functions accept datasets and return computed values. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present. The code appears clean and intended solely for statistical calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard statistical calculations with no suspicious or malicious intent. It is a typical utility module with no security concerns.",
