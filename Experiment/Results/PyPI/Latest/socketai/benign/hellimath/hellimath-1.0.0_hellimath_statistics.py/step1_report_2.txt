{
  "purpose": "Provides basic statistical functions (mean, median, standard deviation) for datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data to functions: 'data' parameter passed to mean, median, and standard_deviation functions.",
  "targets": "Uses 'statistics' module functions internally; no external data targets or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within each function to compute statistical measures; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. The code strictly wraps standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'statistics' module and defines three functions to compute mean, median, and standard deviation. Each function directly calls the corresponding 'statistics' function on the provided dataset. There are no external data exchanges, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs, and no indicators of malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward and utilize trusted standard library methods without additional side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper around Python's standard 'statistics' module functions. It exhibits no signs of malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no anomalies suggestive of security risks.",
