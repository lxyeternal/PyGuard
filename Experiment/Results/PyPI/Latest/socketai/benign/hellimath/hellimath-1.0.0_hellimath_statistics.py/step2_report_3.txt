  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports describe a straightforward wrapper around Python's `statistics` module, defining functions for mean, median, and standard deviation. The original code matches this description exactly. There are no discrepancies or indications that the actual code differs from the reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   - **Malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm the code is clear and unobfuscated.  \n   - **Security risks:** No external data leaks, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n   - **Errors or flaws:** The code is simple and correct; no logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All 0, justified as the code performs basic, safe calculations without external interactions.  \n   - **Confidence:** 1 in all reports, justified by the straightforward, well-understood code.\n\n4. **Potential for Reassessment:**  \n   Since the code is a direct wrapper around trusted standard library functions, and no suspicious behavior is detected, the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.  \n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0, as there is no evidence suggesting malicious activity.  \n- The confidence scores should stay at 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the content of all reports.",
