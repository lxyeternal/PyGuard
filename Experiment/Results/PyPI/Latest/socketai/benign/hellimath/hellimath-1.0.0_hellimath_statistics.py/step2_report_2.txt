  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward wrapper around Python's `statistics` module, implementing mean, median, and standard deviation functions.\n   - The code simply takes input data, calls trusted standard library functions, and returns results.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any external data interactions, network activity, or data leaks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments that the code is benign and free of security issues are accurate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n   - They correctly identify the code as straightforward, standard, and non-malicious.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which aligns with the clear, simple code.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- Since the code is trivial and well-understood, the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk here is `securityRisk`, which is 0.\n   - `malware` and `obfuscated` are both 0, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores are justified as 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard library usage.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward utility module wrapping Python's `statistics` functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**  \n**The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk; confidence at 1) are appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as a precaution, but justified as 0)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nGiven the complete lack of suspicious activity, the minimal risk score reflects the negligible concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes are necessary.",
