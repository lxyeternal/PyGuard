{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical functions to compute mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' in each function, which is expected to be a list of numerical values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only processes data in memory without external outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter into the statistics functions to compute results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of the 'statistics' library with standard functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple functions that wrap the 'statistics' module's methods for mean, median, and standard deviation. No external data sources, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The functions are safe and serve standard statistical purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a clean, utility module with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard statistical calculations without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
