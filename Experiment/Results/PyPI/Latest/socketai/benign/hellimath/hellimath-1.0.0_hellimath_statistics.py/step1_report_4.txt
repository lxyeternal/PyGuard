{
  "purpose": "Provides basic statistical functions: mean, median, and standard deviation for a dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the parameter 'data' passed to each function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions return computed statistical values without interacting with external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into each statistical function and the computed results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, using standard library functions without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'statistics' library and defines three functions: mean, median, and standard deviation. Each function computes the respective statistical measure on the provided dataset. No external data sources, user inputs, or environment variables are accessed. No suspicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of calculating basic statistics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate implementation of statistical functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and unlikely to be involved in any supply chain attack or malicious activity.",
