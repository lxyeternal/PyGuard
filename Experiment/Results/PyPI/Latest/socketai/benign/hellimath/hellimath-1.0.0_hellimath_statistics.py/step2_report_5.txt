  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the Original Code:**\n- Imports the `statistics` module.\n- Defines three functions: `mean`, `median`, `standard_deviation`.\n- Each function directly calls the corresponding `statistics` function with the provided data.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as simple wrappers around the `statistics` module.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- They consistently conclude the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.\n- Malware scores are 0, security risks are 0, and obfuscation is 0.\n- The analyses are aligned and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports accurately describe the code's functionality and confirm the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None are necessary; the code is non-malicious, and the scores reflect that.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since the code only performs standard statistical calculations with no external interactions or suspicious behavior, malware should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on the actual code behavior, which is safe.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No malicious activity or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0  \n  No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a simple, safe implementation of statistical functions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
