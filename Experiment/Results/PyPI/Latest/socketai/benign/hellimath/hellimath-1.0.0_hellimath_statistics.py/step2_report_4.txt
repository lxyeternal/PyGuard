  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The *original code* is a straightforward wrapper around Python's standard `statistics` module, defining three functions: `mean`, `median`, and `standard_deviation`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The *scores* assigned are all zeros for malware and security risk, with high confidence (1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and behavior:\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description in each report; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code only calls standard library functions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Data flows:** Input data flows from parameters into standard functions, no external or untrusted data sources or sinks.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No flawed assumptions or reasoning are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n\n- The *risk scores* are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The *malware scores* are all zero, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- The *obfuscated* scores are zero, matching the code clarity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is a simple, benign utility module with no security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Confirm the scores as-is.",
