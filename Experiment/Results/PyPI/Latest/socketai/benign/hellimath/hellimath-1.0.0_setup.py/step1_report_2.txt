{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python library called 'hellimath', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file to generate long description; loads dependencies from 'install_requires' list; inspects setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential for reading external files ('README.md'), but no untrusted data handling, no network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content during setup; dependencies are specified but not dynamically loaded from untrusted sources; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional file reading with a check for 'README.md' existence; usage of 'open' during setup, but no malicious or suspicious activity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' setup procedures. It conditionally reads 'README.md' if present, which is a common practice. Dependencies are standard Python packages with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors. The code structure is typical for Python package setup files. No anomalies or malicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or credential leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a documentation file conditionally and specifies dependencies securely. No suspicious activity detected.",
