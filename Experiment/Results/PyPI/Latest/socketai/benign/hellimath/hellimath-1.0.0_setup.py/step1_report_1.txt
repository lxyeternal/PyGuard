{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'hellimath', used to specify package metadata, dependencies, and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'os' module to list directory contents",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The code reads 'README.md' if it exists, but this is a benign operation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The conditional reading of 'README.md' uses a non-standard check ('README.md' in __import__('os').listdir()), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules for package setup. It attempts to conditionally read 'README.md' based on its presence in the current directory, using a standard OS directory listing. Dependencies are specified explicitly. There are no external inputs, network operations, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is typical for a Python package setup. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
