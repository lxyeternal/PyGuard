  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'hellimath' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'os' module to list directory contents.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "os.listdir() -> check for 'README.md' -> open('README.md') -> read content -> pass to setup() as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('os') to conditionally read 'README.md' content is slightly unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' functions and defining package metadata. It conditionally reads 'README.md' if present in the current directory, using 'os.listdir()' obtained via dynamic import. This approach is somewhat atypical but not malicious. No external data is sent or received. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The dependencies are common scientific packages with no signs of sabotage. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data leaks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with minimal unusual elements. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
