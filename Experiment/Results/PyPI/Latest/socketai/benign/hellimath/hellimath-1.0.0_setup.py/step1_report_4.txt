{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'hellimath', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'os' module to list directory contents.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections or sensitive data leaks; no untrusted data is handled in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The script reads 'README.md' if present to set long_description, and uses find_packages() to locate packages; no data flows into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The conditional expression for long_description uses __import__('os').listdir(), which is a somewhat unusual but harmless way to check for file existence; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, employing common practices such as dynamic long_description loading and dependency specification. The use of __import__('os') to check for 'README.md' existence is slightly unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware signatures are present. The dependencies listed are typical scientific libraries. No obfuscated code, insecure patterns, or malicious flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows standard packaging practices with a minor unconventional check for README.md existence, which does not pose a security threat.",
