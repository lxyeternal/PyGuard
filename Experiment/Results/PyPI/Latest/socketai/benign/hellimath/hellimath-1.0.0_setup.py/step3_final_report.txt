{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, with a conditional read of README.md.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' via __import__('os').listdir() and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, external network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code performs static configuration tasks.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional check for 'README.md' existence using __import__('os').listdir(), but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It conditionally reads 'README.md' using an unusual method but does not execute or include untrusted code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. Dependencies are standard scientific libraries. The unconventional check does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware scores of 0 and low risk scores (~0.1), which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The unconventional check for 'README.md' does not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
