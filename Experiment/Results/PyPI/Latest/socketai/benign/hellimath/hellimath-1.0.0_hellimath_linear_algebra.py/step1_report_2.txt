{
  "purpose": "Provide basic linear algebra operations such as dot product and determinant calculation",
  "sources": "Input vectors (vec1, vec2) and matrix data passed to functions",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; functions perform mathematical calculations",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical functions, but no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security issues",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of mathematical operations without unusual code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines two functions for mathematical computations. Both functions perform standard operations: np.dot for vector multiplication and np.linalg.det for matrix determinant. No input validation, no data leaks, no code injection, and no external network or file operations are present. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic mathematical functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward, with no anomalous or suspicious patterns.",
