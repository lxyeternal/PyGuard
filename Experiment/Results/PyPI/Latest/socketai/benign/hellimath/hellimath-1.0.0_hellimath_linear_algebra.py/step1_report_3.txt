{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic mathematical operations: computing the dot product of two vectors and calculating the determinant of a matrix.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the function parameters 'vec1', 'vec2', and 'matrix'. These are expected to be data structures passed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code calls numpy functions that process these inputs to produce numerical outputs. No data is written to external systems or transmitted over a network.",
  "flows": "Input data (vectors and matrices) flow into numpy functions to produce results; there are no external data flows or untrusted data handling beyond function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard numpy functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines two functions for mathematical computations. The functions rely entirely on numpy's well-established methods. No hardcoded secrets, external data sources, or potentially malicious behavior are present. The functions are general-purpose and do not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard mathematical operations with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threats.",
