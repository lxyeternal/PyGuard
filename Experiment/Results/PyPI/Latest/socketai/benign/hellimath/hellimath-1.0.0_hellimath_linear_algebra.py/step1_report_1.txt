{
  "purpose": "Provides basic mathematical operations for vectors and matrices (dot product and determinant calculation).",
  "sources": "Inputs are 'vec1', 'vec2', and 'matrix' parameters passed to functions, which are used as arguments for numpy functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data, nor does it send data over networks or perform any I/O beyond standard function inputs/outputs.",
  "flows": "Input vectors and matrices flow directly into numpy functions without any intermediate processing or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual operations are present. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions utilizing numpy for mathematical operations: dot product and determinant. Both functions are standard mathematical computations. No data validation, sanitization, or external data handling occurs. No suspicious behaviors, external communications, or potential backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard mathematical operations without any malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for mathematical calculations.",
