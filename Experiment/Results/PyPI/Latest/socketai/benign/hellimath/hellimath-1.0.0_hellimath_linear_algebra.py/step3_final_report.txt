  "purpose": "Provides basic mathematical functions for vector dot product and matrix determinant using numpy.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'vec1', 'vec2', and 'matrix' which are inputs to numpy functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external communication or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into numpy functions without transformation or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions performing standard numpy operations: dot product and determinant. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The functions accept parameters directly used in numpy calls, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is simple, clear, and performs mathematical calculations only. Based on the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code's purpose and behavior are transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for mathematical computations with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this. No modifications are necessary.",
