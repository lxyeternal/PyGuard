{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute dot product of vectors and determinant of matrices, likely for mathematical or scientific computations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the function arguments: vec1, vec2, and matrix.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (vec1, vec2, matrix) passed directly to numpy functions; no complex data flows or external calls beyond numpy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of numpy for mathematical calculations is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions utilizing numpy: one for dot product, one for determinant. Both are straightforward mathematical operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or malicious side-effects. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard mathematical functions with no malicious intent. It is safe and unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged.",
