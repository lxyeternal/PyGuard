{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for mathematical operations: dot product and determinant calculation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: vec1, vec2, and matrix.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into numpy functions without transformation or validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward mathematical computations with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines two functions: one for dot product, another for determinant. Both functions directly pass inputs to numpy functions without validation or sanitization. There are no external data sources, no network calls, or hidden operations. The code appears to be standard mathematical utility functions with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, intended for mathematical calculations, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
