  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for mathematical operations: checking prime numbers, computing GCD, and computing LCM.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: 'n' in is_prime, 'a' and 'b' in gcd and lcm functions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is sent out, stored, or used in a potentially dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used internally for calculations; no external data flows or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical functions using conventional algorithms. No external data handling, network communication, or system modifications are present. The functions serve basic computational purposes and are implemented securely. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of mathematical utility functions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
