{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical utility functions for checking prime numbers, computing GCD, and computing LCM.",
  "sources": "No external data input; functions operate on provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that handle untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - functions operate purely on passed arguments without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; functions are straightforward implementations of standard algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three mathematical functions: 'is_prime', 'gcd', and 'lcm'. 'is_prime' checks for primality using a simple loop up to the square root of n, which is standard. 'gcd' implements Euclid's algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor, and 'lcm' calculates least common multiple using the gcd. All functions are standard mathematical utilities with no input/output operations, no external data access, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be benign, focused solely on mathematical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard mathematical utility functions with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It performs straightforward calculations without external data interactions or harmful code.",
