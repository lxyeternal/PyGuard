  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions to check prime numbers, compute GCD, and compute LCM.",
  "sources": "Reads input values for functions 'is_prime', 'gcd', and 'lcm'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input values are processed within each function; no external data flow or untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward and mathematically standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common mathematical functions for prime checking, GCD, and LCM using standard algorithms. It does not include any network calls, file operations, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The functions are purely computational and utilize safe, well-understood logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic mathematical operations without any signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe utility code with no anomalies.",
