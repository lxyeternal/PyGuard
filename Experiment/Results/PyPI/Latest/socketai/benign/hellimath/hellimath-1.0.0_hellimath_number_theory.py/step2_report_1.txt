  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code contains three functions: `is_prime`, `gcd`, and `lcm`.\n- All functions implement standard algorithms:\n  - `is_prime`: checks primality via trial division up to sqrt(n).\n  - `gcd`: Euclid's algorithm.\n  - `lcm`: computes least common multiple using gcd.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n- The code performs basic mathematical operations with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n\n**Review of the Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malware.\n- They mention standard algorithms, no external data flows, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Overall:** The assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n- The scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard utility functions.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility module implementing well-known algorithms.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The risk score should remain 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
