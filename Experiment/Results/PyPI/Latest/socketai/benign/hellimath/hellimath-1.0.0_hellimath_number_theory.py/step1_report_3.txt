{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for checking if a number is prime, computing the greatest common divisor, and computing the least common multiple.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters (n, a, b).",
  "targets": "No output targets involve untrusted data; functions return computed values based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through computational logic to produce output values (prime check, GCD, LCM).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical functions: is_prime, gcd, and lcm. Each function performs well-known calculations with no external data dependencies, no network calls, and no use of environment variables. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any hidden or suspicious operations. There are no anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to serve a purely mathematical purpose with proper implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs common computations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
