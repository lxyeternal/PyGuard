  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code implements standard mathematical functions: `is_prime`, `gcd`, and `lcm`. The code appears to be straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data handling. There are no errors or flaws in the logic or implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. This assessment is accurate given the code provided. No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks, raising the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code performs only mathematical computations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the actual code provided, with no unwarranted assumptions. Their assessments are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility module implementing well-known algorithms.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall evaluation aligns with the provided code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is benign, safe, and standard.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
