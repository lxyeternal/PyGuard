{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical functions to check if a number is prime, compute the greatest common divisor, and compute the least common multiple.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through function parameters: 'n' for is_prime, 'a' and 'b' for gcd and lcm functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; no data is written out to files, networks, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed within the functions; there are no untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical algorithms for prime checking, GCD, and LCM. The functions use typical control flow and mathematical operations. There are no external data interactions, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The functions operate solely on provided input values without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard mathematical computations with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of common algorithms.",
