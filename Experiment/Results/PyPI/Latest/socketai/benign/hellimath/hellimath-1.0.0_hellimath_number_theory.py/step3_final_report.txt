  "purpose": "Implement basic mathematical utility functions: prime check, gcd, and lcm.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'n' in is_prime; 'a' and 'b' in gcd and lcm functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; functions return results without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through computations to return values; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three functions: is_prime, gcd, and lcm, all implementing standard algorithms without external dependencies or malicious code. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The functions perform mathematical calculations with no data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. The reports uniformly conclude benign nature with high confidence. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module implementing standard mathematical algorithms. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
