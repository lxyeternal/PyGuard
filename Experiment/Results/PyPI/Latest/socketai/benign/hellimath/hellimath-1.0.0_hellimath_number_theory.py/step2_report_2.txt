  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code verification:**  \n   The original code implements four functions: `is_prime`, `gcd`, and `lcm`. The implementations are standard, straightforward, and free of any suspicious or malicious constructs. No anomalies, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Presence of issues:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. This aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose as utility functions.\n\n3. **Scores review:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code performs only mathematical calculations without external data handling or network activity.\n\n4. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.  \n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.  \n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Additional considerations:**  \n   - The functions are implemented using standard algorithms without any known vulnerabilities.  \n   - The prime check function could be optimized (e.g., skipping even numbers after 2), but that does not impact security or malware assessment.  \n   - There are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities that are questionable.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious intent.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports' evaluations are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a standard utility module with no security concerns.",
