  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical functions for solving quadratic equations, computing factorials, and generating Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: a, b, c for solve_quadratic; n for factorial and Fibonacci functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing results; no external data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Inputs to functions flow to computations within each function; no external or untrusted data is used outside inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Recursive Fibonacci implementation could be inefficient but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical functions with standard implementations. The quadratic solver calculates discriminant and roots. The factorial function uses recursion, which is typical. The Fibonacci function uses naive recursion, which may have performance issues but not security concerns. No external data access, no system manipulation, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs basic mathematical computations without malicious intent or security risks. It shows no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
