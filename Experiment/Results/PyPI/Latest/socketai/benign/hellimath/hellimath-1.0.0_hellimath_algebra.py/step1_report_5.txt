  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions for solving quadratic equations, calculating factorials, and generating Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: a, b, c for solve_quadratic; n for factorial and Fibonacci.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions; no external data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculations within each function; no external or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Recursive Fibonacci implementation is inefficient but benign; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward mathematical computations with standard formulas. No use of network, file I/O, environment variables, or external data sources. The recursive Fibonacci function could be exploited for denial-of-service if misused, but this is typical and not malicious per se. No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve legitimate mathematical purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
