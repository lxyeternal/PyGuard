  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions for solving quadratic equations, calculating factorial, and computing Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a, b, c for solve_quadratic; n for factorial and fibonacci functions.",
  "targets": "Return values and computed results; no external output or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in computations; results are returned locally, no external communication or data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. Functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard mathematical functions without external input validation, but uses safe mathematical operations. No external data sources or sinks, no network or file I/O, and no code injection mechanisms. Recursive fibonacci could be inefficient but not malicious. No hidden code or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign mathematical utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any malicious operations, data leaks, or external communications.",
