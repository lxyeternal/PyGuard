  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions for solving quadratic equations, computing factorials, and generating Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'n' in the functions 'solve_quadratic', 'factorial', and 'fibonacci'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in 'solve_quadratic' and 'factorial', recursive calls in 'fibonacci'. No data is sent over networks or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions and produce outputs; no external data flow to untrusted sources or sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The recursive Fibonacci implementation is inefficient but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard mathematical functions with straightforward implementations. 'solve_quadratic' correctly computes solutions, 'factorial' uses recursion, and 'fibonacci' employs naive recursion. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected. No external communication, data leakage, or malicious activity present. The code appears purely computational with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for mathematical calculations without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
