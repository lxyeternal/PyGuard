  "purpose": "Mathematical utility functions: solving quadratic equations, computing factorials, and Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (a, b, c, n). No external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions; results are returned directly without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical functions: quadratic solver, factorial, and Fibonacci. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The recursive Fibonacci is inefficient but benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code's logic is transparent and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
