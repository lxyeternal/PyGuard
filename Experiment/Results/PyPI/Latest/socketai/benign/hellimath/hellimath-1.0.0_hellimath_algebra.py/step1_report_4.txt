  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions: solving quadratic equations, computing factorial, and Fibonacci numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'n'.",
  "sinks": "Return values from functions; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into calculations; results are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard mathematical functions: solving quadratic equations, calculating factorial recursively, and Fibonacci sequence recursively. All functions perform deterministic calculations with no external I/O, network activity, or data leaks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code structure is straightforward, and there are no hidden behaviors or unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing common mathematical operations with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks.",
