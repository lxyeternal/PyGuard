  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, implementing basic mathematical functions: quadratic solver, factorial, and Fibonacci.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or data leaks are observed.\n- The functions are standard and do not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The recursive Fibonacci implementation, while inefficient, is not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Specific points to consider:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The recursive Fibonacci function is inefficient but not malicious. The reports correctly identify this.\n- No mention of input validation or exception handling, but this does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Summary of scoring justification:**\n\n- The malware score should remain 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0, as the code is clear.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the benign analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a simple utility library with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Given the comprehensive and consistent analysis, I agree with the assigned scores. There is no need to adjust the scores upward. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
