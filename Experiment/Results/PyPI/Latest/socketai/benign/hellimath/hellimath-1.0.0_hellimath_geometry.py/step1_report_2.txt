{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to compute the area of a circle and the perimeter of a rectangle, likely for geometric calculations.",
  "sources": "No input sources; functions accept parameters 'radius', 'length', and 'width' provided during function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output other than the return values of functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters to return statements; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard math library functions without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two functions: 'area_circle' and 'perimeter_rectangle'. Both perform simple mathematical computations with parameters supplied at runtime. There are no input/output sources that could be exploited, no hardcoded secrets, and no external system interactions. The code structure is simple, and the functions are self-contained, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic geometric calculations without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
