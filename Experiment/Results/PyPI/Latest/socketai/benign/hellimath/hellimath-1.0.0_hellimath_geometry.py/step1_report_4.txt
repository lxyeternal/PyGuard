{
  "purpose": "Calculate geometric properties such as the area of a circle and perimeter of a rectangle.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'radius', 'length', and 'width' are sourced from function arguments provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or potential data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (radius, length, width) are used directly in mathematical calculations; no data is transmitted externally or processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions performing basic geometric calculations using the math library. There are no external data reads beyond function parameters. No unusual language features, dynamic execution, or obfuscation are present. The functions perform standard mathematical operations without side effects or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focusing solely on geometric calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
