  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute the area of a circle and the perimeter of a rectangle.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; functions accept parameters, but no input reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations that could leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to mathematical computations with provided parameters; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward mathematical functions with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple geometric calculation functions, utilizing the 'math' library for π. There are no input reading, external data handling, or insecure operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The functions perform basic calculations and do not interact with network, files, or environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for geometric calculations. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks present.",
