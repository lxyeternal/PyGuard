{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate the area of a circle and the perimeter of a rectangle, intended for geometric computations.",
  "sources": "Parameters `radius`, `length`, and `width` supplied during function calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; functions return computed values without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into calculations, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using only standard math library functions, with no input/output operations, network activity, or external dependencies. It performs simple mathematical calculations with parameters provided at runtime. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs basic geometric calculations, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
