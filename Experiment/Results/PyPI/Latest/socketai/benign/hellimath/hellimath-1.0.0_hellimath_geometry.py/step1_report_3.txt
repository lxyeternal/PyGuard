  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute the area of a circle and the perimeter of a rectangle.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'radius', 'length', and 'width' for the functions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; functions return computed values",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into mathematical operations without external data sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward mathematical functions utilizing the standard 'math' library. No external data input is processed, nor are there any network operations, file manipulations, or code execution based on untrusted input. The functions are pure and simple, serving basic geometric calculations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and free from malicious behavior. It performs basic calculations without any security concerns.",
