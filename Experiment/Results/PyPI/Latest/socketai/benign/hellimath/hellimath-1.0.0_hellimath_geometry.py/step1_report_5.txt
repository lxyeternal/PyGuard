  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute geometric properties (area of a circle and perimeter of a rectangle).",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'radius', 'length', and 'width'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or external actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical calculations; no external data flow or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual language features observed. The code is straightforward and mathematically simple.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for geometric calculations using the math library. No external input handling beyond parameters, no untrusted data processing, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The functions appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
