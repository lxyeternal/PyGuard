{
  "purpose": "This code imports various mathematical functions from local modules within a package, likely to be used for computational or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: algebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, number_theory, linear_algebra.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions related to mathematical computations and sets package metadata. It does not include any code that handles input, output, or external data sources. There are no suspicious functions, code injection points, or network operations. The module structure appears standard for a mathematical utility package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements and metadata definitions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
