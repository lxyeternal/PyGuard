{
  "purpose": "The code is a package module that imports various mathematical and statistical functions from internal modules for use within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .algebra, .calculus, .geometry, .trigonometry, .statistics, .number_theory, .linear_algebra",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external communication are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports functions and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are evident. The code appears to be straightforward module imports and metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from internal modules, likely part of a mathematical package. There are no inputs from external sources, no data processing, and no external communications or side effects. The metadata variables only specify version and author info. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import structure for a mathematical package, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger, legitimate package.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
