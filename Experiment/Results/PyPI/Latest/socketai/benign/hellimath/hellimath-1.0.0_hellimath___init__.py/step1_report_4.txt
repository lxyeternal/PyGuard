{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package initialization file that imports various mathematical and statistical functions from different modules, setting metadata for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions from local modules (algebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, number_theory, linear_algebra).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data; the code only performs imports and metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules, presumably part of the same package, and sets package metadata variables. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data handling from untrusted sources, or suspicious patterns. The structure and content are consistent with typical package setup files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It simply imports functions for use elsewhere and defines package metadata.",
