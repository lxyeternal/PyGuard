{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index or aggregation module that imports various mathematical functions from different submodules within a package, likely for use in a larger scientific or mathematical application.",
  "sources": "Imports from submodules such as .algebra, .calculus, .geometry, .trigonometry, .statistics, .number_theory, and .linear_algebra. These are source points where the code reads functions for later use.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks in this code. No network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions from internal submodules for use within the package. No untrusted data input or external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior. The only potentially sensitive data are the metadata variables (__version__ and __author__), which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import aggregation module, importing various mathematical functions from internal submodules. It contains no network operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The metadata variables are standard and do not pose any security concern. The structure is clear and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer that aggregates imports from internal submodules. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code snippet.",
