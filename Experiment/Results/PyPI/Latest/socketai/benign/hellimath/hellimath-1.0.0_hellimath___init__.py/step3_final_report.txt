  "purpose": "Aggregate internal mathematical functions and define package metadata for a Python module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal submodules; metadata variables (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and metadata assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module aggregator that imports functions from internal modules and sets metadata. No network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure is typical and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with high confidence, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
