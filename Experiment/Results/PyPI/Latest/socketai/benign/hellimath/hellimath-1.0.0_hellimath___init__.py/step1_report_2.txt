{
  "purpose": "The code imports mathematical functions from various modules within a package, serving as an API for mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as algebra, calculus, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, number_theory, and linear_algebra.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data processing; only module imports and metadata definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and assigns metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file that imports various mathematical functions from internal modules. It only defines metadata variables (__version__, __author__). There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
