      "conclusion": "The Python code is standard and free of malicious or obfuscated content. However, executing an external script ('install.sh') during setup without validation introduces a significant supply chain security risk. The overall malware risk is low, but the potential for malicious activity depends entirely on the trustworthiness of 'install.sh'. To mitigate this, checksum verification or signature validation of the script is recommended. The current scores appropriately reflect these considerations."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code facilitates remote script download and execution without validation, representing a significant supply chain security risk. It is not malicious by itself but can be exploited to run malicious code. The overall security concern is high, primarily due to the lack of integrity verification of external scripts. The malware score should be moderate (~0.6), and the security risk score should be high (~0.8), consistent with the potential for malicious payload execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward installer launcher with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security posture depends on the implementation of run_install_script(), which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
