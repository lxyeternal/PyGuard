  "conclusion": "The code facilitates remote script download and execution without validation, representing a significant supply chain security risk. It is not malicious by itself but can be exploited to run malicious code. The overall security concern is high, primarily due to the lack of integrity verification of external scripts. The malware score should be moderate (~0.6), and the security risk score should be high (~0.8), consistent with the potential for malicious payload execution."
