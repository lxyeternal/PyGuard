  "purpose": "Download and execute platform-specific installation scripts from a remote repository if not already present locally.",
  "sources": "URL for downloading install.sh from GitHub; reading platform.system(); checking for file existence; reading script_path for execution.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() for executing downloaded scripts; requests.get() for fetching remote scripts.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote script content; script saved locally; subprocess.run() executes the script file.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically constructs command to execute scripts based on OS; downloads and executes scripts from external source without validation; no checksum or signature verification; potentially risky if the remote script is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a shell script from a GitHub URL if it does not exist locally, then executes it depending on the OS platform. The download is done via requests without validation, and execution is performed via subprocess without sandboxing or additional security checks. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the remote script, which could allow malicious scripts to be executed if the remote source is compromised. The code handles different platforms but does not sanitize or validate scripts beyond existence check. The use of subprocess.run() with external scripts constitutes a significant execution risk if the source is malicious. There are no obfuscation signs or hidden behaviors. Overall, the script's behavior poses a security risk due to remote code execution without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes external scripts from a remote URL without validation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if the remote script is compromised. The core risk is remote code execution without verification, representing a security concern.",
