  "flows": "Not demonstrated in the snippet; would involve reading external data and executing commands or scripts.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet provided is only a docstring and metadata without actual implementation. No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of a descriptive comment, version, and author metadata, with no executable code. No sources, sinks, or flows are visible. Without additional code, there are no apparent security concerns. The description suggests automation of downloads and installation, which could be risky if implemented insecurely, but that is not shown here.",
