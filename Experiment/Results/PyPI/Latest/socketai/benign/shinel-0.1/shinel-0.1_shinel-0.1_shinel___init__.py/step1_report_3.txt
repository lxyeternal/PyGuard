  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as an installer package for Combot, a terminal assistant, by automating the download and installation process.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources are shown in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code fragment; there are no operations that process untrusted data or perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only contains metadata variables (__version__ and __author__) without any active code, functions, or execution logic. No suspicious or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of descriptive comments and two metadata variables. It does not include any functions, system calls, network operations, or data processing. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The description suggests that the actual installation process is automated elsewhere, but no such logic is included in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package metadata definition without active or suspicious code.",
