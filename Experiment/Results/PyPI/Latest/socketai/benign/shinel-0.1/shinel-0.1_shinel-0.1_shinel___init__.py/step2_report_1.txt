  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the context.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippet is purely metadata: a comment describing the package purpose, version, and author.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or code execution present.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of active code or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- The security risk scores are low or zero, consistent with the minimal content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is benign, only metadata.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also accurate; only descriptive docstring and metadata.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the minimal content.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no active code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; metadata only.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, mentions potential risks if code were implemented elsewhere, but the snippet itself is harmless.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating given no code present.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, though a bit conservative.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippet, which is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The slight difference in security risk score in report 5 is acceptable, considering potential risks if the code is extended elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — minimal risk given the current code; if the actual installer logic is added elsewhere, risk could increase, but based on this snippet alone, it remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and cautious, and the scores align well with the code content. No changes are necessary.",
