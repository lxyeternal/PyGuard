  "purpose": "Metadata describing the Combot Installer package, including version and author information.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only module-level variables and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code contains only static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or external calls; only descriptive comments and variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with a descriptive docstring and two variables (__version__ and __author__). There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or executable logic. This indicates a benign, informational module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The lack of obfuscation and external interactions further supports its safety. The minimal content aligns with a standard package metadata file, and no anomalies or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only descriptive metadata with no active or suspicious elements. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all appropriately zero. The overall assessment confirms no malicious intent or security concerns within this snippet.",
