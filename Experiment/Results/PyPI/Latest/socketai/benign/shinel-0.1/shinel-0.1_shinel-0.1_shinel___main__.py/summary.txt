  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward installer launcher with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security posture depends on the implementation of run_install_script(), which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
