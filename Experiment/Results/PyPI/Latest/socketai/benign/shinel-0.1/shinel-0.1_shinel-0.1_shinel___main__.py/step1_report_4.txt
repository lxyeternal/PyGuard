{
  "purpose": "To provide a command-line entry point for executing the installation script of the LingoShell package.",
  "sources": "The code reads user execution (via __main__), and imports the run_install_script function from a local installer module.",
  "sinks": "The run_install_script function is invoked, which could execute arbitrary installation commands or scripts.",
  "flows": "User runs the script -> __main__ triggers main() -> main() calls run_install_script() from installer module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The function run_install_script's contents are unknown, which could be a concern if malicious, but it is a standard pattern to delegate to another script.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple CLI launcher that calls a function from a local module. There are no embedded secrets or suspicious code patterns directly visible. The security risk hinges on the contents of run_install_script, which is external to this snippet. Without inspecting that function, the code itself appears benign. The code is straightforward and typical for installation procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as an installer launcher without any obvious malicious behavior. The security concern depends entirely on the implementation of run_install_script in the installer module. Based on this code alone, there is no malware or malicious intent detected.",
