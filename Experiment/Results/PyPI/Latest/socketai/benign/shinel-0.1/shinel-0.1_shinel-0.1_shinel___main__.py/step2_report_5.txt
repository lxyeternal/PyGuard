  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `run_install_script` from a local module `.installer`.\n- It defines a `main()` function that prints a message and calls `run_install_script()`.\n- When executed as a script, it invokes `main()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself is minimal and straightforward.\n- It merely delegates execution to `run_install_script()`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The security risk and malware scores are all set to zero, indicating no malicious intent or behavior is evident in this fragment.\n\n**Note:** The actual security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `run_install_script()`, which is external to this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that the security posture hinges on the implementation of `run_install_script()`.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning; the analysis appropriately states that the code is benign and standard for an installer launcher.\n- The reports do not assume malicious behavior without evidence and acknowledge the dependency on external code.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code being benign.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern based solely on this code snippet.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The main concern is the behavior of `run_install_script()`. Since its implementation is unknown, the actual risk cannot be fully assessed.\n- If `run_install_script()` executes arbitrary or malicious commands, the risk would be significant, but this cannot be determined from the current code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1-0.2 (low, assuming standard installer behavior)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical entry point for an installer, with no suspicious features. The security implications depend on the external function, which isn't part of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. They correctly identify that the core code is benign and that the main risk lies in the implementation of `run_install_script()`. Without additional context or inspection of that function, there is no reason to assign higher malware or risk scores.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and assign a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the dependence on external code for actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized conclusion or further analyze potential external risks?**",
