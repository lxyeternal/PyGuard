{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for manually running an installer script for the LingoShell application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'run_install_script' from a local module 'installer'. It reads nothing directly from user input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "The 'run_install_script()' function is called, which may execute arbitrary installation commands. The code prints a message to the console.",
  "flows": "The flow is: the main() function is invoked, which calls run_install_script(), potentially executing installer logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior are present. Dependence on external 'installer' module is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point wrapper that calls an installation function. Since the actual install logic resides in 'run_install_script', potential risks depend on its implementation. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign entry point for an installer process. Without analyzing 'run_install_script', no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The code appears to be standard and safe.",
