  "flows": "The script executes run_install_script() when run as main, initiating installer procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and executes it in a main guard. There are no signs of obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious logic. The run_install_script() function's behavior is unknown but based solely on this code, it appears to be a standard installer invocation. No data leakage, malicious commands, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign launcher for an installer script. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on the provided snippet.",
