  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal script that imports `run_install_script` from a local module `.installer` and calls it within a `main()` function, which is invoked if the script is run as the main module. It contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for installer.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code delegates to `run_install_script`. It emphasizes that the security depends on the implementation of that function.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the minimal code and no apparent malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for installer.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing reliance on `run_install_script`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is reasonable. The very low security risk and malware scores are justified. The high confidence reflects the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for installer.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern, noting that the code is benign and the risk depends on the external function.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** CLI launcher for installer.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the actual risk depends on `run_install_script`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. The risk score remains low, as expected.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Simple installer launcher.\n- **Analysis:** Same as others, emphasizing dependence on external function.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code itself is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the security posture depends on `run_install_script`. They do not assume malicious intent without evidence. No false positives or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are reasonable given the code. Malware scores are 0 across the board, reflecting no malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low, aligning with the minimal code and the unknown nature of the external function.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  Since the code only delegates to an external function, the risk assessment hinges on that function's implementation. Without inspecting `run_install_script`, the scores should remain low. Any higher scores would be unjustified unless there was evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  No evidence of malicious activity in this code snippet.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2  \n  Slightly higher than the reports in some cases, but still very low, given the dependence on an external function.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard installer launcher with no intrinsic malicious or obfuscated elements. The security concern is entirely external, dependent on the implementation of `run_install_script`. Given the evidence, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the assessments and justifies a cautious but confident stance that the code itself is benign.",
