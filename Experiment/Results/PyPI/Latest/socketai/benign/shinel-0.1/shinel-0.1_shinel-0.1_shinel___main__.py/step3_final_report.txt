{
  "purpose": "A minimal script that serves as an entry point to run an installer by invoking run_install_script() from a local module.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input; it imports run_install_script from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The script calls run_install_script(), which could be a sink if it executes malicious code, but the script itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: main() prints a message and calls run_install_script(), which is external.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, clear, and follows standard patterns for an installer launcher.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic launcher that delegates to run_install_script(). No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The security and maliciousness depend entirely on the implementation of run_install_script(), which is not provided. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest low inherent risk. The reports correctly identify that the main concern is the external function. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the external dependency. Confidence in the benign nature of this code is high, given its straightforward structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward installer launcher with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security posture depends on the implementation of run_install_script(), which cannot be assessed here. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
