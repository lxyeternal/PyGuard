{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'shinel' Python package, including custom post-install script execution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and script path; reads 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'install.sh' script via subprocess; modifies file permissions; potentially executes external code.",
  "flows": "Reads 'install.sh' path -> changes permissions -> executes the script during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs an external shell script ('install.sh') during post-install, which could contain malicious commands; no validation or restrictions on script contents; no sanitization or checks before execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install command. During installation, it constructs the path to 'install.sh', makes it executable, and runs it via subprocess. This external script execution during package installation presents a risk if 'install.sh' is malicious or tampered with. Dependencies are standard and do not contain suspicious patterns. No other suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be standard for package setup but executes an external shell script during post-install. If 'install.sh' is compromised or malicious, it can execute arbitrary commands, posing significant security risks. The code does not validate or restrict script contents, making this a potential supply chain security vulnerability.",
