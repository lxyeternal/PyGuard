{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and executes an external shell script ('install.sh') during post-installation without validation, posing a supply chain security risk.",
  "sources": "The script reads the 'install.sh' file from the 'inst' directory, constructs its path dynamically, and executes it via subprocess.check_call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'install.sh' via subprocess, which can lead to arbitrary command execution if the script is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the script path, sets executable permissions, and runs the script without validation, allowing potential malicious commands within 'install.sh' to execute during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code embedded in the Python script; the main anomaly is executing an external script without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard setup boilerplate that executes an external script ('install.sh') during post-installation. The script path is dynamically constructed, permissions are set, and it is run via subprocess without any checksum or signature verification. This pattern introduces a supply chain risk if 'install.sh' is malicious or compromised. The Python code itself is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk stems from external trust assumptions. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting no malicious code in the Python script, but the security risk score is higher (around 0.6) due to unvalidated external script execution.",
  "conclusion": "The Python code is standard and free of malicious or obfuscated content. However, executing an external script ('install.sh') during setup without validation introduces a significant supply chain security risk. The overall malware risk is low, but the potential for malicious activity depends entirely on the trustworthiness of 'install.sh'. To mitigate this, checksum verification or signature validation of the script is recommended. The current scores appropriately reflect these considerations.",
