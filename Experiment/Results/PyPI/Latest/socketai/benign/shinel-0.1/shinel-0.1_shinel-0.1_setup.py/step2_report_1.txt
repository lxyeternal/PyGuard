  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the core concern is the execution of an external shell script ('install.sh') during the post-installation phase.\n- The Python code itself is standard boilerplate for package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The execution of 'install.sh' via subprocess without validation or sanitization is the main risk factor.\n- No evidence suggests the presence of malware, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets within the Python code itself.\n- The security risk hinges entirely on the content and integrity of 'install.sh', which is external and unverified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code executes an external shell script ('install.sh') during post-installation.\n- The script path is constructed dynamically, and the script is made executable before execution.\n- No validation, checksum, or signature verification of 'install.sh' is performed.\n- This pattern is risky because if 'install.sh' is malicious or tampered with, it can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Lack of validation:** No checksum or signature verification for 'install.sh'.\n- **Potential for malicious code execution:** Running external scripts during setup without validation is dangerous.\n- **No sandboxing or restrictions:** The script runs with the permissions of the install process, which could be elevated.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.2, 0.25). Given the code itself is benign but executes an external script, a malware score of 0.25 seems reasonable if the script is trusted. However, if the script is untrusted, the malware risk could be higher.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, correct, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.4 to 0.6. Given the external execution without validation, a score of 0.6 (highest among reports) is justified if the script is untrusted; otherwise, 0.4 is acceptable if assuming trusted scripts.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The **risk score** should reflect the potential for malicious behavior if 'install.sh' is compromised. Since the code does not validate or verify the script, and executing external scripts during install is inherently risky, a **risk score of 0.6** is justified if the trustworthiness of 'install.sh' is unknown.\n- If 'install.sh' is trusted and maintained securely, a lower score (around 0.4) might be appropriate.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports assume 'install.sh' could be malicious, which is valid given the lack of validation.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code within the Python code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.2–0.3 (since no malicious code is in the Python code itself, but external script execution is risky).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk:** 0.6 (high, due to execution of external script without validation).\n\n**Critical point:** The main concern is **trustworthiness** of 'install.sh'. If the package source or the environment is untrusted, the risk increases significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is standard setup boilerplate.\n- The execution of an external script ('install.sh') during installation is a supply chain risk.\n- No malware or obfuscation detected in the code itself.\n- The risk level depends on the trustworthiness of 'install.sh'.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (assuming the script is benign but unverified).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.6 (high, due to unvalidated external script execution).\n\n**Final note:** For improved security, consider adding checksum verification, signature validation, or sandboxing for 'install.sh'.",
