  "conclusion": "The Python code is standard and free of malicious or obfuscated content. However, executing an external script ('install.sh') during setup without validation introduces a significant supply chain security risk. The overall malware risk is low, but the potential for malicious activity depends entirely on the trustworthiness of 'install.sh'. To mitigate this, checksum verification or signature validation of the script is recommended. The current scores appropriately reflect these considerations."
