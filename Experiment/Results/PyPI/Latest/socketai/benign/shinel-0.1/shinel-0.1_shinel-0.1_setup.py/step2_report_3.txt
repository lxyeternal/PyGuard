  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports agree that the code executes an external shell script ('install.sh') during post-installation via subprocess.\n- The script path is constructed dynamically, and the script is made executable before execution.\n- No validation, checksum, or sandboxing is performed on 'install.sh'.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the external script execution as a potential security concern.\n- They correctly note that the code itself is standard setup boilerplate, with the main risk stemming from executing an unvalidated external script.\n- No report mentions that the script's content is inspected or validated, which is a significant oversight if the script is malicious.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues:**\n- All reports assign malware scores between 0 and 0.25, reflecting minimal or no malicious activity detected in the Python code itself.\n- Security risk scores vary from 0.4 to 0.6, appropriately higher given the external script execution.\n- These scores seem reasonable, considering the code's behavior.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The reports assign a security risk of up to 0.6, justified by the execution of an external script during installation, which can be malicious if the script is compromised.\n- Since the code executes an external script without validation, the risk is indeed significant, especially in supply chain contexts.\n\n**5. Malware scores:**\n- All reports assign malware scores close to zero, which is appropriate because the Python code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n- However, the malware risk could be higher if the external script is malicious, but since its content isn't inspected, the low malware score is justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly assume that the external script could be malicious but do not claim it is malicious definitively.\n- They highlight the risk but refrain from labeling the package as malicious without evidence.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, moderate security risk due to external script execution.\n- No contradictions are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code security evaluation:**\n- The core issue is executing an external script ('install.sh') during package installation without validation.\n- This pattern is a known supply chain risk, as malicious or compromised scripts can execute arbitrary commands.\n- The Python code itself is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 to 0.1 (since no malicious code is in the Python script itself)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.7 (due to executing unvalidated external scripts during installation)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The main concern is the external script execution during setup, which can be exploited if 'install.sh' is malicious.\n- The code should ideally validate or checksum the script before execution.\n- The current setup is a supply chain vulnerability if the script source isn't trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code itself is benign but introduces a significant security risk by executing an external, unvalidated shell script during installation. The malware score remains low, but the security risk is moderate to high depending on trust in 'install.sh'. Proper validation or sandboxing should be implemented to mitigate this risk.",
