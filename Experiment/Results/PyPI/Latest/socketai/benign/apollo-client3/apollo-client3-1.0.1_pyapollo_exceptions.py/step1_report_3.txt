  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python programs.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; exception messages are passed as strings during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or outputs beyond printing or returning strings.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines classes without complex data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The BasicException class prints the message during initialization, which is unconventional and may cause unwanted side effects. The __str__ method references an attribute __name__, which is not defined; it should likely be self.__class__.__name__.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException. The BasicException class prints the message upon creation, which is unusual for exception classes, but not inherently malicious. The __str__ method attempts to return a string including __name__, which does not exist, indicating a probable bug. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed, and no suspicious behaviors like network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with a minor bug in __str__, no malicious intent or security risks detected. The printing in constructor is unconventional but not malicious.",
