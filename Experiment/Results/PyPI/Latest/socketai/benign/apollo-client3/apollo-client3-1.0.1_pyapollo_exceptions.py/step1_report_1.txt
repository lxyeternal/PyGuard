  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python applications.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code does not read any input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines classes without data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The __str__ method attempts to access self.__name__, which is undefined, leading to a runtime AttributeError. The print statement in the constructor outputs messages directly to stdout, which may be undesirable but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException. The BasicException class prints a message upon instantiation, which is a side effect unrelated to security. The __str__ method references self.__name__, which does not exist in the class context, leading to a potential runtime error rather than malicious behavior. No external data input, data leakage, or malicious code present. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward exception class definition with a minor implementation flaw.",
  "conclusion": "This code is not malicious. It contains a minor bug in the __str__ method, but no malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The code serves a simple purpose of defining custom exceptions.",
