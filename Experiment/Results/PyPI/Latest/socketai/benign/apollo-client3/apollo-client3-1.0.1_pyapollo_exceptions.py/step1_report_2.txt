  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with custom messages.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines classes and does not execute data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The BasicException class prints the message upon initialization, which can be considered a side effect, but this is not inherently malicious. The use of __name__ in __str__ without defining or setting it may cause an error if __name__ is undefined within the class context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException. The BasicException class prints the message when instantiated, which is unusual but not malicious. The __str__ method attempts to format using self.__name__, which is not set anywhere, likely causing an AttributeError if __str__ is called. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple exception class definitions with a minor issue in the __str__ method (use of undefined self.__name__). There are no malicious behaviors, malware, or security risks identified. The only concern is a potential runtime error in the __str__ method, but it does not pose security risks.",
