  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and printing messages",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted sources",
  "sinks": "Printing messages to stdout in the BasicException class",
  "flows": "Exception initialization leads to message being printed directly to stdout",
  "anomalies": "Printing in exception constructor may expose sensitive information if exceptions contain secrets (not evident here). No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException. The BasicException class prints the message upon instantiation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external input reading, no suspicious data flow, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The exception message is stored and printed, which could reveal internal messages if used improperly, but nothing explicitly malicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with printing behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The only minor concern is printing exception messages directly, which could leak information if used improperly, but this is not inherently malicious.",
