  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Input source is not explicitly present; code does not read external data but defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output beyond class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to output; class methods simply store and print messages.",
  "anomalies": "The __str__ method attempts to access self.__name__, which is undefined for the class, indicating a potential bug.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException. The BasicException class prints the message upon instantiation and attempts to return a string including __name__, which is not defined for instances of the class, likely causing an AttributeError. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The classes serve standard exception handling purposes. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious activities are apparent. The primary concern is a bug in __str__ method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition with a minor bug in __str__. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
