  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only an import statement, no execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code beyond import; insufficient information for anomalies or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a third-party or local module named 'apollo_client'. No further logic, data handling, or network activity is visible. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent; it is a common pattern for GraphQL client interactions. Without additional context or code, there are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, only importing a module, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious activities are evident based solely on this snippet.",
