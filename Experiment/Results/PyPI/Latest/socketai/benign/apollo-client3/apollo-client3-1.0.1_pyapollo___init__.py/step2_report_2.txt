  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Code content:** Only an import statement (`from apollo_client import ApolloClient`).\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — minimal, perhaps slightly overestimating risk for such a benign snippet, but acceptable.\n  - Confidence: 1 — justified given the clear, minimal code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Code content:** Same as above, only an import statement.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior, minimal code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Confidence: 0.4 — slightly lower, reflecting less certainty, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Code content:** Same minimal import.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — suitable.\n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high confidence in benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Code content:** Same import statement.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — slightly elevated but acceptable given the minimal context.\n  - Confidence: 0.6 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Code content:** Same import statement.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 — suitable.\n  - Confidence: 0.5 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- All reports analyze the same minimal code snippet.\n- None identify any actual malicious activity, suspicious patterns, or embedded secrets.\n- The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, though some overestimate minimal risk (e.g., 0.1 security risk for such a benign import).\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correct at 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Given the code is just an import, a score of 0 or very close to it is more appropriate. Slightly elevated scores (like 0.1) are acceptable but could be lowered for more precision.\n- **Confidence levels:** Slightly varied but generally justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n- The code snippet is benign, straightforward, and common in Python projects.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The risk scores could be lowered to 0 in some cases, but the current scores are not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be closer to 0, perhaps 0.0 or 0.1, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their reasoning. The scores are mostly appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the extremely low risk associated with such minimal, benign import statements.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (leaning towards 0 for such minimal code)",
