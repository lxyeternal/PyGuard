  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only an import statement of `ApolloClient` from an `apollo_client` module.\n- No additional code, data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is presented.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malware or security risks detected.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.4 to 1, reflecting some uncertainty, but generally indicating low suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports are accurate in stating that the code snippet only contains an import statement. There are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based solely on this snippet.\n- **No issues to confirm or deny beyond what is stated.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate given the minimal code. They correctly note the lack of data flow, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**However:**\n- The report scores are somewhat conservative, especially given the minimal code. Since the code is just an import, a score of 0 or near 0 for malware and security risk is reasonable.\n- The confidence scores are mostly appropriate, though some are slightly lower, reflecting the limited context.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- None of the code snippets or reports justify a risk score above 0.5, as there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern could be if this import is part of a larger, malicious payload, but that cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and challenges:\n- The malware scores are consistent with the reports.\n- The security risk scores are also consistent, given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, given just an import statement)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nConsidering all reports and the minimal code snippet, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just an import, no activity)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is benign, and the reports are accurate. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based solely on this import statement.",
