  "purpose": "Importing the ApolloClient class from the apollo_client module, likely to interact with Apollo GraphQL APIs or services.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ApolloClient from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; code only shows an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code provided; no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class from an external module named apollo_client. There are no other operations, data inputs, or outputs. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The import itself is standard practice for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with no suspicious activity.",
