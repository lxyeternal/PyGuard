No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or embedded secrets are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Confidence levels are justified given the simplicity of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
