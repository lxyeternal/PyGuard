  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only an import statement of `ApolloClient` from `apollo_client`.\n- No additional code, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code snippets are minimal and do not exhibit any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.\n- The overall security risk for each snippet is very low, which aligns with the absence of any malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-Report Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign. Importing a known library for GraphQL interaction is common. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity or security issues. The confidence is somewhat lower (0.4), but given the minimal code, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; only an import statement with no other logic. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct; minimal code, benign import, no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct; straightforward import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; the scores are consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the minimal code and lack of any suspicious behavior, all risk scores are appropriately low, with some variation based on confidence levels.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is only an import statement, the highest possible malware score should remain 0.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are reasonable, considering the limited code context.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports (confirmed no malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports, as the code snippet alone poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided code snippets. No adjustments are necessary.",
