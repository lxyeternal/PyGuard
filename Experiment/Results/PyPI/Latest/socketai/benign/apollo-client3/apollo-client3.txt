      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation of custom exception classes with a minor bug in __str__. There is no malicious intent or malicious code. The bug may cause runtime errors but does not pose a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is around 0.2 due to the bug and side effects. Fixing the __str__ method to use self.__class__.__name__ would prevent runtime errors. Overall, the code is safe in a supply chain context, with a minor bug affecting stability but no security concerns."
