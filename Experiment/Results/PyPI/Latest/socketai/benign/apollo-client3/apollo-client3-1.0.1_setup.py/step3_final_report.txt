{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; no untrusted input sources or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Reads 'README.md' without error handling, which could cause runtime errors if the file is missing, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports only setuptools, calls setup() with package metadata, and reads a README file without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious commands are present. The only minor issue is the lack of error handling when opening 'README.md', which is common and benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score. The minor point about error handling does not impact security or functionality significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. All assessments are accurate; the code is safe and straightforward.",
