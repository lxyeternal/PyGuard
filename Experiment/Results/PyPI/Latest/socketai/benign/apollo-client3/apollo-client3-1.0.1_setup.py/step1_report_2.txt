  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'apollo-client3'.",
  "sources": "Reading the package description from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; external dependencies are listed but not executed or fetched dynamically.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flow from sources to sinks; the setup process is standard.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without error handling may lead to runtime error if the file is missing, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, author information, and classifiers. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' without error handling, which is common and not malicious. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The dependencies are not dynamically fetched or executed; the setup process is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears safe for use in packaging the project.",
