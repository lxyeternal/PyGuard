  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'apollo-client3', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long_description; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs a standard setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, author info, and classifiers. It reads the README.md file for detailed description, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, no reading of environment variables, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns are present. All parts serve the purpose of configuring a Python package release.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and standard.",
