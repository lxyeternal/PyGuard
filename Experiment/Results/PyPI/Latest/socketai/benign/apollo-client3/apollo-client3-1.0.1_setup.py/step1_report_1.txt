{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'apollo-client3' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including reading from 'README.md' to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is purely declarative configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code follows standard package setup practices without suspicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with typical parameters for package distribution. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or external network operations are present. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious commands. The structure is straightforward, targeting package metadata. The only file access is reading a markdown file, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only contains package metadata and standard setup instructions.",
