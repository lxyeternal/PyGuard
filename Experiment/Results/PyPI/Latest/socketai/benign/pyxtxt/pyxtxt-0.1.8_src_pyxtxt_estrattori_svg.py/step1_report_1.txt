{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract all text content from SVG files provided as input buffers.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_buffer' which is parsed as an XML document using lxml.etree.parse()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code reads input data but does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'file_buffer' into 'etree.parse()', then into 'root.findall()' for extraction",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Exception handling only logs errors; no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and the 'lxml' library to parse SVG files. It attempts to parse the provided buffer as an XML document and extract text from '<text>' tags within SVG namespace. The exception handling only prints errors and returns an empty string. No untrusted command execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical SVG text extraction procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a simple extraction of text from SVG files without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious data flows.",
