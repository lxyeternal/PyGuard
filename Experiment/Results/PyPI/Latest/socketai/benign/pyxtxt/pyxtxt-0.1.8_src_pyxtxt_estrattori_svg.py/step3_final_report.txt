  "purpose": "Extracts text content from SVG files by parsing the XML and retrieving all <text> elements within the SVG namespace.",
  "sources": "Reads the entire SVG file buffer and parses it as an XML document.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily reads data from the input buffer.",
  "flows": "Input buffer -> XML parser -> Finds <text> elements -> Extracts text -> Joins and returns.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exception handling with print for errors; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward SVG text extraction by parsing the input buffer as XML, locating all <text> elements within the SVG namespace, and returning their combined text. Exception handling is minimal and only logs errors. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Potential security considerations include resource exhaustion if parsing maliciously crafted SVGs, but this is a common XML parsing risk and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SVG text extractor with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only concern is resource exhaustion from malicious input, which justifies a very low security risk score. Overall, it is safe for use.",
