{
  "purpose": "The code extracts text content from SVG files provided as input buffers.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_buffer' used in 'etree.parse(file_buffer)' which reads SVG file data.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes data internally; no external sinks are present. However, if the 'file_buffer' is untrusted, parsing could lead to resource exhaustion or errors.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_buffer' flows into 'etree.parse', then the root element is processed to extract text from <text> tags. The extracted text is returned as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies detected; standard SVG parsing and text extraction. The exception handling only logs errors locally.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and registers an SVG extractor function. The function 'xtxt_svg' parses the SVG file buffer to find all <text> elements within the SVG namespace and joins their text content for output. The use of 'etree.parse' on untrusted input could theoretically cause resource exhaustion if the input is maliciously crafted, but no malicious behavior or data leakage is evident. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SVG text extractor with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple parsing and data extraction without external communication or side effects. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
