{
  "purpose": "Extracts all text content from SVG files by parsing XML structure using lxml.etree.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'file_buffer' parameter passed to the 'xtxt_svg' function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems or used in potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'file_buffer' into 'etree.parse', then extracts text elements, and returns concatenated text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior observed. Exception handling only logs errors locally.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module for registration and a parsing library, then defines a function to parse SVG files. It extracts text content from SVG XML tags, handling exceptions gracefully. The function is registered as an extractor for SVG MIME type. No malicious or suspicious activity is present; the code is straightforward and intended for safe text extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SVG text extraction utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs XML parsing and text extraction without external communications or sensitive operations.",
