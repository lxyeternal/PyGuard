  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `register_extractor` from the current package.\n- Defines `xtxt_txt(file_buffer)` that reads the entire buffer and decodes it as UTF-8, ignoring errors.\n- Registers this function for MIME type `'text/plain'` with the name `'TXT'`.\n\n**Security & Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward: a function that reads and decodes file data.\n- No network activity, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No suspicious imports or behaviors.\n- The only notable aspect is the relative import, which is common in modular codebases and not inherently suspicious.\n- No signs of malware, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Conclusion: Benign plugin registration, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — **appropriate**.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — justified.\n- Confidence: 1 — well-supported.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar reasoning; straightforward registration.\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), possibly due to noting the relative import.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — perhaps overestimating; the code is simple.\n- Justification: No malicious intent, just a registration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to others; straightforward.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion; no malicious signs.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, all should have a low risk score, ideally 0 or very close to it.\n\n**However,** some reports assign a small security risk (e.g., 0.1). Since the code is trivial and safe, I would argue for a **risk score of 0** across the board.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard plugin registration for text extraction.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores should reflect the benign nature: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| All reports | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent in their assessments, but the assigned risk scores could be lowered to zero. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero.",
