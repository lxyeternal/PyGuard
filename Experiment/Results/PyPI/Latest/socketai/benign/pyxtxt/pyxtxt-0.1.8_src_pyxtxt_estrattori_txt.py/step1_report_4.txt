{
  "purpose": "Register a file extractor for 'text/plain' files that decodes file buffer content as UTF-8 text.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'file_buffer' object via 'file_buffer.read()'.",
  "sinks": "The decoded text is returned; no external sinks or data transmission occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'file_buffer.read()' to decoding, then to return value; no external or untrusted data flows beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a registration function, defines a simple function to read and decode file buffer data as UTF-8, and registers this extractor under the name 'TXT'. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for file processing. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform network operations, store sensitive data insecurely, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic file extractor registration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides a mechanism to decode text files, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
