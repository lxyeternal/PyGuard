  "purpose": "Register a text extractor function for handling 'text/plain' MIME type in a larger processing framework.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'file_buffer' object via its 'read()' method.",
  "sinks": "Decodes the input data using UTF-8, potential for data leakage if mishandled elsewhere, but no direct sink actions present.",
  "flows": "Data read from 'file_buffer' -> decoded as UTF-8 string in 'xtxt_txt' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The 'register_extractor' function is imported relatively, which is common in package modules; no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'register_extractor' function, defines 'xtxt_txt' to read and decode file buffer data as UTF-8, and registers this function for 'text/plain' MIME type with a name 'TXT'. The process is straightforward, typical for a plugin or extension system. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only notable point is the relative import, which is common in package modules, not inherently suspicious. Overall, the code appears to serve a standard data handling purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code registers a simple text extraction function with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs basic file reading and decoding, which is standard in data processing pipelines.",
