  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward registration of a text file extractor function.\n- It reads from a file buffer, decodes as UTF-8, and registers via `register_extractor`.\n- No network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- The import is relative, which is common in package modules and not suspicious.\n- The function does not perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or handling secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Benign plugin registration, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Simple text extractor, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard registration, minimal security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Note:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) due to the relative import, but this is standard in package modules and not inherently risky.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, no reason to increase risk score beyond 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Basic file decoder registration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Simple, benign registration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.\n- The risk scores assigned are mostly zero, with a minor 0.1 in report 3, which is reasonable given the relative import but not indicative of a security risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, as the code performs a benign function.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment, and the code is clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard plugin registration for text extraction, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
