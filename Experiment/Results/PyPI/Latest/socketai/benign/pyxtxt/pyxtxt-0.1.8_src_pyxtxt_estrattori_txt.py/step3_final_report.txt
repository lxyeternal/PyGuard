  "purpose": "Register a text file extractor function for MIME type 'text/plain' within a package framework.",
  "sources": "file_buffer.read() reading input data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration or external communication",
  "flows": "file_buffer.read() -> decode('utf-8')",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward read and decode operation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a registration function, defines a simple function that reads and decodes a buffer as UTF-8, and registers it for a specific MIME type. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The relative import is typical in modular codebases. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate benign intent. The minor security concern related to the relative import is common and not inherently risky. The overall security risk score should be 0, malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and confidence 1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin registration for processing text files, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports' scores are appropriate; the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
