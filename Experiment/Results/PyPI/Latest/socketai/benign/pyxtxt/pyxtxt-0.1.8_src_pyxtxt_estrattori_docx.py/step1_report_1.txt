{
  "purpose": "To extract text content from DOCX files provided as a file buffer.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file_buffer input, which is a file-like object containing the DOCX file data.",
  "sinks": "Uses the io.BytesIO buffer and the 'docx' library to process and parse the file content; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "file_buffer.seek(0) -> file_buffer.read() -> buffer_copy = io.BytesIO(data) -> zipfile.is_zipfile(buffer_copy) -> Document(buffer_copy) -> extract paragraphs' text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard file processing and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to extract text from a DOCX file by copying the input buffer, verifying its format as a ZIP archive, and parsing it with the 'docx' library. It includes proper error handling. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The process relies on standard library functions and a common third-party package, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of DOCX text extraction with appropriate validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
