  "purpose": "Extract text content from PPTX files for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the provided file_buffer, which contains the PPTX file content.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code reads and processes the input buffer but does not write or transmit data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "file_buffer.read() -> Presentation(buffer_copy) -> extract text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies that the input buffer is a valid ZIP file, then loads it as a PowerPoint presentation to extract text from all slides. It includes error handling and prints warnings if invalid input or errors occur. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities are present. The flow is straightforward: read buffer, validate as ZIP, load presentation, extract text.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate function of extracting text from PPTX files without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
