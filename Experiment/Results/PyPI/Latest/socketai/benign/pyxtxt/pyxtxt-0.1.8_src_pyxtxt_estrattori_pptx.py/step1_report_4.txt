  "purpose": "Extracts text content from PPTX presentation files provided as byte streams.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_buffer' which is a binary stream representing the PPTX file.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statements for logging errors and invalid files.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'file_buffer' to verify if it's a ZIP, then loads into Presentation object, and extracts text from slides.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of standard libraries and 'python-pptx' for extraction. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to verify if the input stream is a valid PPTX ZIP archive, then reads and extracts text from slides using 'python-pptx'. Error handling is done via exception catching and logging. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The code functions solely for content extraction without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward PPTX text extraction with standard libraries and no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
