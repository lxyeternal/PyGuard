{
  "purpose": "Extract text content from PPTX files uploaded or provided as file buffers.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input file_buffer, including seeking and reading its content.",
  "sinks": "Uses the file_buffer to create a Presentation object; prints messages to stdout on errors.",
  "flows": "file_buffer.seek(0) -> file_buffer.read() -> io.BytesIO(data) -> zipfile.is_zipfile() -> Presentation() -> extract text from shapes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses print statements for error reporting; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; straightforward processing.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a file buffer, verifies it as a ZIP (PPTX), and extracts text from slides. No external network or system modifications are involved. The code properly handles exceptions. It uses standard libraries and a third-party 'pptx' package without suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. It performs a benign function of PPTX text extraction with appropriate input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for extracting text from PPTX files without any malicious intent or security risks. It handles inputs securely, and no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
