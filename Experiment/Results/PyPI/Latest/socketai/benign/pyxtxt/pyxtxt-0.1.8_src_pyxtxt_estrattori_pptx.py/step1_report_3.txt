  "purpose": "Extract text content from PPTX presentation files provided as byte streams.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'file_buffer' input, which is a byte stream containing the PPTX file data.",
  "targets": "Processes the byte stream to parse ZIP structure and extract text via the 'Presentation' object.",
  "flows": "Reads byte data from 'file_buffer' -> Checks ZIP validity -> Rewinds and passes data to 'Presentation' -> Extracts text from slides and shapes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard libraries for ZIP handling and presentation parsing. No obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from 'file_buffer', verifies that it is a valid ZIP file (expected for PPTX files), and then uses the 'python-pptx' library to parse and extract text from the presentation slides. Exception handling is present, catching any errors during processing and printing a message. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code functions solely as a file parser and text extractor, with no network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for extracting text from PPTX files. It performs expected operations securely, with appropriate validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
