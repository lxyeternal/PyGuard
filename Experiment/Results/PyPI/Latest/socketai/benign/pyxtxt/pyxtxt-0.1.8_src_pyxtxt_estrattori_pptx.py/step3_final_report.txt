  "purpose": "Extracts text content from PPTX presentation files provided as byte streams.",
  "sources": "Reads input buffer, verifies ZIP format, loads as PPTX, accesses slide shapes with 'text' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily reads data and outputs extracted text.",
  "flows": "Input buffer -> ZIP validation -> PPTX loading -> slide shapes -> text extraction.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward implementation with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical PPTX text extraction by validating the input as a ZIP archive, then loading it with 'python-pptx' and collecting text from all slide shapes. Error handling is via try-except with print statements. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The approach is standard and secure, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The validation method is appropriate but not foolproof, though this does not impact the benign assessment. The code's simplicity and use of well-known libraries suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented PPTX text extractor with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
