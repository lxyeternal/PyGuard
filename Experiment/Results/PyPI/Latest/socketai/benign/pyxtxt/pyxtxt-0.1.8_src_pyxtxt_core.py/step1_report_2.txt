{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify the MIME type of input files or buffers, and extract text content using specific extractors based on MIME type.",
  "sources": "Reading files from disk ('open'), reading from io.BytesIO buffers, reading initial bytes for MIME detection ('magic.Magic.from_buffer')",
  "sinks": "Calling extractors from estrattori dictionary with untrusted input buffers, printing error messages, potentially returning text content",
  "flows": "File input or buffer -> MIME type detection -> MIME type check -> extractor call -> return text",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' for error handling instead of secure logging; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data; dynamic MIME detection is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious string handling; commented-out code does not pose risk.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file and buffer MIME type detection and invokes corresponding extractors for text extraction. It reads data from potentially untrusted files or buffers, determines MIME types, and processes data accordingly. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Error handling relies on print statements, which is not ideal but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is observed. The core risk is in processing untrusted input buffers, but this is expected for such a utility and does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for text extraction with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for MIME type detection and text extraction from files or buffers. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage observed. The only minor concern is the use of print statements for error reporting instead of secure logging, but this does not constitute malicious activity.",
