{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and process different types of files by detecting their MIME types, opening them, and extracting text content using registered extractors.",
  "sources": "File path input (str), BytesIO buffer input, reading from files and buffers, and potentially reading file content to detect MIME types.",
  "sinks": "Calling extractor functions from estrattori with file or buffer objects, possibly passing untrusted data to these functions.",
  "flows": "File path input -> open file -> read data -> create buffer -> detect MIME type -> pass buffer to extractor -> extract text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The print statements could be considered a minor anomaly, but they are typical for debugging and not malicious. No obfuscated code detected. The MIME type detection and handling are standard. The code reads file content into memory, which could be risky with large files, but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and techniques to read files and detect MIME types. It handles multiple input types and chooses extractors based on MIME type. It performs exception handling during file operations and processing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of magic for MIME detection is typical. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward file processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It functions as intended for safe text extraction based on MIME types. No security risks or suspicious anomalies are evident.",
