{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process files of various MIME types, extract text content using registered extractors, and handle different input types such as file paths and byte buffers.",
  "sources": "File path input (open/read from disk), io.BytesIO buffer (read from in-memory bytes), and possibly metadata like mimeType attribute",
  "sinks": "Reading file data from disk or buffers, passing data to extraction functions, printing debug messages",
  "flows": "File path → open/read → mime type detection → extraction function → return text; Buffer → mime type detection → extraction function → return text",
  "anomalies": "The code reads from files and buffers, uses magic to determine MIME types, and logs errors and MIME types. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The presence of print statements is mainly for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles file inputs and buffers, performing MIME type detection and delegating extraction to registered functions. No evident malicious payloads, such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code does not include obfuscated segments or suspicious dynamic code execution. Error handling is straightforward, with exceptions caught and printed. The code maintains standard practices for file and buffer handling, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a file processing utility that detects MIME types and extracts text content. There are no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks. The only minor concern is the use of print statements for debugging, which do not introduce security risks.",
