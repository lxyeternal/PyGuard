  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code reads files from paths or buffers.\n- Uses `magic` to detect MIME types.\n- Maps MIME types to extractor functions in `estrattori`.\n- Calls the appropriate extractor with the file/buffer.\n- Handles errors via print statements.\n- No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- No network activity or malicious behavior evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No significant anomalies; minor print statements.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; straightforward utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of print for error handling, standard MIME detection.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; potential concern about untrusted input buffers, but typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Similar to previous; print statements for debugging.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard MIME detection and extraction.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes reliance on external `estrattori`; no validation of their safety.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code itself is benign; risk depends on external extractors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior in this segment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses `magic` detection, no input validation, prints errors.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity; reliance on external extractors is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No. The code is a standard file processing utility.\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed at **0**; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The reports assign 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about error handling and external dependencies. This seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The code itself does not contain malware, obfuscation, or high security risks.\n- The main concern is reliance on external `estrattori` functions, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is outside the scope of this code segment.\n- The use of print statements for error handling is not ideal but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**   | **0**                   | No malicious activity detected in the code segment.        |\n| **Obfuscated**| **0**                   | Code is clear and straightforward.                          |\n| **Risk**      | **0.2**                 | Minor concerns about error handling and external dependencies; no significant security risk. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk score is appropriately low, reflecting minor operational concerns but no malicious intent.",
