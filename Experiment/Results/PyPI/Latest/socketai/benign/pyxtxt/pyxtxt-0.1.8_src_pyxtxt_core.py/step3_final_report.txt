  "purpose": "Utility for reading files or buffers, detecting MIME types via magic, and delegating extraction to registered functions.",
  "sources": "File path input (open/read), buffer input (read), MIME type detection via magic, external extractor functions in estrattori.",
  "sinks": "External extractor functions, mime type detection, error print statements.",
  "flows": "File path or buffer -> MIME detection -> estrattori[MIME] -> return extracted text.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error handling, reliance on external estrattori functions, no input validation on file_input types.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files or buffers, detects MIME types with magic, and dispatches to external extractor functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling via print is suboptimal but not malicious. External estrattori functions could be malicious, but this is outside the scope. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code handles untrusted input buffers as expected for such utilities. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured file processing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The potential vulnerabilities are minimal and relate to external dependencies and error handling practices, which are common and not inherently dangerous.",
