  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward import statement: `from .core import xtxt, extxt_available_formats`. They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and behavior:\n- The code snippet is a simple import statement.\n- It imports specific variables/functions from a local module named `core`.\n- There are no data flows, network activity, or code execution beyond import.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard Python import syntax, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scoring:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1 (Report 3). Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a score of 0 is appropriate. The 0.1 seems slightly arbitrary and not justified by any evidence.\n\n**Recommendation:** I agree with the assigned scores; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- Since the reports are all consistent and accurate in their assessment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor point is the slight security risk score (0.1) in Report 3, which I believe should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided reports and analysis, **the code is entirely benign**. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard import statement.\n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- Scores are appropriate; minor adjustment to security risk score to 0 for consistency.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or context is needed.",
