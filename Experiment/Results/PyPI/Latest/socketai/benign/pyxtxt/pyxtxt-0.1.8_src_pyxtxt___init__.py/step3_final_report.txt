  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of specific symbols from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'core'.",
  "sinks": "The imported symbols ('xtxt', 'extxt_available_formats') could be used elsewhere in the codebase, but within this snippet, there are no sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing symbols from 'core' into the current namespace; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports agree on its benign nature, noting the absence of data handling, network activity, or code execution. The import statement is standard and syntactically correct. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The potential for misuse depends on how the imported symbols are used elsewhere, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. All assessments and scores are appropriate; no further action is necessary.",
