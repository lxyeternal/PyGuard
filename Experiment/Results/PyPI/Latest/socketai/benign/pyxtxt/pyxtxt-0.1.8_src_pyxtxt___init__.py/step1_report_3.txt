  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions or variables ('xtxt' and 'extxt_available_formats') from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module 'core' within the same package directory, which is being imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks present in this single line of code, as it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; it's an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module, likely part of a larger package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscated elements. Since this is only an import statement, it lacks context that could indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The snippet appears to be a typical package structure code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package's internal structure.",
