  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import statement from a local module 'core' (or '.core'), importing 'xtxt' and 'extxt_available_formats'.\n- None mention any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n- The code snippet is minimal and typical for Python package/module structure.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and all reports agree on benign intent.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, indicating no malicious activity is suspected.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero, which aligns with the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original code provided:\n  ```python\n  from .core import xtxt, extxt_available_formats\n  ```\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external inputs or outputs are involved; it's a static import statement.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- The conclusion that the code is harmless and standard is justified.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The security risk score is 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is suggested.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- While the reports correctly identify this as benign, they mention that if these imported functions are used elsewhere to process untrusted data, there could be security implications. However, based solely on this snippet, no such concerns are warranted.\n- The small variation in confidence levels (some 0.9, some 1.0) is acceptable, given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all the information, the scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard import statement within a Python package/module. No security concerns are present based on this snippet alone.",
