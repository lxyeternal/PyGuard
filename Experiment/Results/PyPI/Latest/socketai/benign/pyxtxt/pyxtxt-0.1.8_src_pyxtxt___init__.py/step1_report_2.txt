  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions or variables ('xtxt' and 'extxt_available_formats') from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves importing functions or variables from 'core', which could potentially be used elsewhere, but this code itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward import statement. No suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module, indicating modular design. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The snippet is standard Python import syntax and shows no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious behavior detected. It does not involve handling untrusted data or executing code that could be harmful.",
