  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .core import xtxt, extxt_available_formats`.\n- The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module named `core`.\n- None of the reports identify any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and malware scores are 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The code snippet is simple and correct Python syntax for importing specific components from a local module.\n- There are no signs of data flow from untrusted sources, no network activity, or code execution.\n- The import statement alone does not pose any security risk.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1; this is acceptable since the code itself doesn't introduce risk but could be part of a larger context where imported functions are used insecurely.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities that would justify a high risk score.\n- The highest confidence is in benignity, so risk scores should remain low.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only performs an import, and no malicious activity is indicated, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that this is a simple import statement.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1** (since it’s a benign import, but acknowledging that in a broader context, imports could be misused)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component appears safe based solely on this snippet. No further action or concern is warranted here.",
