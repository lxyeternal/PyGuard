  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .core import xtxt, extxt_available_formats`.\n- The code is a standard Python relative import from a local module named 'core'.\n- No evidence of data handling, network activity, or execution of untrusted code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and all reports agree on benignity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet is present and correctly represented in all reports.\n- The import statement is straightforward and syntactically correct.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or potential vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The absence of data flows, sinks, or external interactions indicates no immediate security risk.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The assessments are consistent and align with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1 due to potential future use, but since the snippet itself is benign, this is acceptable.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only slight concern is the report that assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, citing potential if imported functions are used to process untrusted data elsewhere. However, this is speculative based on context outside this snippet, and the snippet itself remains safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is benign.** It performs a simple, standard import.\n- **No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.**\n- **Scores are appropriate** given the evidence.\n\n### My recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, as no actual risk is present in this code snippet)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and free of malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the existing assessments.**",
