{
  "purpose": "Extracts text content from XLSX files by reading visible sheets and formatting cell values into a string output.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input buffer, verifies ZIP archive structure, loads workbook via openpyxl, iterates over sheet rows.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only processes data internally without transmitting or executing external code.",
  "flows": "Buffer read -> ZIP validation -> Workbook load -> Sheet iteration -> Cell value extraction -> Return formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard XLSX file validation and data extraction using common libraries. Error handling is minimal but benign. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose minimal operational risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard XLSX content extractor with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security assessment scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
