{
  "purpose": "The code reads an XLSX (Excel) file from a byte stream, extracts visible worksheet data up to a maximum number of rows, and formats it as a text output.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'file_buffer' stream; uses 'zipfile.is_zipfile' to validate the file; loads data via 'openpyxl.load_workbook'; reads worksheet and cell data.",
  "sinks": "Returns a formatted string of worksheet data; does not directly write or transmit untrusted data outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input stream -> zipfile validation -> openpyxl workbook loading -> iterate worksheets and rows -> generate output string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and common data extraction routines. Error handling is minimal but benign. No data exfiltration or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of an XLSX file, loads it using openpyxl, and extracts data from visible sheets. It checks if the input is a ZIP archive, reads the workbook, iterates over sheets and rows, and converts data into a string format. No external network calls, no file modifications, and no suspicious logic are present. The exception handling is simple and does not hide or mislead. The code’s purpose aligns with legitimate data extraction without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate XLSX data extractor with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It handles data securely and performs standard operations. No security risks are evident beyond normal operational concerns.",
