{
  "purpose": "The code extracts and converts the content of an XLSX file into a text format, listing sheet names and cell values.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file_buffer input stream, specifically from an XLSX ZIP archive.",
  "sinks": "Uses openpyxl to load and process the XLSX content; no evident sink that leaks untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file_buffer, verifies it's a ZIP archive, loads workbook, iterates over visible sheets and rows, converts cell values to text, and joins into a string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and methods; no obfuscated code or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard XLSX reading and parsing routine. It checks for valid ZIP archive format before processing. It reads visible sheets and processes rows up to a maximum limit, converting cell values to strings. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, nor any backdoors or malicious patterns are evident. The inclusion of 'print' statements for error logging is benign in this context. No code injection, insecure data handling, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and safe XLSX file extractor. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data leaks, or sabotage within this code segment.",
