{
  "purpose": "The code extracts text content from XLSX files, converting sheet data into a string format for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input file buffer, specifically from the zip archive structure of XLSX files and the content of individual worksheet cells.",
  "sinks": "Returns a string of the sheet data; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation are present within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Reads file buffer → Validates ZIP archive → Loads workbook → Iterates over visible sheets → Processes rows → Builds string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The code performs standard XLSX processing without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function starts by resetting the buffer and reading its data, then checks if the data is a valid ZIP archive, which is standard for XLSX files. It loads the workbook in read-only mode and iterates through visible sheets, extracting row data up to a maximum specified limit. The code uses standard libraries and methods with no signs of malicious behavior or external network activity. The registration of the extractor is typical for plugin-based systems. No embedded or hidden malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward XLSX file content extractor with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs standard file validation and data extraction functions suitable for its purpose.",
