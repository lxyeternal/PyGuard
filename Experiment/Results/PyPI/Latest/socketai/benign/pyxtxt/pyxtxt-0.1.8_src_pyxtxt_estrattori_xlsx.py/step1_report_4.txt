{
  "purpose": "The code extracts text content from XLSX files, converting spreadsheet data into a plain text format with optional row limits.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'file_buffer', specifically seeking to read and process its content as an XLSX file.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only reads from the input buffer and processes it internally. It does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The data flows from 'file_buffer' input to the buffer copy, then to openpyxl for parsing, and finally to the returned text string. No external data sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of try-except for error handling is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads an input buffer, verifies it as a ZIP archive (XLSX format), then loads it with openpyxl in read-only mode. It iterates through visible worksheets, extracting cell values into a formatted string. No external network access or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of standard libraries and safe practices suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe, standard XLSX to text converter with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
