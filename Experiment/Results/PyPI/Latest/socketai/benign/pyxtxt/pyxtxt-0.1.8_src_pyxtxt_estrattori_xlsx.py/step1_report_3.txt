{
  "purpose": "To extract and convert data from XLSX (Excel) files into a plain text format.",
  "sources": "file_buffer input which contains the XLSX file data.",
  "targets": "No direct targets or untrusted sinks are evident; the code reads data from a file buffer, processes it, and returns a string.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file_buffer -> Checks ZIP validity -> Loads workbook -> Iterates sheets and rows -> Converts data to string format.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard XLSX reading and data extraction. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an XLSX file from a buffer, verifies it as a ZIP archive, loads it with openpyxl in read-only mode, and extracts cell values into a formatted string. It skips non-visible sheets and limits row extraction if max_rows_per_sheet is set. All operations are standard for data extraction; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate XLSX data extraction without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
