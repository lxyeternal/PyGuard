{
  "purpose": "The code provides multiple functions to extract text content from various file formats such as PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT, HTML, XML, XLS, SVG, and plain text. It includes a dispatch function to automatically determine the file type and route the input to the appropriate extraction function.",
  "sources": "Reads data from file buffers or file paths; uses file buffer streams for processing; utilizes mime type detection via the magic library.",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted text as strings; potential for concatenating untrusted data into output; no direct data leaks or external transmissions are observed.",
  "flows": "Input source (file path or buffer) → mime type detection → appropriate extraction function → text output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Use of 'magic' for mime detection is standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. Commented-out RTF extraction code appears unused but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured text extraction from multiple document formats using reputable libraries. It carefully reuses file buffers to prevent side effects, checks MIME types, and handles exceptions gracefully. The extraction functions do not contain any hidden or malicious logic. The use of 'magic' for mime detection is common. No network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code lacks any suspicious external connections, command execution, or data leaks. The overall design is legitimate and typical for a file processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard file content extraction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain any backdoors, hidden network activity, or malicious payloads. Its structure and logic are consistent with legitimate text extraction tasks.",
