  "purpose": "A multi-format text extraction utility that reads various document types from files or buffers, detects MIME types, and extracts text content.",
  "sources": "File paths or in-memory buffers read via open/read, with MIME detection via 'magic'.",
  "sinks": "Returns extracted text strings; no data leaks or external transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input source → MIME detection → format-specific extraction functions → output text.",
  "anomalies": "Setting custom attributes ('mimeType', 'name') on buffer objects; use of 'magic' for MIME detection; debug print statements; commented-out RTF code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard, reputable libraries for parsing various document formats. It performs passive extraction without executing or modifying data maliciously. The setting of custom attributes on buffers is unconventional but benign. No network activity, code injection, or sabotage is present. The use of 'magic' for MIME detection, while standard, can be exploited with crafted files, but this is a general risk inherent to such tools. The code handles untrusted files cautiously, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, passive, multi-format text extraction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The potential risks are typical for handling untrusted files but do not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
