{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for extracting text content from various document formats such as PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT, HTML, XML, SVG, and plain text, handling both file paths and byte streams.",
  "sources": "Data is read from file buffers (BytesIO objects) or file paths. The code reads the entire content of these files for processing.",
  "sinks": "Extracted text is returned as strings; no direct output to network or files occurs within this code segment. No apparent data leaks or untrusted data flows to external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input files (paths or buffers) are read, their MIME types are detected via 'magic' or based on the input, then routed to specific extraction functions, which parse and extract text data.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads entire files into memory, which could be inefficient or risky for very large files, but does not directly suggest malicious intent. The use of 'magic' to detect MIME types dynamically is standard but could be misused if input is maliciously crafted. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. Some functions print debug information, which could expose information if logs are accessible, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to extract text from multiple file formats using well-known libraries, with careful handling of in-memory streams and file type detection. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, connecting to suspicious domains, or executing system commands. The functions rely on standard libraries for document parsing and MIME detection, which are not in themselves suspicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is that large files are read entirely into memory, which might be exploited for resource exhaustion, but this is a general risk rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a multi-format text extractor intended for legitimate document processing tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage features. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries; no malicious intent or malware indicators are evident. The overall security risk is low.",
