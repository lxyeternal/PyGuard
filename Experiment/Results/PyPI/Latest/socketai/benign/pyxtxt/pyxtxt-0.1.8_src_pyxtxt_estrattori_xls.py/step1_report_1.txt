{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and convert the content of an XLS file into a text format for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the provided file_buffer by calling file_buffer.read() after seeking to the start of the buffer.",
  "sinks": "Uses the xlrd library to parse the Excel file contents; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file_buffer.read() into xlrd.open_workbook, then the data is read from each sheet and row, and converted into strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns. The code relies on standard library and third-party xlrd without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an uploaded file buffer, processes it with xlrd to extract sheet and row data, and formats the output as a string. The error handling simply prints a warning without exposing sensitive data. The registration of the extractor indicates integration into a larger system but does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions. Usage appears to be straightforward data extraction from XLS files.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a data extractor for XLS files and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It handles input data securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
