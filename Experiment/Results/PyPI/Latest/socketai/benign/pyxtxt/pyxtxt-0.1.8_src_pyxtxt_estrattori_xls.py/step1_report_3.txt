{
  "purpose": "To extract and convert data from XLS files into a human-readable string format.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from the file buffer provided as input via file_buffer.read().",
  "sinks": "The code reads from the file buffer; it does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input file buffer through xlrd.open_workbook to process sheets and rows, then compiled into a string output.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic data extraction with no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and registers an extractor for XLS files. The main function opens the XLS file from a buffer, iterates over sheets and rows, and constructs a string with the sheet name and cell values, up to a maximum number of rows per sheet. Error handling simply logs errors without revealing sensitive info. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are detected. Use of xlrd is standard for XLS processing and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data extraction utility for XLS files with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended to process input files without side effects.",
