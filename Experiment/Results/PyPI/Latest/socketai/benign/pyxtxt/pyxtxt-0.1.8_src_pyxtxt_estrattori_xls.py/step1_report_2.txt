{
  "purpose": "The code extracts and converts XLS files into a text format, primarily for data extraction and processing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'file_buffer' via 'file_buffer.read()' which is used as input for 'xlrd.open_workbook'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network; it only processes data internally and prints errors to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source: 'file_buffer.read()' -> 'xlrd.open_workbook' -> iteration over sheets and rows -> return of formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Error handling is minimal but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an XLS file buffer, processes up to 'max_rows_per_sheet' rows per sheet, and formats the data into a string. It handles exceptions gracefully by printing errors. Usage of 'xlrd' is standard for reading Excel files, with no external data leaks or malicious actions. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data extraction utility for XLS files, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to read and format input data without external communication or hidden behaviors.",
