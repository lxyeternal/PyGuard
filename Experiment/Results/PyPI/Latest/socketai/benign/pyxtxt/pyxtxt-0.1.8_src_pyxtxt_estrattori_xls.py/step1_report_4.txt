{
  "purpose": "The code reads and processes XLS files to extract and format sheet and row data into a string representation.",
  "sources": "Reads file data from the 'file_buffer' input and the 'xlrd.open_workbook' function with 'file_contents'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write untrusted data elsewhere or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'file_buffer.read()' into 'xlrd.open_workbook', then into the iteration over sheets and rows to produce a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard file parsing. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to open and read XLS files from a buffer, and extracts sheet names and row data into a string. Exception handling is basic, printing errors without exposing sensitive data. The 'register_extractor' call registers the function for specific MIME types. No network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic is present. Usage of 'xlrd' for reading XLS files is standard. No indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign XLS file extractor with no malicious or security risk indicators.",
