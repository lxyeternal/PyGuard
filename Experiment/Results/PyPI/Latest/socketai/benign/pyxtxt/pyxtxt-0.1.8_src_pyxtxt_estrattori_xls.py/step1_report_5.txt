{
  "purpose": "The code extracts data from XLS files and formats it into a readable string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the entire content of the uploaded file via file_buffer.read().",
  "sinks": "The data is processed and returned as a string; no external data sinks are present. No network, file, or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data from file_buffer.read() flows into xlrd.open_workbook() for parsing, then the data is processed into a string and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The only notable aspect is reading entire file contents for processing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses xlrd to open and parse an uploaded Excel file, converting its sheets into a formatted string. It handles multiple sheets and limits rows per sheet to avoid large memory usage. Exception handling prevents crashes and outputs errors to stdout. There are no network operations, code injection, or malicious payloads. No suspicious obfuscation or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate data extraction from XLS files with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a benign utility function for parsing Excel files.",
