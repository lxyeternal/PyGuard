  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads and registers extractor functions from Python modules in the current directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() to list directory files, importlib.import_module() to load modules dynamically",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of arbitrary modules based on directory contents",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> Dynamic import of modules -> Registration of extractors",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import based on directory contents without validation; no explicit input validation or filtering, which could be exploited if malicious modules are present",
  "analysis": "The script scans the current directory for Python files (excluding __init__.py) and dynamically imports them, registering extractor functions. This approach can be risky if malicious or tampered modules are added to the directory, as it may lead to execution of untrusted code. The code itself does not contain malicious logic but relies on external files for functionality, which could be a vector for supply chain attacks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present. However, the dynamic import mechanism without validation could be exploited in a compromised environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dynamic module loading from the directory, which is a common pattern but potentially dangerous if untrusted modules are present. There are no explicit malicious behaviors or backdoors, but the lack of validation for imported modules could lead to execution of malicious code if the environment is compromised.",
