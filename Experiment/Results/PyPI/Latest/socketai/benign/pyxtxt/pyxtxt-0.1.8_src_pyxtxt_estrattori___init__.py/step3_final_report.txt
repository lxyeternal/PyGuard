  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and registers extractor functions based on available Python modules in the current directory.",
  "sources": "Reads directory listing via os.listdir(), identifies Python files, constructs module names from filenames.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module() executes code in identified modules, potentially executing malicious code if modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> filename filtering -> module name construction -> importlib.import_module() execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard dynamic import pattern. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory listing and imports all Python modules except __init__.py, registering functions in a dictionary. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the lack of validation or sandboxing during dynamic imports, which could allow malicious modules to execute arbitrary code if added to the directory. The code's logic is straightforward and clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The risk stems from environment trust assumptions rather than the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader pattern with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for supply chain or environment-based compromise if malicious modules are introduced. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.5) is appropriate due to the unvalidated dynamic import pattern.",
