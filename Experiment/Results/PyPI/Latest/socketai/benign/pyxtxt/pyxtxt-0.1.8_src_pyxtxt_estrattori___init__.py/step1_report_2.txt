  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads Python modules from the current directory and registers extractors for different MIME types.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() to list directory files; importlib.import_module() to import modules dynamically.",
  "sinks": "None directly, as there are no untrusted data outputs or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Listing files -> Filtering Python modules -> Importing modules -> Registering extractors (via register_extractor function).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed. The dynamic import approach could be misused if malicious modules are added to the directory, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script registers extractor functions for specific MIME types into a dictionary. It automatically loads all Python modules in the same directory, excluding __init__.py. This pattern is common for plugin systems but could pose risks if malicious modules are added to the directory. However, the code itself does not perform malicious actions or data exfiltration. No use of environment variables, network connections, or unsafe code practices are present. The code appears to be a plugin loader for a modular system, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader pattern that imports modules from the current directory. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its content. The only potential concern is the dynamic import of modules which could be exploited if malicious modules are added externally, but this is a general risk of such patterns rather than specific malicious intent.",
