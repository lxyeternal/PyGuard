  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads Python modules from the current directory to register extractor functions for different MIME types.",
  "sources": "The code reads files in the current directory to identify Python modules for import.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules dynamically based on directory contents could execute arbitrary code if malicious modules are present.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> Dynamic module import -> Registration of extractor functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions; however, dynamic import based on directory contents can be risky if untrusted modules are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a registry for extractor functions, then automatically imports all Python modules in its directory except '__init__.py'. This process could execute any malicious code if an attacker adds a malicious module to the directory. There are no explicit security checks or restrictions on module content. The code does not sanitize or verify module contents, leading to potential execution of malicious code during import. No other suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The functionality appears straightforward for plugin registration, but the dynamic import pattern is inherently risky if directory contents are not controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs dynamic module loading to register extractors, which is a common plugin pattern. However, this pattern can be exploited if malicious modules are added to the directory, potentially leading to code execution. No explicit malicious intent or malicious code detected within this snippet, but the approach carries inherent risks if module sources are untrusted.",
