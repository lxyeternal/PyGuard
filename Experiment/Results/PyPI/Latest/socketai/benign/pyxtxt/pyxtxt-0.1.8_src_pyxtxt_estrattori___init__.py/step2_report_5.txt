  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code dynamically imports all Python modules in its directory to register extractors, with no malicious logic detected. It notes the risk of importing untrusted modules but considers the code itself benign.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.3\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n  - The risk score (0.3) reflects awareness of potential risks from untrusted modules, which is reasonable.\n  - Malware score is appropriately zero, as no malicious activity is detected.\n  - Obfuscation is zero, matching the lack of obfuscated code.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the plugin pattern and noting potential risks from dynamic imports but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The lower risk score (0.2) is justified, given the code's benign nature but acknowledgment of inherent risks.\n  - Malware remains zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscation remains zero.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Highlights the potential danger of executing arbitrary code via dynamic imports if malicious modules are present, noting no malicious code within the snippet itself.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.6\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The risk score (0.6) is higher, reflecting the inherent danger of unvalidated dynamic imports.\n  - Malware remains zero, as no malicious code is detected.\n  - Obfuscation is zero.\n\n**Justification for risk**:\n- The code's pattern can be exploited if malicious modules are added, leading to code execution.\n- Since the report explicitly states no malicious code is present, the risk score should reflect potential danger rather than confirmed malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- The risk score of 0.6 seems appropriate, given the potential for exploitation.\n- Malware score remains zero, which is correct.\n- Obfuscation remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the potential danger of importing untrusted modules without validation.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The risk score (0.4) seems appropriate, balancing the common plugin pattern with the potential for exploitation.\n  - Malware remains zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscation remains zero.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Reiterates the dynamic import pattern, noting the lack of safeguards and potential security risks but no malicious code.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The risk score aligns with the pattern's inherent dangers.\n  - Malware remains zero.\n  - Obfuscation remains zero.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores** across all reports are zero, which is justified given no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores** are zero, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores** vary from 0.2 to 0.6, generally reflecting the potential dangers of dynamic module loading without validation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' reasoning.\n- The higher risk scores (around 0.6) are justified due to the potential for supply chain attacks if malicious modules are added.\n- No evidence of actual malware or obfuscation is present, so the malware and obfuscated scores remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk**: 0.4 — a balanced view acknowledging the potential danger of untrusted dynamic imports.\n\n**Conclusion**: The current scores are appropriate and reflect the code's security posture accurately.",
