{
  "purpose": "Register and load extractor functions dynamically from Python modules in the current directory.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() to list directory contents, importlib.import_module() to import modules dynamically.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code lists Python files in the directory and imports them dynamically, potentially executing arbitrary code from those modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of dynamic imports could be risky if malicious modules are present, but this depends on the environment and module trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to register extractors by defining a function and then automatically importing all Python modules in its directory. This process involves listing directory contents and importing modules based on filenames. While this dynamic importing can be risky if malicious modules are present, the code itself does not contain malicious logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or backdoors. The process is common for plugin systems but can be exploited if untrusted modules are added. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent but does depend on external module trust.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader that dynamically imports modules from its directory. It does not contain malicious behavior but could pose security risks if untrusted modules are added to the directory. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
