  "purpose": "The code dynamically registers extractor functions for different MIME types by loading modules from the current directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the current directory contents using os.listdir and __file__ to identify Python modules to import.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules via importlib.import_module based on directory listing.",
  "flows": "os.listdir -> importlib.import_module",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically imports all Python modules in the current directory except __init__.py without any validation or filtering, which could lead to unintended modules being executed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes dictionaries for extractors and their display names. It defines a function to register extractors. It then lists all files in the current directory, filtering for Python files (excluding __init__.py). For each such file, it constructs a module name based on the current module name and the filename, then imports it dynamically. This approach allows for flexible extension but can be risky if malicious modules are present in the directory, as they will be imported and executed without verification. There are no apparent security checks or sandboxing measures. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is visible in this fragment. The code itself appears standard for plugin registration with dynamic module loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to load modules dynamically from the current directory, which is common in plugin architectures. However, it lacks safeguards against malicious modules or unintended code execution. The implementation itself is not malicious, but the automatic import mechanism could be exploited if malicious modules are present. Overall, it poses a potential security risk due to lack of validation but does not contain malicious intent by itself.",
