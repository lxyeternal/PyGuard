  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code dynamically imports all Python modules in its directory to register extractors, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** The code does not contain malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The dynamic import is a common plugin pattern, but it can be risky if untrusted modules are added.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 seem reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found. The risk score is low, reflecting the potential danger if untrusted modules are added.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the plugin pattern and potential risks of dynamic imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation. The main concern is the inherent risk of importing untrusted modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the potential security concern without implying malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the risk of executing arbitrary code via dynamic imports if malicious modules are present.\n- **Findings:** The code does not contain malicious code but the pattern is risky.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.6. The risk score is higher here, reflecting the potential danger.\n- **Justification:** The risk score is justified because if an attacker adds a malicious module, it could execute arbitrary code during import.\n- **Assessment:** The malware score remains 0, which is correct since no malicious code is present in the snippet. The risk score is appropriately higher due to the potential for exploitation.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the lack of validation during dynamic import.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, but the pattern can be exploited.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. This seems reasonable given the potential for exploitation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the plugin pattern and potential risks.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or obfuscation, but the lack of validation is a concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.6, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic imports without validation.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The higher risk scores (0.4-0.6) are justified given the potential for supply chain abuse if malicious modules are added.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n**Risk:** approximately 0.4 — considering the inherent danger of dynamic imports without validation, which could be exploited in a compromised environment.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The main concern is the potential exploitation via untrusted modules, not malicious code within the current code snippet itself.",
