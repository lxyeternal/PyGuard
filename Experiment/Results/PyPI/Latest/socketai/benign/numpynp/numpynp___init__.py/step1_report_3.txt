  "purpose": "Load specific text files from the package directory and expose their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading local files using open() in the _load_text_file function.",
  "sinks": "Reading files does not lead to any data leakage or untrusted data processing; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The function reads files from the package directory and assigns their contents to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the package directory, defines a helper function to load text files, and loads several text files into variables. The code only reads local text files with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, suspicious variables, or external inputs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, safe, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply loads local text files into variables.",
