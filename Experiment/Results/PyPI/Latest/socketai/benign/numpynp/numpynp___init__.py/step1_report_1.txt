  "purpose": "Load several text files from the package directory and expose their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads files named 'Emotion.txt', 'Housing.txt', 'Plant.txt', 'BUBBLEMERGE.txt', 'PARALLELREDUCTION.txt', 'VECTORMATRIX.txt', 'BFSDFS.txt' from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, database, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load content from known text files into variables; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to load text files from the package directory and assigns their content to variables. It uses standard library functions without dynamic code execution or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The overall structure is simple and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for loading static text files and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
