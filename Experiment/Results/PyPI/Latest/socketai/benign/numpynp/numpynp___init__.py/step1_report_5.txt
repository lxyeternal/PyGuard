{
  "purpose": "The code loads multiple text files from the package directory and exposes their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using open() with specified filenames.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the loaded data is stored in variables but not used in a way that leaks or exposes data externally.",
  "flows": "File reading operations load content into variables; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The filenames suggest static data, no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its package directory via __file__, then defines a helper to load text files from this directory. It loads several files ('Emotion.txt', 'Housing.txt', etc.) into variables. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. All operations are straightforward file reads with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing static file loading with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application that uses these text files as data sources.",
