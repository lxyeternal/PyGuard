  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing static file reads from known filenames within the package directory.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears to be a utility for loading static resources, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The \"malware\" scores across all reports are zero, indicating no malicious activity detected or suspected.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are also zero, consistent with benign, static resource loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- The code does indeed load specific text files from the package directory into variables, as described.\n- The logic is simple: determine directory, define helper, load files into variables.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or suspicious data flows are present.\n\n### Potential Issues or Flaws:\n- The reports do not identify any issues with the code's logic or implementation.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The code relies on known filenames, which could be a concern if the files are malicious, but this is not indicated here.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores seem consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple resource loader with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security risk. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future files or code modifications introduce dynamic behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
