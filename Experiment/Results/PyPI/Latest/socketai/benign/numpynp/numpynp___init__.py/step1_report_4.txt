  "purpose": "Load specific text files from the package directory and assign their contents to variables.",
  "sources": "File reading operations via open() on local files within the package directory.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading static files during module load; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file reading without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the package directory and loads several text files into variables. It uses a helper function that reads files from the local filesystem with UTF-8 encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or code injection. All operations appear to be static file loads during module import, with no user input or dynamic data involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple static file loading with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, serving as a resource loader within a package.",
