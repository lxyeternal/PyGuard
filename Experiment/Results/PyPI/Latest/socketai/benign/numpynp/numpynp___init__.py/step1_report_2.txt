{
  "purpose": "The code loads several text files from the package directory and exposes their contents as variables.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the package directory using open() and os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "The file reading operations and variable assignments, which do not directly lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "The code reads text files and assigns their contents to variables; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external data sources or network communication",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to load text files from its package directory, then reads several specific text files into variables. All operations are local file reads with explicit filenames. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward, and the operations are safe, assuming the files are benign and intended.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and functions solely to load text data from local files into variables. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
