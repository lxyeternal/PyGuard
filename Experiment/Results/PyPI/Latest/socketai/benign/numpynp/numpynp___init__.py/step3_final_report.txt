  "purpose": "Load specific static text files from the package directory into variables for internal use.",
  "sources": "Reading files via open() with os.path.join(_package_dir, filename)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration or external communication",
  "flows": "File path resolution -> file reading -> variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file loading with no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code determines its directory, defines a helper to load text files, and loads multiple known filenames into variables. It uses standard library functions safely, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The filenames suggest static resources. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, benign, and performs static resource loading without external inputs or outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static resource loader with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and straightforward.",
