{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, used for version management.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no data leaks or vulnerable sinks present.",
  "flows": "Version string and tuple assignments are straightforward; no flow of untrusted data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a type checking block and assigns version info without any suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version information for a package, including conditional type annotations and straightforward variable assignments. There are no dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The presence of version variables and their static assignment indicates normal package metadata management. The 'TYPE_CHECKING' block is standard for static type hints and does not affect runtime behavior maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version information module with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious code. It appears to be auto-generated by a versioning tool, containing no sensitive data or malicious logic.",
