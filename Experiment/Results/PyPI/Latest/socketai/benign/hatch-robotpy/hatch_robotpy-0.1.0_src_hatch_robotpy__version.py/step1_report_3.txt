  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input; static assignment of version strings and tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and purely for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version information module, typically auto-generated, with no input/output operations or external interactions. It uses conditional type hints but only assigns static version data. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated versioning stub with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only assigns static version data for package identification.",
