  "purpose": "Define and export version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; purely static assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information variables for the package, with conditional type annotations. The code is straightforward, static, and does not process external inputs or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or supply chain risks are present. It simply defines version strings and tuples for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining version metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
