  "purpose": "Manage and assign version information for the package, generated automatically by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static version strings and tuples assigned directly; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely static assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static version management snippet with no dynamic code, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs. It uses typical type hinting practices and assigns fixed version info. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is solely to manage version info, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for version management, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
