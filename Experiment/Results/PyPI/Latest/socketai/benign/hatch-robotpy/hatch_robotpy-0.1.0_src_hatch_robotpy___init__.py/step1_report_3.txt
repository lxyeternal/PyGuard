  "purpose": "Import the package version and assert its presence to ensure the module is correctly loaded.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version import __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports a version string and asserts its existence.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and assertion; no anomalies detected. The assert statement could be used to catch missing version info but is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local module and asserts its existence. The assertion is a minimal check to prevent the module from loading if __version__ is missing. No user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performs a basic import and validation, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
