{
  "purpose": "Import the version string of the package to make it accessible and assert its presence to satisfy linters.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '_version' that provides '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing __version__ to asserting its existence; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for version declaration; no unusual code or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, then asserts its presence. This is a common practice for version management. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic is present. The assert statement is simple and used for linter satisfaction, not runtime security purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling version information with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
