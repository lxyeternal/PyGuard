  "purpose": "Import and verify the package version to ensure it's available.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version module to access __version__.",
  "sinks": "The assertion checks the value of __version__, but does not affect data flow or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import __version__, then assert its truthiness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string or variable from a local module and asserts its existence to satisfy linters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The assertion merely ensures that __version__ is defined and truthy, which is a common practice in package initialization. The code is simple, readable, and lacks any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard version check with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and typical in Python package modules.",
