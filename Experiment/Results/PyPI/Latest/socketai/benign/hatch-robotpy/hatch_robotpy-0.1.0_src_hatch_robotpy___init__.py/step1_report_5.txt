  "purpose": "Import the package version to ensure the module's version is available and to satisfy linter checks.",
  "sources": "The imported __version__ from the local _version module.",
  "sinks": "The assert statement which could potentially halt execution if __version__ is falsy.",
  "flows": "The imported __version__ flows into the assert statement to verify its truthiness.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert statement for a version check; potential risk if Python is run with optimizations (-O) which disables assert statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __version__ from a relative module and uses an assert to ensure __version__ is truthy. The assert is a common pattern for simple validation but can be problematic if Python is executed with optimization flags, as assert statements are skipped. No external inputs, untrusted data, or malicious code are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple version check with a standard pattern. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of assert is a minor concern but not malicious.",
