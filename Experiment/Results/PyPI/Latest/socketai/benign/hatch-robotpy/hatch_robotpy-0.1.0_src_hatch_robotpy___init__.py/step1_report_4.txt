{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module and asserts its existence to satisfy linters.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module '_version'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple import and assertion without data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an assertion to verify version existence is common; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version variable and asserts its presence. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious behavior. The assertion is a standard practice to ensure the version is defined, with no security implications. No obfuscated code, no suspicious constructs, and no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and benign. It performs a simple import and a check to ensure the version variable is set, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
