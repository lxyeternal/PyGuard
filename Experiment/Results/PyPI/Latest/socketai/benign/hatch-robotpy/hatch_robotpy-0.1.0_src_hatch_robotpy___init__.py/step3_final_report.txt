  "sinks": "Assertion statement that checks __version__'s truthiness",
  "flows": "Import from _version module -> __version__ variable -> assertion check",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert for version validation, which can be disabled with Python -O flag",
  "analysis": "The code performs a minimal import of __version__ and asserts its presence. No external data, user input, or network activity. The assert is used for validation but can be skipped if Python runs with -O, which is a known best practice concern but not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the potential disablement of the assert statement. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version declaration, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern about the use of assert is acknowledged but does not constitute a real threat. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
