  "purpose": "Registering a build hook in the hatchling plugin system by returning the DownloadHook class.",
  "sources": "Import of 'hookimpl' from 'hatchling.plugin' and the local 'DownloadHook' class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code simply returns a class reference.",
  "flows": "The function 'hatch_register_build_hook' is called during plugin registration, returning 'DownloadHook' without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard plugin registration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin registration decorator and a class, then defines a function decorated with '@hookimpl' that returns the class. It involves no external data, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for plugin systems. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin registration snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign nature of the code.",
