  "purpose": "Registering a build hook for the Hatchling plugin system",
  "sources": "Import statements from hatchling.plugin and local plugin module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; returning a class reference as part of plugin registration",
  "flows": "Import statements -> hook registration function -> returning DownloadHook",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and adheres to standard plugin registration pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports a hook implementation decorator and a local plugin class. It defines a function 'hatch_register_build_hook' decorated with @hookimpl that returns the DownloadHook class, likely used in a plugin system. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is present. The code follows standard plugin registration practices. The presence of local plugin class 'DownloadHook' does not imply malicious intent; it's part of expected plugin architecture.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin registration snippet for Hatchling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply registers a build hook via a well-known plugin pattern.",
