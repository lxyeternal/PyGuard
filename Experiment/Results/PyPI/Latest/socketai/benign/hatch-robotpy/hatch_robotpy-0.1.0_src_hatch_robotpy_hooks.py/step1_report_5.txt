  "purpose": "Registering a build hook in a plugin system, likely for a packaging or build tool.",
  "sources": "The import of hatchling.plugin and the function hatch_register_build_hook which returns DownloadHook.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code only defines and registers a hook.",
  "flows": "Imports modules → defines function → returns DownloadHook class",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward plugin registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin interface and a class, then defines a function that registers a build hook by returning a class. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to serve a plugin registration purpose, which is typical in build systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin registration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
