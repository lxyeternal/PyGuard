  "purpose": "Defines data structures for managing download configurations with platform-specific path substitutions, primarily for artifact retrieval and file extraction.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for ${ARCH} and ${OS} placeholders, class attributes for URLs, paths, and lists of libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data leaks within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Placeholder regex substitutions in path strings; no data flow involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard placeholder substitution patterns and data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data classes with regex patterns for platform-specific placeholder substitution. There is no active code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The regex substitutions are simple and standard for templating. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The only potential concern is downstream misuse if external configurations are maliciously crafted, but this is outside the scope of this code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration data structures with placeholder substitution for platform-specific paths. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
