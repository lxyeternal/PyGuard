  "purpose": "Defines data structures for downloading and managing libraries, headers, and files from Maven repositories and zip files, with platform-specific path modifications.",
  "sources": "Code itself; no external inputs read directly within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data processing; the code primarily defines data classes and regex replacements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; platform-specific path replacements are local string substitutions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of regex to replace placeholders (${ARCH}, ${OS}) is standard. Commented-out code related to patches could hint at patch management, but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of dataclasses for downloading resources with platform-specific adjustments. No user input, network operations, or system modifications are directly present here. Regex replacements are simple placeholder substitutions. No suspicious logic, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure supports secure resource management, with optional patches and environment conditions, but nothing indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and data structure setup for managing downloads and platform adjustments. It does not contain malicious behavior or security threats based on the provided content.",
