{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for configuring and managing downloads of Maven libraries and ZIP files, primarily for build automation and artifact management.",
  "sources": "None; all data fields are class attributes initialized from parameters or defaults.",
  "sinks": "None; no execution or untrusted data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing paths are present; this code only defines classes and regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of regex patterns for '${ARCH}' and '${OS}', which are placeholders that will be substituted later; no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for managing download configurations, with fields for URLs, paths, and optional patches. The only dynamic aspect is the '_update_with_platform' method, which replaces placeholders in URL and directory strings with platform-specific values. No external input handling, network operations, or code execution are present. The regex patterns used for substitution are simple and intended for template string replacement, not obfuscation or malicious encoding. The code appears to be a typical configuration/data structure setup for build systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for managing artifact downloads with placeholder substitution; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
