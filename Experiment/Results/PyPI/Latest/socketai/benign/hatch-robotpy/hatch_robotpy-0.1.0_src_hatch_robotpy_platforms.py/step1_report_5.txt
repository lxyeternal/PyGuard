{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and functions for retrieving platform-specific information related to WPILib Maven artifacts, primarily for cross-platform compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_platform(), import distro, and re.fullmatch() for pattern matching platform strings",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly reads platform info and matches patterns",
  "flows": "Input from sysconfig.get_platform() and distro.id() flows into conditional logic to determine platform data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of regex matching for platform identification is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides platform-specific metadata, leveraging sysconfig and distro modules to determine current platform. It uses pattern matching for macOS and Linux platforms, and raises an error if an unsupported platform is requested. The functions are straightforward, with no apparent data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are present. The modules used are standard for platform detection. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign platform detection utility for cross-platform build or compatibility purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
