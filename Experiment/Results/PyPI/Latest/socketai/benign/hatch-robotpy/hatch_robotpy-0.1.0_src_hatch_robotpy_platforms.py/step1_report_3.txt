  "purpose": "Define and retrieve platform-specific configurations for WPILib Maven artifacts based on the system environment.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_platform(), import distro, re module for pattern matching",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no external data or untrusted inputs used in critical operations",
  "flows": "sysconfig.get_platform() -> platform selection logic -> _platforms dictionary lookup",
  "anomalies": "Use of import distro within get_platform function, which is conditional and not used maliciously but could be leveraged to execute code or query system details; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for platform info, populates a dictionary of platform configurations, and provides functions to retrieve platform info based on system environment. The get_platform function utilizes sysconfig and optionally distro module to determine the current platform, adjusting platform selection accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The import of distro is conditional and limited to environment inspection, which is common in platform-specific scripts. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for platform detection and configuration management without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. The use of distro is typical for environment detection and does not raise security concerns. Overall, the code appears safe.",
