  "purpose": "Platform detection for WPILib Maven artifacts based on system environment.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_platform(), optional import of distro for Linux distribution detection.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; purely local environment detection.",
  "flows": "Reads system info via sysconfig and possibly distro, then maps to predefined platform configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'distro' for Linux detection; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured platform detection utility. It uses standard modules and conditional logic to identify the current environment. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The optional 'distro' import is used safely and only for environment detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.0 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign platform detection utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
