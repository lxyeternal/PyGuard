  "purpose": "Defines platform-specific configurations and utility functions for retrieving platform info related to WPILib Maven artifacts.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_platform(), import distro, hardcoded platform data in _platforms dictionary",
  "sinks": "None identified as directly untrusted data sinks or potentially exploitable data leaks",
  "flows": "sysconfig.get_platform() -> get_platform() -> _platforms lookup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of platform detection and data structures; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclasses for platform info, a dictionary mapping platform names to platform configurations, and functions for retrieving platform info based on system parameters or cross-platform identifiers. The get_platform() function uses sysconfig to determine the current platform, checks for specific macOS patterns, and conditionally imports the 'distro' library to refine Linux platform detection. There is no use of untrusted input for critical operations, no network operations, and no execution of code based on external data. The use of exception handling around optional 'distro' imports is standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to be for environment detection without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward platform detection utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It relies on standard libraries and does not perform any unsafe operations. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
