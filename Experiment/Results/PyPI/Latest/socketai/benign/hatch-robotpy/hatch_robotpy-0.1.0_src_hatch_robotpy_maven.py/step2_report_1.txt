  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code performs configuration data transformation, generating URLs with placeholders like `${OS}` and `${ARCH}`.\n- No actual code injection, dynamic execution, or network activity is present.\n- Placeholders are typical in build scripts and do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: mostly 0 or 0.2) seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs URLs for Maven artifacts, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nA high securityRisk score (0.9) seems excessive given the benign analysis. The code is safe; the placeholders are standard, and no malicious behavior is evident. The high score should be lowered.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, generating download configurations with placeholders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. The low securityRisk reflects the benign nature, and malware/obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Converts configuration into download objects; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar configuration processing; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. Slightly higher securityRisk score might reflect minimal concern over placeholder usage, but overall acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a benign configuration utility for generating download URLs for Maven artifacts.\n- The placeholders are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The security risk score can be kept low, reflecting the absence of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1 - 0.2** |\n\n**Note:** The small security risk score accounts for the use of placeholders that could, in theory, be misused if not properly substituted, but this is a common pattern in build scripts and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing scores are reasonable, with minor adjustments to reflect the benign nature.",
