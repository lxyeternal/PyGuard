  "purpose": "Generate URLs for Maven artifacts and convert configuration data into download objects with placeholders for runtime substitution.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the MavenLibDownload object such as repo_url, group_id, artifact_id, version, use_sources, sources_classifier, libs, staticlibs, use_headers, extract_to, strip.",
  "sinks": "URL construction functions, especially _get_artifact_url, and creation of Download objects with the constructed URLs and configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Input attributes from MavenLibDownload -> URL formation with placeholders -> creation of Download objects with these URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders like '${OS}', '${ARCH}', and '${OS}${ARCH}' in URLs; no actual code injection, dynamic execution, or network activity; straightforward data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs download URLs based on configuration data, using standard placeholder patterns for build-time substitution. It performs validation on sources and headers, and creates Download objects accordingly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The placeholders are typical in build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The logic is simple, with no network activity or data leaks. Overall, the code is a safe configuration utility for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of placeholders is standard in build scripts. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal inherent risk due to placeholder usage. No further adjustments are necessary.",
