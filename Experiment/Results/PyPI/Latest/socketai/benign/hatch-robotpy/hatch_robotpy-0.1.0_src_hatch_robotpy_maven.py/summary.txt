  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of placeholders is standard in build scripts. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting minimal inherent risk due to placeholder usage. No further adjustments are necessary."
