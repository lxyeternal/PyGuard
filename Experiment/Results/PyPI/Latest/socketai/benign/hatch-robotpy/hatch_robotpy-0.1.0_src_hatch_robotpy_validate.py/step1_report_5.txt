{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for handling validation errors and parsing input data according to a specified type.",
  "sources": "Input data is read in the parse_input function via the 'value' parameter; error information may be derived from the errors.ValidationError exception raised by validobj.validation.parse_input.",
  "sinks": "The code raises ValidationError instances, which could be logged or propagated but do not directly cause security issues. No sinks appear to perform network operations, file access, or other sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into parse_input, which calls validobj.validation.parse_input; if an errors.ValidationError occurs, it is caught and transformed into a ValidationError with contextual info. No external untrusted data flows beyond input parameters; error handling is internal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code uses standard exception handling and string processing. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles validation errors from an external validation library, converting these errors into custom exceptions with detailed messages. It reads input data via function parameters and processes validation exceptions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no network calls, file operations, or system manipulations. The error transformation function constructs error messages, but does not perform any risky operations. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility module for validation error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard validation error handling utility with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
