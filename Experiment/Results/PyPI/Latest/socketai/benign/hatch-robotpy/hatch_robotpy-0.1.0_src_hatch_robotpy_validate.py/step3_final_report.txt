  "purpose": "A validation utility that wraps an external validation library to parse input data and convert validation errors into a detailed, formatted exception.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to parse_input; error objects from validobj.validation.parse_input",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages incorporating 'fname' and 'prefix' parameters, used in exception raising",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation function -> validation error -> _convert_validation_error -> formatted message -> exception raised",
  "anomalies": "Use of external parameters 'fname' and 'prefix' in error message formatting, which could be manipulated if untrusted",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation and error handling, wrapping validation errors into a custom exception with contextual info. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The use of 'fname' and 'prefix' in message formatting could pose a minor injection risk if these parameters are externally controlled, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 to 0.2) are justified given the minimal potential for message injection if parameters are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and standard for validation error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk related to message formatting is acknowledged but not significant. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
