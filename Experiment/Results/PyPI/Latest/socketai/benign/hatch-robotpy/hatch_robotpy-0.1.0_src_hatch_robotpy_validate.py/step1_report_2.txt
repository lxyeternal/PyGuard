{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling validation errors and parsing input data using the 'validobj' library, facilitating data validation and error messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'value' parameter passed to 'parse_input' function and potentially from 've', an exception object from 'errors.ValidationError'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a custom 'ValidationError' with formatted messages, which could lead to error message injection if 'fname' or 'prefix' are externally controlled, but this is unlikely in typical use. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is validated via 'validobj.validation.parse_input'. Validation errors are caught and processed to produce a formatted 'ValidationError'. No external data flows or untrusted outputs beyond error message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on error handling and data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception and a function to convert validation errors from the 'validobj' library into user-friendly error messages. 'parse_input' wraps the validation call and transforms validation exceptions into formatted errors. No external data flows or suspicious activities. The logic is standard for validation error processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data validation and error formatting without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware indicators, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the formatting of error messages if 'fname' or 'prefix' are externally influenced, but this is a standard practice and unlikely to be malicious.",
