{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling validation errors and parsing input data according to a specified type, using the 'validobj' validation library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'parse_input' function, specifically from the 'value' parameter, and accesses exception attributes within the 'errors' module.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the raising of 'ValidationError' exceptions which include detailed error messages constructed from validation errors.",
  "flows": "Input data ('value') is passed to 'validobj.validation.parse_input' as a source; validation errors are caught, processed, and re-raised with contextual messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard exception handling and external library calls. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation and error handling modules, then defines custom error conversion and input parsing functions. It handles validation exceptions by transforming them into more user-friendly messages. The use of 'validobj' for validation indicates reliance on a third-party library for input validation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. All data flows are contained within standard validation routines, with no external data transmission or harmful side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward validation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes input data and manages validation errors, relying on established libraries. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious behavior.",
