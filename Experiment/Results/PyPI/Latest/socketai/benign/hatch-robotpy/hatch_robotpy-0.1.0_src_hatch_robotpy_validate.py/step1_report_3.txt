{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for handling validation errors and parsing input data using the 'validobj' library, mainly for type validation and error conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'value' parameter in 'parse_input' function; it imports modules from 'validobj' and 'validobj.errors'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions ('ValidationError') based on validation failures; error messages are generated and propagated. No untrusted data directly affects system commands or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to 'parse_input', which calls 'validobj.validation.parse_input'. Validation errors are caught, converted, and re-raised as exceptions with detailed messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic is present. The code relies on external 'validobj' library functions, but does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom error handling and wraps validation logic with error translation. It uses standard exception handling to manage validation errors. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code; the code's structure is straightforward, focusing on error handling and data parsing. The import statements and function calls appear normal and do not show signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation error handling and parsing utility, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the external 'validobj' library for core validation logic. Overall, it appears safe, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
