{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a validation utility, converting validation errors into a standardized format and parsing input data according to a specified schema.",
  "sources": "Input data received by the function parse_input, specifically the 'value' parameter; errors raised within validobj.validation.parse_input.",
  "sinks": "Raising of ValidationError with detailed message; no network, file, or environment variable interactions present.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is passed to validobj.validation.parse_input; validation errors are caught and transformed into ValidationError with detailed location and message information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily deals with error handling and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom ValidationError and a function to convert validation errors from the 'validobj' library into this custom exception, adding context such as location and message details. The parse_input function calls the validation library's parse_input, catches validation errors, and re-raises them with added context. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code appears. The code performs straightforward validation error handling and data parsing logic without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages validation errors and data parsing without any harmful actions or hidden functionalities.",
