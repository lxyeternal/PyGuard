  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder or documentation stub for an MCP time service, providing only a descriptive comment and version identifier.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code contains only a comment and a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple comment and version declaration with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a documentation comment and a version string with no functional or malicious code. It does not read input, write output, or interact with external systems. There are no signs of obfuscation, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's minimal and benign nature. Given the absence of executable logic or suspicious patterns, the code poses no security threat and is unlikely to be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or security-sensitive content. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal, documentation-like structure. No further action or revision is necessary.",
