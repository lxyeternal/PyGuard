  "purpose": "Basic MCP (Master Control Program) time service implementation.",
  "sources": "No data sources such as input streams, environment variables, or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identifiable as the code is only a description and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a docstring and a version string; no actual executable logic or code is included.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal, consisting of a docstring comment describing a basic time server, and a version string variable. There are no functions, data input or output, or executable logic present. Without any actual implementation, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation detectable. The code appears to be a simple placeholder or documentation snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional placeholder or description with no executable content, no data handling, and no malicious activity. It does not pose any security threats or malware risk.",
