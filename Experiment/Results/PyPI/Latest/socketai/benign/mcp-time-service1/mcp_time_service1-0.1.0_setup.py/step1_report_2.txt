  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'mcp-time-service1'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools modules, and defining package metadata and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the script only performs standard package setup operations. No untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No dangerous data flow; input (README.md) is only read from a local file, and data is used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code adheres to standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries, reads a local README file with exception handling, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident. It performs typical package setup tasks without any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or handling of untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard Python package configuration with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
