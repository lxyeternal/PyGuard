  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing the MCP time service module.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file; passes metadata to setuptools; defines CLI entry point.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder URL and email; no actual malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with safe file reading, dependency declaration, and CLI entry point. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The placeholder URL and email are common in template files and do not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score. The code performs standard packaging tasks without any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
