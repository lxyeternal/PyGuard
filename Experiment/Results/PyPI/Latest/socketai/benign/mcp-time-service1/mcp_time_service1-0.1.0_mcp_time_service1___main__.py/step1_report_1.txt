{
  "purpose": "This code implements a time service server using the 'mcp' framework, providing tools to retrieve current time and date information, and a resource to access timezone info.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output data from external modules and functions, primarily through server requests via the 'mcp' framework. No explicit external data sources are directly read by the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements for logging errors and debug info, and the 'mcp.run()' method that starts the server, which may handle untrusted requests or data.",
  "flows": "Input requests trigger calls to 'get_current_time', 'format_date', and access to 'timezone_info', which process data (e.g., datetime and format strings) and return results. Data flows from request inputs to function outputs and to client responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward time-related functions. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The logging of calls is standard debugging info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and checks for the 'mcp' dependency, exiting if absent. It defines two tools and a resource, all related to time data, with no external data sources or untrusted inputs beyond typical server request handling. The 'get_current_time' and 'format_date' functions use datetime safely. The resource provides timezone info securely. The server startup and error handling are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. The code appears to be a legitimate time service implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward time service server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data or perform unsafe operations. No anomalies or malware patterns detected.",
