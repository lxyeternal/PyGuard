{
  "purpose": "Set up an MCP server providing time-related utilities and resources.",
  "sources": "Imports external 'mcp' package, reads environment for datetime functions, and calls mcp.run() to start the server.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions handle untrusted input; the main sink is the mcp.run() call which starts the server.",
  "flows": "The server's tools and resource functions are invoked via the mcp framework, primarily returning system time and timezone info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The print statements for debugging are benign. No data exfiltration or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'mcp', provides tools to get current time and formatted date, and a resource for timezone info. It initializes an MCP server instance and registers functions for external access. The main function starts the server with mcp.run(). There are no input handling or network communications outside the MCP framework. No suspicious logic, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward MCP server providing time utilities. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. It functions as an authorized time service, with safe use of datetime and standard server initialization.",
