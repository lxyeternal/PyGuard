{
  "purpose": "Provides a time service with tools to get current time, format date, and timezone info via an MCP server.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context'; functions decorated with @mcp.tool() and @mcp.resource(); server startup in main().",
  "sinks": "mcp.run() call initiating the server; print statements for logging.",
  "flows": "No user-supplied or untrusted input is processed; functions generate output based on system datetime. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for logging; no apparent hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries and external MCP package. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an MCP server with tools providing current time, formatted date, and timezone info, all based on system datetime. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are handled. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be straightforward, serving a simple time service without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign time service implementation using MCP framework. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
