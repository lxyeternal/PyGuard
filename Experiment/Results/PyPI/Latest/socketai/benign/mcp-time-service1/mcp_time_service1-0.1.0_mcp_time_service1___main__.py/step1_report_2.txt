{
  "purpose": "Provides a time service with tools and resources related to current time and date, accessible via an MCP server.",
  "sources": "Imports from external 'mcp' package, standard libraries, and functions that generate or handle datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for logging, mcp.run() which starts the server, and functions returning time and timezone data.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves importing dependencies, defining tools/resources, and running the server; no untrusted input flows into sensitive functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The logging appears normal. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, checks for the 'mcp' package, and exits if missing. It creates an MCP server instance with tools for current time, date formatting, and timezone info. These functions use datetime and print logs to stderr, which is typical for debugging or tracing. The server is started with mcp.run(), with error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or data theft. The functions do not accept untrusted input that could be exploited, nor do they leak data externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MCP server implementation providing time-related services. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It uses standard libraries and well-structured code with appropriate error handling.",
