{
  "purpose": "Provides a basic MCP time service with tools for current time, date formatting, and timezone info.",
  "sources": "Standard library calls to datetime for current time and timezone; no external untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging via print statements; server startup via mcp.run(). No external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Code flow from server start to request handling functions; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured MCP server providing time utilities. It uses standard libraries, handles errors gracefully, and exposes no sensitive data or external inputs. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The server's exposure is typical for such services, with minimal security risk. The logs are for debugging purposes and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign MCP time service with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to server exposure, but the implementation itself is safe.",
