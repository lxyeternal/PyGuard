{
  "purpose": "Provide a time and date service via an MCP server with tools and resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements, datetime functions, mcp.server.fastmcp module, and environment for server operation.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that handle untrusted input or cause data leaks; no network or external data transmission beyond MCP server framework.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flow; the code mainly provides functions that return system time and timezone info without external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or unauthorized data access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes an MCP server, defines tools for retrieving current time and formatting date, and provides timezone info as resource. No user input is processed directly; functions return data based on system time and timezone. The server is started with mcp.run(), and error handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign MCP server implementation providing time-related utilities. There are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided code.",
