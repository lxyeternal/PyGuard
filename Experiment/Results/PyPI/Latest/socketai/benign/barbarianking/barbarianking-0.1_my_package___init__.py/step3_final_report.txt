  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, command-line arguments, imported modules, file/network outputs, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "File system, network connections, environment variables, command execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs lead to data processing or output functions, with no suspicious or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious API calls, obfuscation, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal and benign, primarily performing standard data processing or utility functions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The confidence scores are high (0.75-0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code. Malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are conservative, mostly at 0.2 or below, indicating minimal threat. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
