{
  "purpose": "The code includes multiple scripts for data analysis, visualization, tree structure manipulation, graph visualization, and clustering.",
  "sources": "Reads data from external files (EXPERIMENT 6), user input through dialogs (EXPERIMENT 7), and in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "Uses plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, networkx) for visual output; loads data from files; accepts user input via GUI dialogs.",
  "flows": "File input flows into data parsing and tree building; user input flows into graph manipulation and node addition; visualization functions display generated plots.",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval() on file data which can execute arbitrary code; loading data via eval() from files is insecure. No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. No obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data analysis and visualization tasks, including text preprocessing, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, graph visualization, and clustering. The only potentially risky behavior is the use of eval() to parse file content in load_tree_from_file, which could execute malicious code if the file content is malicious. Otherwise, no malicious intent or malicious code patterns are observed. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on user input for node and edge additions but does not transmit data over the network or access external services. The overall structure and function are consistent with benign visualization and data analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for data visualization, analysis, and GUI-based tree and graph manipulation. The main security concern is the insecure use of eval() when loading tree data from files, which could be exploited if malicious files are loaded. Otherwise, no malicious or sabotage behavior is detected.",
