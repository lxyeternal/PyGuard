{
  "purpose": "The code contains multiple scripts for data analysis, visualization, and interactive graphical interfaces, including text processing, tree structures, graph visualization, and clustering analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external files (Experiment 5), user input through GUI dialogs (Experiments 6 and 7), and file dialogs (Experiment 6). It also uses standard libraries for data and text processing.",
  "sinks": "User inputs are processed via GUI dialogs and file reads. Graph visualization is performed with matplotlib. Data is processed and displayed locally; no evidence suggests data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from files or user input, processed through text analysis, tree structure manipulations, or graph updates, then visualized locally. No external network data transfer or untrusted data flow to malicious sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code segments are present. The code performs standard data analysis and visualization tasks with appropriate libraries.",
  "analysis": "The scripts involve typical data processing, visualization, and user interaction workflows. Experiment 5 performs text preprocessing and topic modeling without any network or security-sensitive operations. Experiments 6 and 7 implement GUI-based tree and graph manipulation, also without network activity. Experiment 8 executes clustering analysis locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data theft, or unauthorized system access. The code relies on standard, well-known libraries and methods, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be benign, designed for data analysis, visualization, and interactive graph/tree management. No malicious or sabotage-related behavior is evident. It is safe for use and does not pose supply chain security risks.",
