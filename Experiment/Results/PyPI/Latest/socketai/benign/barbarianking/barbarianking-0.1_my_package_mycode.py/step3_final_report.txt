  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code snippets for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and code flow, focusing on supply chain security implications.",
  "sources": "File reading in 'load_tree_from_file' function, input dialogs in Experiment 7, data loading and processing functions, and external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'eval' on file content, data visualization functions, and GUI event handlers that could process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "File content read via 'open' -> evaluated with 'eval' in 'load_tree_from_file' -> potential execution of malicious code; user input dialogs in Experiment 7 lead to graph modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' on external file data, which can execute arbitrary code; no other suspicious or obfuscated code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data analysis, visualization, and GUI operations with standard libraries. The critical security concern is the use of 'eval' in 'load_tree_from_file', which can execute malicious code if the input file is crafted maliciously. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The 'eval' usage introduces a significant risk, justified by the potential for remote code execution. The rest of the code is straightforward and benign. The security risk score should be elevated to reflect this vulnerability, while malware and obfuscation scores remain at zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign but contains a high-severity security vulnerability due to the unsafe 'eval' usage. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main risk stems from executing untrusted file content. The risk score should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.7 to accurately reflect this threat.",
