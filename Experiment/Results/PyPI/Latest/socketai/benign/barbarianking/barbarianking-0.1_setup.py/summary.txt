  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a typical, benign configuration file. The risk of malicious activity is negligible based on this code alone. The potential for malicious behavior exists only if 'my_package.mycode:main' contains malicious code, which is outside the scope of this review. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) is justified."
