      "conclusion": "The setup.py is a typical, benign configuration file. The risk of malicious activity is negligible based on this code alone. The potential for malicious behavior exists only if 'my_package.mycode:main' contains malicious code, which is outside the scope of this review. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) is justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is generally benign but contains a high-severity security vulnerability due to the unsafe 'eval' usage. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main risk stems from executing untrusted file content. The risk score should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.7 to accurately reflect this threat."
