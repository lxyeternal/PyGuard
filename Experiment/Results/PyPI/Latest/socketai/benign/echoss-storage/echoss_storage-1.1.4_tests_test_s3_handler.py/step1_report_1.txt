  "purpose": "The code retrieves a list of JSON objects from an S3 bucket and prints their contents.",
  "sources": "Reading environment configuration from 'env_config.yaml'; fetching bucket list and object list from S3; retrieving object data from S3.",
  "sinks": "Printing JSON data to standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment config load -> S3 bucket/object list retrieval -> S3 object download -> JSON parsing -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures; no obfuscation; no dynamic code execution; no suspicious domain connections.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment and S3 configuration details from a YAML file, then uses a custom S3ResourceHandler class to list buckets and JSON objects within a specified bucket. It retrieves each JSON object and prints its content. No sensitive data, credentials, or secrets are hardcoded. The code performs standard S3 operations and printing, which are typical for data processing scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The reliance on external files ('env_config.yaml') and custom classes ('FileUtil' and 'S3ResourceHandler') makes it impossible to verify their trustworthiness, but their usage appears consistent with typical SDK-like patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard cloud storage data retrieval and output. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign data-processing utility with no security risks evident in the provided code.",
