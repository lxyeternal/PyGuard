  "purpose": "The code appears to load environment configurations, initialize an S3 resource handler, retrieve a list of buckets and JSON objects, and print the JSON data from each object.",
  "sources": "Reading environment configuration from 'env_config.yaml', accessing AWS S3 bucket list and object list, retrieving objects from S3.",
  "sinks": "Printing JSON data retrieved from S3 objects.",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> S3 resource handler -> bucket/object listing -> object retrieval -> JSON parsing -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials detected; code does not perform any suspicious network communication; no encryption or obfuscation; no use of dynamic execution or eval. It appears to follow standard S3 data retrieval procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment-specific configuration from a YAML file, initializes an S3 handler, and retrieves a list of JSON objects from an S3 bucket. It then fetches each object, converts it to JSON, and prints it. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious data handling is visible. No suspicious file operations, code injection, or data exfiltration behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and patterns for S3 interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical data retrieval and logging utility that accesses S3 storage. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It appears to be a benign, utility-oriented script for working with cloud storage data.",
