  "purpose": "Retrieve environment-specific configuration, list S3 buckets and objects, fetch JSON files, and print their contents.",
  "sources": "Reading 'env_config.yaml' for environment settings; calling methods on 'test_s3' to list buckets and objects; fetching object data via 'get_object_file'.",
  "sinks": "Printing JSON data to standard output.",
  "flows": "Configuration load -> S3 bucket listing -> Object list retrieval -> Object fetch -> JSON parsing -> print.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cloud storage interactions: loading environment configs, listing S3 buckets and objects, retrieving JSON files, and printing their contents. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. External dependencies are used but appear standard. The code's logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The printed JSON data could pose privacy concerns but not security risks. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for retrieving and printing JSON data from S3. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. External dependencies should be verified in a full security review, but based on this code, it is safe.",
