{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves a list of JSON objects from an S3 bucket, loads their contents, and prints the JSON data.",
  "sources": "Reading environment configuration from 'env_config.yaml', retrieving object list from S3 bucket, and reading objects from S3.",
  "sinks": "Printing JSON data retrieved from S3 objects.",
  "flows": "Environment config loaded -> S3 bucket object list retrieved -> each object downloaded -> JSON data parsed -> printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no unusual or obfuscated code; no suspicious patterns detected. Use of environment config is standard; no dynamic code execution or external network calls other than S3 access.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data from a YAML file, accesses an S3 bucket using a handler, and retrieves JSON objects, which it then prints. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The S3 interaction appears standard, and the data handling is straightforward. No signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like connecting to unknown domains, executing external code, or handling sensitive data improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical S3 data retrieval and print script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
