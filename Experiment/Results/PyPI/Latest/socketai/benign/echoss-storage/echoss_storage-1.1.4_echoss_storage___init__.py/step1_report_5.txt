  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static",
  "anomalies": "Absence of secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports a specific class from a local module. No user input, external data, or network activity is present. The import appears standard for a package structure. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard module initialization with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
