  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: setting a version string and importing a class from a local module.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The import statements are standard and do not appear to load external or malicious code dynamically.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for module initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, straightforward import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard package init code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; minimal code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly different confidence level (0.9), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The mention that import might load external code is a generic statement; without dynamic import or code execution, this is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final considerations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is benign and minimal.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  **Appropriate.** All malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The scores are reasonable given the code.\n\n- **Any suspicious claims?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard module initialization snippet with no security issues. No changes are necessary.",
