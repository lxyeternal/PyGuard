  "purpose": "Module initialization with version info and import of local handler class",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ and static import from local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; static import from local module",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static import does not involve external data",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and a static import statement from a local module. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. No secrets, credentials, or network activity are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features indicate it is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
