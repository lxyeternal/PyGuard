  "purpose": "Initialize module with version and import S3ResourceHandler",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's version string and imports a class from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling, no data leaks, no security-sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and import",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no anomalies; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a class from a local module. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. It appears to be a standard module initialization snippet without any malicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
