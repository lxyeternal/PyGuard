  "purpose": "Initialize module version and import S3ResourceHandler for handling S3 resources",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__, import statement for .s3_handler.S3ResourceHandler",
  "sinks": "Import statement could be a sink if it loads malicious code dynamically, but in this case it appears to be a straightforward import",
  "flows": "Code sets a version string and imports a class from a local module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports a class from a relative module. There are no input data sources, no untrusted data flows, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The import is standard for Python modules. The code is very minimal and appears to be standard boilerplate for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic module initialization code with no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It appears safe and standard.",
