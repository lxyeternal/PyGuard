  "purpose": "Define package version and import S3ResourceHandler from a local module",
  "sources": "The code assigns a version string to __version__ and imports S3ResourceHandler from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only sets a version and performs an import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a class or function from a local module, likely part of a package initialization. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not process external input or perform network operations. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initialization snippet that defines a version and imports a handler. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security risks.",
