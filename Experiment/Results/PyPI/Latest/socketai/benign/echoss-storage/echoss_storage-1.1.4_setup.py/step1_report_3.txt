  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'echoss-storage' Python project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; defining package metadata and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external command execution",
  "flows": "Reading file -> Assigning to variable -> Passing variables to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; dependencies appear standard for the described functionality",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It reads the README.md to set long_description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and other configurations. All dependencies are common libraries (boto3, opencv-python, numpy, tqdm, pillow) without suspicious versions or sources. There are no code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated elements present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The dependencies are common and benign, and there are no suspicious code patterns.",
