  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'echoss-storage', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; hardcoded strings for package metadata; dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input handling or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools to define package details and dependencies. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies with version constraints. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The package metadata appears typical, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
