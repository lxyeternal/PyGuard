{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'echoss_storage' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and retrieves package dependencies via install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or direct execution of untrusted code detected.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into long_description; dependencies are specified explicitly in install_requires.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No external network connections or system modifications within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. The dependencies listed are typical for such a package, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code does not execute any untrusted input, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code constructs. All data handling appears straightforward and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It follows standard practices for Python packaging without including suspicious or harmful code.",
