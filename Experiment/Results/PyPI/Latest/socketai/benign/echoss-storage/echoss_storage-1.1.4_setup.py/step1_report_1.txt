  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'echoss-storage' with its dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; reading package metadata; listing dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no execution of untrusted input; no network connections or file writes based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; dependencies are standard package specifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The URL field is empty, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. All dependencies are specified with version constraints and are common Python packages. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The empty URL field is unusual but not harmful. The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data leakage. It strictly adheres to typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears safe based on this code fragment.",
