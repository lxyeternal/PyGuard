{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'echoss-storage', defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; defining install_requires dependencies; static package and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script primarily configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading a README file for long description, specifying dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The dependencies listed are common packages; no suspicious packages or commands are invoked. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and benign. It functions as a typical Python package configuration file without any malicious intent or security issues.",
