{
  "purpose": "Implements a proximity-based classifier combining RandomForest and NCM, utilizing shared memory and multiprocessing for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via load_existing_shm, applies model functions, and accesses shared memory segments for proximity calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications detected; data remains within process memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input via shared memory, through proximity computations, and into classification functions without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shared memory and multiprocessing is complex but standard; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML proximity calculations with parallel processing, using internal utilities for shared memory management. No suspicious external interactions or malicious code are present. The shared memory usage, while intricate, is typical for performance optimization in ML workflows. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for high-performance ML implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized ML proximity classifier with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
