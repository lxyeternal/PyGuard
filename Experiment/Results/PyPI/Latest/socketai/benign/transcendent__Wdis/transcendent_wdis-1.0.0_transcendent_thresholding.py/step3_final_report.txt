{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for threshold derivation, application, and performance evaluation during conformal evaluation, primarily for model performance tuning and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function arguments such as test scores, predicted labels, groundtruth labels, and environment variables for seeding randomness.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are via logging and print statements; no external network, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve threshold application, metric calculations, and reporting within memory, with no external data leaks or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. Use of environment variables (`os.urandom`) for seeding randomness is standard. Import of unused `transcendent.data` is benign but extraneous.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML evaluation tasks: threshold application, performance metrics calculation, and hyperparameter search routines. It employs multiprocessing and randomness for hyperparameter tuning, all within benign, well-understood practices. No external communication, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for threshold optimization and performance evaluation in machine learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
