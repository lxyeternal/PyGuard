  "purpose": "Helper functions for setting up the environment, including shared memory management, logging configuration, and argument parsing.",
  "sources": "argparse argument parser, shared_memory from multiprocessing, environment variables (via sys), standard libraries, and third-party modules (numpy, termcolor).",
  "sinks": "Potential logging output, shared memory operations, argument values, and imported modules.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and logged; shared memory functions allocate, load, and clean up memory; logging formatter displays colored logs; argument parsing functions process inputs for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors; use of shared memory functions and argument parsing are standard for multiprocessing and configurability. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for environment setup, including shared memory management, logging configuration with colored output, and argument parsing for a machine learning or data processing pipeline. It uses standard Python modules and widely accepted third-party libraries without any signs of malicious behavior. The shared memory functions are designed for multiprocessing scenarios and are implemented securely. The logging formatter enhances readability but does not perform any malicious actions. Argument parsing is extensive but straightforward, with no indication of data exfiltration or malicious input handling. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for environment setup and argument parsing with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It securely manages shared memory, configures logging, and handles command-line inputs appropriately. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
