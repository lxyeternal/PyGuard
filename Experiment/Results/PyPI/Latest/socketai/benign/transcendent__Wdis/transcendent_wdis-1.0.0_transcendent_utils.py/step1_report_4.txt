  "purpose": "Helper functions for setting up the environment, including shared memory management, logging configuration, and command-line argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line inputs into internal configurations, shared memory allocation functions, and logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. Use of standard libraries and safe multiprocessing techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for shared memory allocation, logger setup, and argument parsing. Shared memory functions handle creation, loading, closing, and unlinking of memory blocks, which are standard multiprocessing procedures. The logger setup uses colored output for different log levels, which is typical for readability. The argument parser defines numerous options related to datasets, thresholds, and calibration, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden behaviors. No external network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a benign setup utility with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for environment setup, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages shared memory, logging, and command-line arguments in a straightforward and secure manner.",
