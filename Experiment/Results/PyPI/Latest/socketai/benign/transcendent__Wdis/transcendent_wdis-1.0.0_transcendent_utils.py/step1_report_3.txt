  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment setup, including shared memory management, logging configuration, and command-line argument parsing.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from command-line arguments via argparse, environment variables indirectly through logging setup, and shared memory segments for multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from command line influence shared memory allocation and logging behavior; no data flows to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The shared memory functions appear standard for multiprocessing. Logging formatter customizes output but does not involve malicious behavior. Argument parsing covers typical configuration options; no malicious parameters evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements helper functions for multiprocessing shared memory, logging with colored output, and argument parsing for configuration. Shared memory management functions create, load, and free shared memory segments securely using Python's multiprocessing.shared_memory. The logger formatter adds colored, styled output to stdout, which is harmless. Argument parsing defines typical parameters for dataset handling and calibration thresholds. No suspicious or malicious code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no network or file operations indicating malicious intent. All functions serve legitimate purposes in environment setup and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for environment setup and configuration, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles shared memory, logging, and argument parsing in a conventional manner suitable for a larger application. No malicious intent detected.",
