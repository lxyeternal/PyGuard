  "purpose": "Functions for producing conformal evaluation scores such as non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence p-values for binary classifiers (SVM and Random Forest).",
  "sources": "Input data from classifier methods (`decision_function`, `predict_proba`), shared memory via `load_existing_shm`, and external utils for shared memory management.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in shared memory, no external network or file system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from classifier outputs to shared memory, then through multiprocessing for parallel computation of p-values and scores.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in `np.concat` (should be `np.concatenate`), but no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard conformal evaluation techniques with appropriate use of shared memory and multiprocessing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, with no hardcoded secrets or external system modifications. The only minor issue is a typo that would cause runtime errors, but it does not relate to security. The code's purpose is statistical evaluation, not system manipulation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of conformal evaluation metrics for binary classifiers. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.2) is justified by the use of shared memory and multiprocessing, which are standard practices in high-performance ML workflows.",
