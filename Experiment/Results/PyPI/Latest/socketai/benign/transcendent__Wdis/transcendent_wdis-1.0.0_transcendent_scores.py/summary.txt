  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of conformal evaluation metrics for binary classifiers. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The low risk score (~0.2) is justified by the use of shared memory and multiprocessing, which are standard practices in high-performance ML workflows."
