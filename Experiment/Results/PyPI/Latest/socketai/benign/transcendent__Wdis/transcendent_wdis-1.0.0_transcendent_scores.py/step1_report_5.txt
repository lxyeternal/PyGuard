  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating non-conformity scores, credibility, and confidence p-values for a conformal evaluation framework, specifically tailored for binary classification tasks using SVM and Random Forest classifiers.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input feature arrays (X_in, X_test), labels (y_in, y_test), and classifier methods such as decision_function and predict_proba. Shared memory is allocated and loaded via utils functions, which read existing shared memory segments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could flow into shared memory segments and be accessed via load_existing_shm, but these functions are part of the utils module and do not appear malicious on their own. The code uses standard classifier methods which do not contain untrusted input handling or unsafe execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input feature matrices and labels through classifier methods (decision_function, predict_proba) to compute non-conformity scores, which are then used to calculate p-values. Shared memory segments are used to pass data between processes. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read or executed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex multiprocessing with shared memory for potentially large datasets, but this is a legitimate technique for performance and not suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code. The utils functions for shared memory management are external and not included here, so their behavior cannot be directly evaluated, but their use appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on conformal prediction and scoring methods, utilizing classifier decision functions and probabilities. It employs multiprocessing for efficiency and shared memory for inter-process communication. No code injections, dynamic code execution, or malicious data handling routines are present. All data processing steps involve standard statistical and machine learning operations with no signs of data exfiltration or backdoors. The utils functions are external and their security cannot be confirmed, but their usage is consistent with legitimate shared memory handling. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of conformal prediction scoring with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate implementation for scoring and evaluation in conformal prediction contexts. It does not contain malicious or sabotage behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. It mainly interacts with classifier outputs, shared memory, and statistical calculations, all of which are typical for this application. No signs of malware or malicious intent were detected.",
