  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence scores used in conformal evaluation for binary classification tasks, specifically with SVM and Random Forest classifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data from functions like get_rf_ncms, get_svm_ncms, compute_confidence_scores, and compute_single_cred_p_value, which read classifier outputs, feature matrices, and label arrays; data is loaded from shared memory segments using load_existing_shm.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data can be exposed through shared memory, logging, or dataframes, but there are no explicit data leaks or external network connections; no functions write data externally or to network sockets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from classifier decision functions and predict_proba methods (sources) through various computations in non-conformity measures, credibility, and confidence functions, to result objects like dataframes and returned scores; shared memory segments facilitate inter-process communication but do not leak data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present; code uses shared memory and multiprocessing appropriately; no obfuscated or malicious code behaviors are detected; the code appears standard for conformal prediction computations.",
  "analysis": "The script contains functions for computing non-conformity measures for SVM and Random Forest classifiers, as well as functions for calculating credibility and confidence scores using shared memory and multiprocessing. Data is loaded from shared memory segments, and multiprocessing is used to parallelize computations. All data handling appears to be within the context of model evaluation; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious file operations are observed. The use of shared memory and multiprocessing is consistent with performance optimization, not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code is evident. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate model evaluation workflows, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard conformal prediction score calculations for classifiers, utilizing shared memory and multiprocessing for efficiency. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
