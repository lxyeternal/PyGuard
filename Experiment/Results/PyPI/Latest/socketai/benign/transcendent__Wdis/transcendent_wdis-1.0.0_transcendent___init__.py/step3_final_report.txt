  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, file reads, network connections, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into data processing or network sinks; no suspicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no use of eval/exec, no suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, performing standard data handling with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minor exposure points like environment variables but no active threats. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
