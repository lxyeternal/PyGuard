  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network transmissions, or data writes, but no explicit sinks are identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from data sources to sinks cannot be established without actual code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observable due to lack of code data.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to absence of code. No source, sink, or flow patterns can be identified without code content. Standard checks for malicious behaviors, such as suspicious imports or code structure, cannot be applied.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; thus, no malicious behavior or security risks can be determined. The review is inconclusive.",
