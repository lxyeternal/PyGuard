{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class for a Nearest Centroid Machine (NCM) classifier, with commented-out methods for calibration and p-value computation.",
  "sources": "Imports from abc module; class and method definitions; commented-out code segments",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data transmission, system calls, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code is a class interface with no execution flow or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and commented-out sections are inactive",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class with an abstract method 'ncm'. The commented-out methods suggest intended functionality for p-value calculation and calibration, but are inactive. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows that could indicate malicious activity. The structure is typical for a machine learning class interface, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class definition for a machine learning classifier with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The commented code indicates planned functionality but does not introduce any security concerns.",
