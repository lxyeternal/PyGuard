  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a classifier with methods related to Non-Conformity Measures (NCM) calculations, including calibration procedures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; all code is method definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; code is solely method signatures and comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code contains only commented-out functions and an abstract method.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code includes standard statistical functions; no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with a single abstract method 'ncm' and several commented-out methods related to p-value calculation and calibration, which are typical in statistical or machine learning contexts. There are no active data processing, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The commented-out code appears to be standard procedures for calibration and p-value computation, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. The absence of active code beyond class definition indicates minimal runtime behavior. No indications of malicious or sabotage activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class for a classifier with commented-out calibration methods. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a machine learning framework.",
