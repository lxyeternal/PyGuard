  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for a Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier with commented-out calibration methods.",
  "sources": "Class definition and commented methods; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data causes harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No active code execution or data flow; only an abstract method declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code, but no unusual or suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with a single abstract method 'ncm'. All other methods are commented out. There are no active data inputs, outputs, or external calls. The commented code appears to be standard statistical methods for p-value calculations, calibration, and predictions, but they are inactive. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign abstract class definition with no active or malicious behavior. The commented-out sections are typical for classifier calibration and do not indicate malicious intent.",
