{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for a classifier utilizing the Non-Conformity Measure (NCM), with commented-out methods for calibration and p-value calculations, serving as a template or interface for subclasses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only defines an abstract class and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the code contains only class and method signatures with no active logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive commented-out functions related to calibration and p-value computation, but no active anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with a single abstract method 'ncm'. All other functions are commented out, indicating placeholders or incomplete implementation. No active code performs data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The commented functions are standard statistical procedures and do not exhibit malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of active logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns suggests benign intent. The commented-out code could be part of a larger framework but currently poses no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, template-like abstract class with no active malicious or suspicious behavior. The commented-out functions are standard statistical methods, and no security risks are present. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
