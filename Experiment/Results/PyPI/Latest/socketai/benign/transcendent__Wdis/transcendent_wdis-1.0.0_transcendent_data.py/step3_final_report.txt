  "purpose": "Functions for loading features, caching models, and saving results in a machine learning pipeline, primarily handling file I/O and serialization.",
  "sources": "File reads from pickle files (load_csr_list, load_cached_data), filename generation for saving results.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted pickle files loaded via pickle.load, which could execute arbitrary code if maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Loading data from pickle files (load_csr_list, load_cached_data) -> use in ML pipeline; saving models/results via pickle.dump.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for loading data without validation; no active malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling operations with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the use of pickle, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle files are malicious. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present. The risk scores across reports appropriately reflect pickle's inherent security risks, but no active malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for ML workflows, with the main vulnerability being the use of pickle without validation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The current scores are justified; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.",
