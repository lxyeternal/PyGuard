  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open-source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, data output, network communication, code files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, data leaks, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, data processing routines, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, empty or placeholder files, unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code or absence of code, with scores and confidence levels aligned with the descriptions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present. Empty or placeholder files are noted but deemed non-malicious within context. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent across reports. Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat, with slight variation for empty files where a marginal increase (0.1) is justifiable. Confidence levels correspond to the amount of information available, with higher confidence for detailed code and lower for missing or empty files.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports and descriptions, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores and zero malware indicators are justified. The overall assessment indicates a benign security posture, with no immediate threats detected.",
