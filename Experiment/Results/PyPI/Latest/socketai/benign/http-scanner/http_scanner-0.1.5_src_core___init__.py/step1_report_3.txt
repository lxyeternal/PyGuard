  "purpose": "This source code appears to implement a data processing utility, possibly for logging or analytics, involving user input and data output.",
  "sources": "User input via functions or external data sources, environment variables, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Data output functions such as network transmission, file writing, or logging mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input or environment) through processing functions to sinks (output or external communication).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard input handling and data output routines. No use of dynamic code execution, suspicious network calls, or data exfiltration methods observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual variable names detected. The code structure is typical and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious injection.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The code appears safe, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
