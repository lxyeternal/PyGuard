  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalous patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, file I/O, dynamic imports, network calls, eval/exec statements, hardcoded URLs/credentials",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, subprocess executions, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), potentially via eval/exec or dynamic imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials or URLs, placeholder or empty scripts",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as eval/exec, dynamic imports, network activity, and obfuscation, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Absence of code or placeholder scripts results in low or zero risk scores. Suspicious behaviors are appropriately flagged with higher malware and risk scores, especially in reports describing obfuscation and dynamic execution. The reasoning aligns with standard security assessment practices, and scores are consistent with observed patterns. No false positives are evident; the assessments are cautious and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code or risk, with Report 2 showing behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, justified by higher scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent and appropriate, with minor room for slight score adjustments if concrete evidence of dynamic execution is confirmed.",
