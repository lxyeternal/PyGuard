  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the installation or configuration of a Python package, possibly with some network or system interactions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, imported modules, and any user input (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network sockets, files, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes dynamic execution, obfuscated identifiers, or hidden network communications. Hardcoded credentials or URLs are suspicious. Use of eval or exec could be malicious if present.",
  "analysis": "The code was analyzed for typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure includes imports, possible environment reads, and system calls. No explicit malicious commands or indicators of data exfiltration were found. However, any dynamic execution or obfuscated code segments require closer scrutiny. The overall pattern does not show clear signs of malicious intent, but certain dynamic elements or external calls could pose risks if misused.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. It appears to be standard setup or configuration code with no suspicious network activity or backdoors identified. However, if obfuscated or dynamically executed parts are present, they warrant further review. Overall, the code seems safe with low suspicion, but some caution is advised if dynamic features are used.",
