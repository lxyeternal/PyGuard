      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with appropriate low malware and risk scores. Report 2's obfuscation and suspicion justify a moderate concern, but without concrete malicious payloads, scores remain low. Slightly increasing the obfuscation score for report 4 reflects its opacity. Overall, the security posture appears low risk, with scores consistent with the evidence. No evidence of active malware or high security threats is present."

      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code or risk, with Report 2 showing behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, justified by higher scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent and appropriate, with minor room for slight score adjustments if concrete evidence of dynamic execution is confirmed."
