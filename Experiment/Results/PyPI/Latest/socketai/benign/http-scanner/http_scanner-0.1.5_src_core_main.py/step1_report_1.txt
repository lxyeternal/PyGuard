  "purpose": "To parse command-line arguments and run a pipeline based on configuration and plugin names.",
  "sources": "Input: command-line arguments (`--input`, `--processor`, `--output`, `--config`), config file specified by `--config`.",
  "sinks": "The `run_pipeline` function, which receives plugin names and configuration data, potentially executing arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → load_config() reads the config file → run_pipeline() uses plugin names and config data to execute tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns present. The code performs straightforward argument parsing and configuration loading.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a YAML configuration file and passes plugin identifiers along with this configuration to the `run_pipeline` function. No obfuscated code, hidden execution, or malicious data handling is evident. The potential security concern depends on the implementation of `run_pipeline`, which is external and not provided. The script itself does not contain malicious behavior, nor does it manipulate data insecurely or perform suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, legitimate command-line interface for running a pipeline with specified plugins and configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable within this snippet. The security risk largely depends on the safety of the `run_pipeline` function and the contents of the config file, which are outside the scope of this review.",
