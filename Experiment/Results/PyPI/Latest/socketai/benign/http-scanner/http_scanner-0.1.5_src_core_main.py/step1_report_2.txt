{
  "purpose": "This script orchestrates an HTTP scanning pipeline by loading configuration data and executing a pipeline with specified plugins.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a configuration file specified by --config and command-line arguments for plugin names.",
  "sinks": "The run_pipeline function is called with user-supplied plugin names and configuration data, potentially affecting execution flow.",
  "flows": "The code loads configuration from a file, then passes plugin names and configuration to run_pipeline, which may process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears straightforward without hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; reliance on external run_pipeline function is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to parse user input for plugin names and configuration file path. It loads the YAML configuration securely with yaml.safe_load and then calls run_pipeline with these parameters. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious command execution, and no obfuscated code. The code's security depends on the implementation of run_pipeline, but within this snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple orchestrator for an HTTP scanning pipeline, securely loading configuration data and passing user-specified plugin names to an external function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
