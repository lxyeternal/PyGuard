{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper that parses arguments, loads a YAML configuration, and executes an external pipeline function.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--input, --processor, --output, --config), configuration file loaded via yaml.safe_load",
  "sinks": "Data passed to run_pipeline, including plugin names and configuration data",
  "flows": "Arguments and config data flow from user input to run_pipeline invocation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; external function reliance is noted but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that securely loads configuration and delegates execution to an external function. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The security assessment hinges on the trustworthiness of run_pipeline and the plugins it loads, but the code itself is benign. The YAML is loaded securely with yaml.safe_load, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and external dependency considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score appropriately reflects reliance on external components, but no direct vulnerabilities are present within this snippet.",
