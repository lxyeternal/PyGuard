  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'http-scanner' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the script does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the setup script to the package installer; no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports provided are empty, offering no additional information. Given the absence of evidence, the package appears benign. The dependencies are standard, and the entry point suggests a CLI tool. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard and appears secure. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting a safe and benign package.",
