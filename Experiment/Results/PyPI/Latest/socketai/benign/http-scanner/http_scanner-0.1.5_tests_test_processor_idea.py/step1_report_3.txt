  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet; potential sources could include environment variables, files, or network inputs if present elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are identifiable in the visible code; potential sinks would be network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks is visible; more code context is needed to determine any source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain apparent malicious patterns such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. No unsafe code constructs or malicious intent indicators are present in the provided snippet. Lack of context limits deeper analysis, but based on current review, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code looks standard and safe within the context provided.",
