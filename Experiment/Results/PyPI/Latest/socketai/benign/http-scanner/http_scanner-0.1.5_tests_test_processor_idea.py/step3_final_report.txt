  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, external inputs, or code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks without suspicious transformations or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; code is minimal or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. Scores are consistently low (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high when code is available, lower when data is missing. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and no suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with scores appropriately reflecting the lack of malicious indicators. No modifications are necessary.",
