  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with appropriate low malware and risk scores. Report 2's obfuscation and suspicion justify a moderate concern, but without concrete malicious payloads, scores remain low. Slightly increasing the obfuscation score for report 4 reflects its opacity. Overall, the security posture appears low risk, with scores consistent with the evidence. No evidence of active malware or high security threats is present."
