  "purpose": "Manage the downloading and deletion of a model file, including integrity checks.",
  "sources": "config.ZENODO_URL, config.ZENODO_MD5, config.MODEL_PATH, config.DATA_DIR, input from click prompts.",
  "sinks": "File operations (write, remove), network requests, user prompts for confirmation.",
  "flows": "Network request to download model from ZENODO_URL -> Save to MODEL_PATH -> Calculate MD5 -> Compare with ZENODO_MD5 -> Potential removal or re-download based on comparison -> Delete data directory upon user confirmation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network domains aside from a standard URL. Use of user prompts and MD5 checks are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily downloads a model file from a specified URL, checks its integrity with an MD5 hash, and manages deletion of data. The download is straightforward and uses requests with a timeout. The MD5 verification acts as a safeguard against tampering. User prompts are used for confirmation before re-downloading or deleting data. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected. All actions are standard for model management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical model management utility with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs file download, integrity verification, and directory removal with user confirmations, all within expected behaviors.",
