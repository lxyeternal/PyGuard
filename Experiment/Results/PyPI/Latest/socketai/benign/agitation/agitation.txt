      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate inference pipeline with no embedded malicious code. The primary security risk stems from external model file trustworthiness. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the potential threat from external files, assuming they are trusted. Implementing checksum verification for the model file is recommended for production environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing model files with integrity checks. No malicious, obfuscated, or malicious behavior is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to trust in external sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, which is justified given the network activity and file operations. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's behavior."

It performs standard data loading and label conversion routines without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature."
