  "purpose": "Data loading, preprocessing, and label conversion for medical imaging inference pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input data from external imaging files via LoadImaged; configuration parameters for bin ranges and number of bins.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction outputs; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> LoadImaged -> Orientationd -> CenterSpatialCropd -> ScaleIntensityd -> SoftLabelToPred conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries (torch, monai) for data transformation and label processing. The class SoftLabelToPred computes scalar predictions from softmax outputs based on configurable bin ranges, which is typical in regression tasks. The LoadVolume class chains common transforms for medical image preprocessing. No external network calls, file writes, or obfuscation patterns are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices for such pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard data loading and label conversion routines without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
