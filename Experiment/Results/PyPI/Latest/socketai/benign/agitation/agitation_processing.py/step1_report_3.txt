{
  "purpose": "The code defines preprocessing and postprocessing functions for handling medical imaging data, including conversion of model predictions and data loading transformations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from 'config', input tensors for softmax conversion, and image data files during loading.",
  "sinks": "Tensor computations involving model predictions, data transformations during inference, and data loading processes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through soft label conversion, and from image data files through various transformations during inference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious system modifications. The code uses standard libraries and common image processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs model prediction conversion and data loading transformations. It accesses configuration parameters, manipulates tensors, and applies standard image processing steps. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or system compromise is observed. No anomalous or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of preprocessing and postprocessing routines for medical imaging inference. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
