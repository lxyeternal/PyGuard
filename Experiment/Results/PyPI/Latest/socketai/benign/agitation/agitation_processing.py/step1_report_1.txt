  "purpose": "The code defines data processing and model prediction utility functions for medical imaging analysis, including loading images and converting soft labels to hard labels.",
  "sources": "Configuration values from 'config' (MOTION_BIN_RANGE, MOTION_N_BINS), input tensor 'x' in 'softmax_to_hardlabel', and data from external image files via 'LoadImaged'.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of model predictions to numerical labels, data loaded and processed for inference pipeline, no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data from image files -> loaded and preprocessed -> model prediction soft labels -> conversion to hard labels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Usage of torch and monai libraries appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (torch, monai) for medical imaging preprocessing and prediction handling. The 'SoftLabelToPred' class converts softmax outputs into scalar predictions using configurable bin ranges. The 'LoadVolume' class chains multiple transformations for inference data loading, with no external network or system modification. The use of configuration parameters suggests flexibility, but no malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes within an AI inference pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focusing on data loading and label conversion in a medical imaging context. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies.",
