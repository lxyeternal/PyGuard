  "purpose": "Perform inference on neuroimaging datasets using a pre-trained TorchScript model, parsing datasets, and saving motion scores.",
  "sources": "Dataset paths, model file at config.MODEL_PATH, CSV input file (if provided)",
  "sinks": "Model inference (model(data)), DataFrame creation and concatenation, CSV output file",
  "flows": "Dataset paths → glob/regex parsing → dataset creation → DataLoader → model inference → DataFrame → CSV output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard dataset handling, model loading, and CLI operations",
  "analysis": "The code loads a TorchScript model via torch.jit.load without validation, processes datasets with standard globbing and regex, and performs inference. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external files (model and datasets). The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or backdoors. External dependencies (model file) could be malicious if tampered with, but this is a common supply chain risk, not an embedded malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate inference pipeline with no embedded malicious code. The primary security risk stems from external model file trustworthiness. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the potential threat from external files, assuming they are trusted. Implementing checksum verification for the model file is recommended for production environments.",
