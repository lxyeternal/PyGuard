{
  "purpose": "This module defines functions for motion inference on MRI datasets, including dataset parsing, session detection, and running a deep learning model for motion estimation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include dataset paths, CSV files, and glob patterns for T1-weighted images; data is read via pandas, glob, and regex matches.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be passed into model inference, and outputs include a DataFrame of motion scores saved to CSV. There is no indication of data leaks or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Paths and dataset descriptions are processed from inputs, matched via regex or glob, then converted into dataset objects for inference. Model outputs are converted into DataFrame and saved; no external network communication is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling suggests normal operation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads models, datasets, and performs inference within a well-defined pipeline. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration methods are implemented. Functions for dataset detection and path parsing are standard. No hidden or malicious logic is evident. The only potential concern could be reliance on external model files and data sources, but this is typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate dataset processing and deep learning inference without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. There are no anomalies or malicious signals detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
