  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate inference pipeline with no embedded malicious code. The primary security risk stems from external model file trustworthiness. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects the potential threat from external files, assuming they are trusted. Implementing checksum verification for the model file is recommended for production environments."
