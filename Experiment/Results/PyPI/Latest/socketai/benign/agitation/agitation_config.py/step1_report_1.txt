{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for data directory, model path, and a remote URL for downloading a file.",
  "sources": "os and platformdirs modules, user_data_dir function, string literals for URL and MD5, variable assignments for constants.",
  "sinks": "The ZENODO_URL might be used to download external files, potentially leading to data exfiltration if misused.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or untrusted input processing present; constants are hardcoded with fixed values.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to an external resource for a model file, but no code is shown for downloading or executing it. No suspicious code structures or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines constants for directory paths and external URLs. There is no code executing external requests, no dynamic code execution, nor does it handle untrusted input. The URL is a static link to a known repository. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a static configuration setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no executable code beyond defining constants and references an external URL, which is typical for model or data loading. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
