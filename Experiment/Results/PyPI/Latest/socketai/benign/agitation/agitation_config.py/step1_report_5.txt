{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants including data directory, model path, download URL, and parameters for motion processing.",
  "sources": "os and platformdirs modules for directory path; hardcoded URL and MD5 checksum; constant variables for parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules to determine a user data directory, then defines constants for model storage, download URL, checksum, and motion parameters. There are no user inputs, no network operations, or code execution. The URL is a public download link, and the MD5 checksum appears standard. The code is purely static configuration with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module with no malicious intent. It only sets constants for data paths and parameters, with a publicly available URL and checksum. No security risks or malware are present.",
