{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for data directory, model path, and download URL for a machine learning application.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data via 'user_data_dir' to determine data storage location.",
  "sinks": "The URL string 'ZENODO_URL' could be used to download external files; however, it is a static URL and not an untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the URL is hardcoded, and no user input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials beyond URL and MD5, or hidden backdoors. The URL and MD5 are publicly available resources, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for data storage, model path, and external download URL, all using static values. The 'user_data_dir' is a legitimate method to determine user-specific data directory, with no input handling or untrusted data processing. The URL and MD5 are hardcoded, typical for resource links in model deployment setups. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration module with no malicious behavior. It specifies paths and URLs for model files and data directories in a standard way, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
