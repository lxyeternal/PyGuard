  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code only defines constants; no active code, no network requests, no execution.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report’s confidence is high; the conclusion is justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is static configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, similar to Report 1, only constants are defined.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The conclusion is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code only defines constants, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since it only defines static constants, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high but still negligible; perhaps 0 is more appropriate unless considering the external URL as a minor risk.\n- **Assessment:** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, similar to previous reports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report’s conclusion aligns.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is purely static configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree there is no malicious activity. **Set to 0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; **set to 0**.\n- **Risk score:** All reports suggest minimal or no security risk, with some assigning 0.1 perhaps overly cautious. Given the code's static nature, **a risk score of 0** is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static configuration constants, no code execution, no network activity, no secrets or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward static configuration module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores should all be zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
