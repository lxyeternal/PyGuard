{
  "purpose": "Define static configuration constants for data directory, model path, external resource URLs, and parameters used in the application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL strings, MD5 checksum, environment-based data directory retrieval",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution logic present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines constants for data paths, URLs, and parameters. All URLs are public and linked to known repositories. No dynamic code, network requests, or secret handling is present. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign static configuration module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
