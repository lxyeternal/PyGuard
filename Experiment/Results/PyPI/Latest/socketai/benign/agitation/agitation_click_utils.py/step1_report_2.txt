  "purpose": "Helper module defining functions for handling command-line usage errors with styled messages using the 'click' library.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user interactions via command-line arguments or messages passed to the usage_fail function.",
  "sinks": "The usage_fail function raises a click.UsageError, which can terminate the program or be caught by higher-level error handlers.",
  "flows": "Input message flows from function parameter to being styled and then used in raising a UsageError, terminating execution if invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard click features for error reporting. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a utility function to raise a styled usage error message. No external data sources, no data flows to external sinks, and no suspicious constructs are present. It relies on the 'click' library for error handling, which is standard for command-line interfaces. The style function is used appropriately for formatting the error message, and the function raises an exception to signal usage errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign helper for command-line error reporting using the 'click' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs a standard utility role within CLI applications.",
