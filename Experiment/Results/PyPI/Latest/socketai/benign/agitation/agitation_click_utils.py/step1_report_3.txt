  "sources": "User input or command-line arguments (implied, not explicitly shown in code)",
  "sinks": "Raises a click.UsageError with styled message",
  "flows": "User input -> invocation of usage_fail() -> raising click.UsageError",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard click functions for error reporting",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'click' library and defines a function that raises a styled UsageError. There are no hidden code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious data handling. The function is a straightforward helper for consistent error messages, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign helper function for error handling in a CLI application. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears safe and standard.",
