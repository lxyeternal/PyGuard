It uses standard click library functions correctly, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The purpose is to provide consistent CLI error reporting. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for CLI error handling with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
