  "purpose": "Set main entrypoint for CLI commands using 'click' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'manage' and 'inference_cli' command functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Registration of imported command functions under CLI group; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI setup using 'click', importing command functions from internal modules and registering them. It contains no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0—are appropriate. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious given the simplicity of the code. No evidence suggests any vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious behavior justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate; the slight securityRisk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for precision. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
