{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load CSV data and generate various plots related to motion tracking, such as 3D trajectories, 2D projections, position vs time, joint angles, motor currents, velocity, acceleration, and deviation analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data exclusively from CSV files specified by the input paths in various plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plots using matplotlib; there are no sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that affects system security, such as executing code, writing files, or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV file input into data dictionaries, which are then used to generate plots. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to system command execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and primarily focused on data visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with multiple static methods to load CSV data and generate various plots for motion analysis. It uses standard libraries (csv, matplotlib) without any dynamic code execution or external network communication. The CSV reading is straightforward with no suspicious parsing or command execution. The plotting functions only process numerical data to generate visualizations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be benign, serving a purely analytical purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data visualization utility for motion data analysis. It only reads from CSV files and produces plots without performing any suspicious or malicious actions. There are no signs of malware, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
