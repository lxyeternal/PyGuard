{
  "purpose": "The code defines a static plotting utility class for visualizing CSV data related to robotic trajectories, joint angles, motor currents, velocities, accelerations, and deviations.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files specified by csv_path parameter in various plotting methods, primarily through the _load_csv method which opens and reads CSV files using open() and csv.DictReader.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, which is standard for visualization; no other sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "CSV data is read from specified file paths into internal data structures; then, data is processed for plotting, with no untrusted data being written elsewhere or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements. The data processing appears straightforward. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides static visualization functions for CSV data, with well-structured data loading and plotting routines. It reads data from CSV files and creates plots without executing any external commands, network operations, or writing to sensitive locations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external interactions, and no obfuscated code segments. The functions are standard and focused on visualization tasks, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for plotting CSV data related to robotic trajectories and measurements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious payloads. It is safe from a cybersecurity perspective.",
