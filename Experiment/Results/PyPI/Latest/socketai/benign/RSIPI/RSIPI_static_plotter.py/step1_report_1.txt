{
  "purpose": "This code provides various static plotting functions for visualizing CSV data related to TCP trajectory, joint angles, motor currents, velocity, acceleration, and deviations between actual and planned paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from CSV files specified by the user through function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to system files outside the scope of input, or interact with external processes in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV files (sources), processed within the functions (e.g., calculations for velocity and acceleration), and then visualized using matplotlib plotting functions (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward data loading and plotting; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. No hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of data loading from CSV files and visualization using matplotlib. The data loading is done via csv.DictReader with standard parsing. Calculations for velocities and accelerations are basic numerical differences. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, system modifications, or hidden code. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data visualization utility for CSV-based telemetry or robotic motion data. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this code. It is safe to use, assuming the CSV data itself is from a trusted source.",
