{
  "purpose": "The code provides static methods for loading CSV data and plotting various aspects of TCP trajectory, joint angles, motor currents, velocities, accelerations, and deviations for analysis and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV files via the _load_csv method, specifically from the 'csv_path' parameter passed to each plotting function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files into the _load_csv method, then into plotting functions that generate visualizations. No untrusted data is forwarded beyond local processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. All code appears standard for data visualization.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for CSV reading and plotting, defines a class with static methods for loading data and plotting various graphs. Data is read from specified CSV files, processed into numeric lists, and used for plotting. No network, environment variables, or system commands are used. The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is solely focused on data visualization based on input CSV files, with proper separation of concerns and no suspicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data visualization utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles CSV input securely, with no evident data leakage or harmful behavior.",
