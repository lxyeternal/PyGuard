  "purpose": "The code loads CSV data related to robotic motion parameters and visualizes various aspects such as trajectories, joint angles, motor currents, velocities, accelerations, and deviations through plotting functions.",
  "sources": "CSV files containing timestamped data for positions, joint angles, forces, velocities, and deviations.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that generate visualizations; no external network or file modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSV files, processed (e.g., velocity and acceleration calculations), and then passed to plotting functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Minor note: acceleration calculations assume uniform sampling intervals without explicitly considering timestamp differences, which could affect accuracy but not security.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CSV data loading and plotting routines without external network interactions or system modifications. It processes position data to compute velocities and accelerations, then visualizes these metrics. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The calculations assume uniform sampling intervals, which could be refined by incorporating actual timestamp differences, but this does not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code is straightforward, benign, and focused on data visualization for robotic motion analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
