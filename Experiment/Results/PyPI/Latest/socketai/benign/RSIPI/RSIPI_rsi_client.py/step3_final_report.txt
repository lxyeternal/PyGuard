  "purpose": "Manage network communication, configuration parsing, and process/thread lifecycle for RSI client.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, network settings, internal variables, multiprocessing and threading events.",
  "sinks": "Network process creation, event signaling for start/stop, thread management.",
  "flows": "Configuration parsing -> network settings -> process/thread control signals -> network process lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages subprocesses and threads for network communication using standard Python modules. It reads configuration data, creates and controls network processes, and handles start/stop signals via multiprocessing events. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The process management appears robust, with proper cleanup and reconnection logic. No external data leaks or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical network client managing subprocesses and threading with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
