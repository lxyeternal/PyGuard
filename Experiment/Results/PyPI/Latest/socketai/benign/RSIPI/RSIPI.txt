      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization GUI with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external module, which is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments to malware and risk scores in report 2 to better reflect suspicion. No evidence of high malicious intent is present, but structural complexity and obfuscation signs justify moderate concern. The current scoring system is appropriate, and no significant changes are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical network client managing subprocesses and threading with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but within this code, it is safe."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "This CLI wrapper around RSIAPI is structurally safe and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security risks stem from unvalidated user inputs and the trustworthiness of external files or scripts used in commands like 'inject_rsi'. Ensuring input validation and secure handling of external files would reduce potential attack vectors. Overall, the code is safe assuming RSIAPI's internal security and proper input handling."
