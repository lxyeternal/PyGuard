  "purpose": "Real-time plotting and alerting of RSI data including position, velocity, acceleration, and force, with optional planned trajectory overlay.",
  "sources": "RSIClient.receive_variables for live data; CSV plan file for planned trajectory; system time for timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for deviation and force alerts; matplotlib plots for visualization.",
  "flows": "Data from RSIClient and CSV loaded into deques; derivatives computed; deviations compared to planned data; alerts triggered; data plotted periodically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected. Use of print statements for alerts is standard. Timestamp formatting as string may cause long-term plotting issues but not security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured real-time data visualization tool with alerting capabilities. It reads data from a client object and CSV files, computes derivatives, compares with planned data, and plots the results. Alerts are printed to the console when thresholds are exceeded. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Minor issues include timestamp string formatting and potential duplicate data appending in load_plan, but these do not impact security. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard real-time RSI data visualization and alerting utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The assigned scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
