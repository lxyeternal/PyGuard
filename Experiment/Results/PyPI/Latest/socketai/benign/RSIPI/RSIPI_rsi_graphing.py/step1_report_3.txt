{
  "purpose": "The code provides real-time plotting and analysis of RSI data for position, velocity, acceleration, and force, with optional overlay of planned trajectories and alert mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads data from RSIClient.receive_variables, CSV files for planned trajectories and logs, and system time.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for plotting; prints alert messages to the console upon deviations or force spikes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from RSIClient.receive_variables to data buffers, then to plots; thresholds trigger alert messages based on data comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No suspicious data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data collection, computation, and visualization for RSI monitoring. It reads input data from a client object and CSV files, processes this data to compute derivatives, and plots it live or from logs. Alerts are triggered via console messages based on deviations and force thresholds. No suspicious or malicious activity such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The code operates within standard data processing and visualization paradigms without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization utility for RSI monitoring with alert features. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
