{
  "purpose": "This code provides real-time plotting and monitoring of RSI data, including position, velocity, acceleration, and force metrics, with support for overlays and alerts.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the RSIClient instance via receive_variables (for position and force data), CSV files (for planned trajectories and logs), and system time functions (time.time, time.strftime).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; however, print statements output alerts based on data thresholds, which could be used for information leakage if monitored externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from RSIClient.receive_variables to plotting buffers; thresholds trigger alerts; CSV files are read for plan loading and plotting; data is visualized with matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. The code relies on standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a live data visualization setup, periodically updating plots with real-time data from RSIClient. It computes derivatives and compares current positions with planned data, issuing alerts if deviations or force spikes occur. The use of CSV files for plans and logs is straightforward. No suspicious network activities, hidden code, or malicious data handling mechanisms are detected. All functions are related to plotting, data processing, or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data visualization and monitoring tool for RSI metrics, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads and displays data, triggers alerts based on thresholds, and can load plan data from CSV files. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
