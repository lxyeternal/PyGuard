  "purpose": "Load and parse RSI configuration XML files, extracting network settings, variable templates, and optional safety limits.",
  "sources": "XML files specified by config_file and rsi_limits_file; external parse_rsi_limits function.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures (dictionaries) storing parsed data; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "XML data read into internal dictionaries; no external network or code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Logging is optional and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard XML parsing with exception handling, processes known internal variables, and structures variables hierarchically. It does not execute untrusted code or contain obfuscation. The external function parse_rsi_limits is a dependency whose security depends on its implementation, but its usage here is controlled. No malicious patterns, code injection, or unsafe practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but within this code, it is safe.",
