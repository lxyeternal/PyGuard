  "purpose": "Load and parse RSI Ethernet configuration files and safety limits, structuring variables for communication.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files (XML files: config_file and rsi_limits_file), parsing with ET.parse, reading environment or user input is not present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; data is processed internally, and logging is conditional without including sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from XML files into internal data structures, with no evident untrusted data influencing control flow or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard parsing logic, no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Logging can be enabled or disabled, but this alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads and processes XML configuration files, transforming their contents into structured Python dictionaries. It includes functions to clean variable tags, process known internal variables, and structure custom variables based on their types. The optional safety limits loader depends on an external parser. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads. The only notable feature is conditional logging, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate configuration parsing and variable structuring with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is well-structured for its intended purpose and does not contain malware indicators or security risks.",
