  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. External dependencies should be reviewed separately, but within this code, it is safe."
