  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration parser with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external module, which is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk."
