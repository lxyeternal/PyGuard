  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments to malware and risk scores in report 2 to better reflect suspicion. No evidence of high malicious intent is present, but structural complexity and obfuscation signs justify moderate concern. The current scoring system is appropriate, and no significant changes are necessary."
