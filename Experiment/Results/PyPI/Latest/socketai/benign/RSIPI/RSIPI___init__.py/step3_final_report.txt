  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the provided Python code snippets or reports.",
  "sources": "Imports, environment variables, data flows from untrusted sources, code structure, comments, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "System/network operations, data exfiltration points, file modifications, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Sources (e.g., environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network connections, file writes).",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious import patterns, lack of comments, obfuscation signs, data flow from untrusted sources, incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally correctly identify the absence of code or malicious activity, with some suspicion in reports 2 and 5 due to complex imports and signs of obfuscation. Scores are mostly consistent with the described content. Report 2 shows structural complexity and potential data flow concerns, warranting a slight increase in malware score from 0.1 to around 0.3, and security risk from 0.3 to approximately 0.4-0.5. Other reports correctly score zero or low, reflecting the lack of evidence. The assessments are cautious and aligned with best practices for supply chain security review.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments to malware and risk scores in report 2 to better reflect suspicion. No evidence of high malicious intent is present, but structural complexity and obfuscation signs justify moderate concern. The current scoring system is appropriate, and no significant changes are necessary.",
