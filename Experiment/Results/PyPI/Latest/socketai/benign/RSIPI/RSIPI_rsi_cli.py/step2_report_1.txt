  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The CLI is a wrapper around RSIAPI, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is reliance on RSIAPI's security, not the CLI itself.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, considering potential RSIAPI vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report is reasonable; the code appears safe assuming RSIAPI is secure.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, but emphasizes the risk of unvalidated inputs, especially for commands like `inject_rsi`, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no direct malware, but notes potential for malicious injection if RSIAPI or input files are compromised.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — higher due to potential injection points.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the main concern is the lack of validation, which could be exploited if RSIAPI or files are malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on the `inject_rsi` command and potential for malicious RSI scripts if input files are compromised.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, considering possible malicious RSI scripts.\n- **Security risk:** 0.4.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the idea that the primary risk is external file content and RSIAPI's handling.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- **Findings:** Both emphasize that the CLI is a straightforward wrapper with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main concern is reliance on RSIAPI and unvalidated inputs, but no actual malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The assessments are reasonable; the code itself appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree that there is no evidence of malicious code embedded in this CLI wrapper. The highest malware score is 0.2 (due to potential malicious RSI scripts in external files), but overall, the code itself does not exhibit malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** The primary concern is external input handling, especially for commands involving file injection or configuration (`inject_rsi`, `parse_krl_to_csv`). The risk is moderate but depends heavily on the RSIAPI's own security and the trustworthiness of input files.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code present within this script.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** **0.3** — moderate risk due to unvalidated inputs and external file handling, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Note:** The overall security posture hinges on RSIAPI's implementation and the integrity of external files used in commands like `inject_rsi`. If RSIAPI is secure and inputs are validated, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard command-line interface wrapper around RSIAPI, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security considerations involve ensuring RSIAPI handles inputs securely and that external files used in commands are trusted.",
