  "purpose": "A command-line interface for controlling RSI robotic system functions, issuing commands to an RSIAPI client.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user input via the input() function in run(), and command arguments are parsed from the input string.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the RSIAPI client methods such as start_rsi(), stop_rsi(), update_variable(), move_cartesian_trajectory(), inject_rsi(), and others, which likely interface with robotic hardware or network services.",
  "flows": "User input → process_command() → parsing commands and arguments → calling RSIAPI methods with untrusted parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code processes user-provided arguments directly without validation for critical functions, such as 'inject_rsi', 'move_external', 'correct', 'set_alert_threshold', and trajectory commands, which could be manipulated to cause unsafe robot movements or data injection. There are no explicit security checks or sanitization. The method inject_rsi accepts filenames and configuration parameters, potentially allowing arbitrary file injection if not validated. The use of 'input()' for command input could lead to command injection if the underlying RSIAPI methods are vulnerable.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a command-line wrapper around the RSIAPI class, translating user commands into API calls. It accepts raw user input and parses it into commands and arguments, which are directly passed to RSIAPI methods. Critical functions like 'inject_rsi' involve file paths and configuration parameters, which if supplied maliciously, could lead to arbitrary code execution or configuration corruption. The use of 'input()' and direct argument passing without validation is a security concern. The script does not include sanitization or authentication, thus potentially allowing malicious commands or data to reach the RSIAPI layer. The presence of command parsing logic that dynamically calls various methods indicates potential risk if the underlying methods do not handle validation properly.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is primarily a command dispatcher; the main security concern depends on the safety of the RSIAPI methods it invokes. Since user inputs are passed directly to these methods without validation or sanitization, and some commands involve file paths or configuration parameters, there is a risk of injection or malicious configuration if inputs are maliciously crafted. Overall, the script does not implement security controls, but the primary risk stems from its reliance on the RSIAPI implementation and the unvalidated user inputs.",
