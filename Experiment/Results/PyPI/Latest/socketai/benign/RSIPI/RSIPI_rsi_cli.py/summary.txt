  "conclusion": "This CLI wrapper around RSIAPI is structurally safe and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security risks stem from unvalidated user inputs and the trustworthiness of external files or scripts used in commands like 'inject_rsi'. Ensuring input validation and secure handling of external files would reduce potential attack vectors. Overall, the code is safe assuming RSIAPI's internal security and proper input handling."
