  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The CLI acts as a wrapper around RSIAPI, with no malicious code. Inputs are directly passed to API methods, but no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to reliance on RSIAPI security)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent detected. The main concern is RSIAPI's security, not the CLI code itself.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential injection via 'inject_rsi' and unvalidated inputs. Highlights that malicious RSI scripts could be injected if input files are compromised.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, due to potential for malicious RSI scripts)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; the main vulnerability is in the potential for malicious input files or commands, not the CLI code itself.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on 'inject_rsi' command as a possible vector for malicious RSI scripts. No malicious code in CLI, but risk depends on RSIAPI's handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (some concern but not confirmed malicious)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, mainly due to external file handling)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the potential risk of malicious RSI scripts if inputs are compromised.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others; no malicious code or obfuscation. Risks depend on RSIAPI implementation and input validation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign; main concern is external API security.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Overall benign, straightforward CLI wrapper. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on zero malware presence. The CLI code itself does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Most reports assign low risk (~0.2 to 0.4), mainly due to reliance on the security of RSIAPI and potential for malicious input files or commands.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2 to 0.3** — primarily stemming from unvalidated user inputs and external file handling, which could be exploited if RSIAPI or input files are malicious.\n\n**Final justification:**  \nThe code functions as a command-line interface wrapper around RSIAPI, with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of RSIAPI and the validation of user-provided files and commands. Given the evidence, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect minimal inherent risk, mainly external dependencies and input handling)\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the reports' consensus and the analysis of the code structure.",
