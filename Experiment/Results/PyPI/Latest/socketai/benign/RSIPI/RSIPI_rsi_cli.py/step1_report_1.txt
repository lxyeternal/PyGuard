  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for controlling RSI API functions related to robotic system management, including movement, safety, logging, visualization, and configuration.",
  "sources": "User input from the terminal via input(), command arguments parsed from input strings, and external files for injection, parsing, and exporting data.",
  "sinks": "Calls to RSIAPI methods that perform system actions, file operations, or network communications based on user commands.",
  "flows": "User input -> command parser -> matching command -> RSIAPI method calls with parameters derived from user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for command input without sanitization; potential for command injection if RSIAPI methods do not handle parameters securely; reliance on user-provided arguments for file paths and configuration values; injection of parameters into methods such as inject_rsi and parse_krl_to_csv without validation; no evident encryption or security checks on data or commands.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a command-line interface that interprets user input into system commands executed via RSIAPI. It includes multiple command options for system control, movement, data visualization, and configuration. The parsing of commands and parameters is straightforward, with no evident input validation or sanitization, which might pose risks if RSIAPI methods do not handle malicious input securely. The code itself does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond invoking RSIAPI methods. The use of input() for command input and direct passing of arguments into API functions could be exploited if RSIAPI implementations are vulnerable, but the CLI code itself does not introduce malicious behaviors. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the script functions as a command interface without malicious intent or malicious code embedded within it.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard command-line interface wrapper for RSIAPI functions with no embedded malicious code. It mainly processes user commands and calls API functions accordingly. Potential security concerns are mainly related to the use of user inputs and their handling in the RSIAPI methods, not from the CLI code itself. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration within this code. Overall, the script appears safe assuming RSIAPI methods are secure and properly implemented.",
