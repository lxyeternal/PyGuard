{
  "purpose": "The code parses KUKA robot control files (.src and .dat) to extract TCP setpoints and exports them into a CSV format for further analysis or use.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by src_file and dat_file variables; opens files with open() function, reads lines, and applies regex patterns to extract data.",
  "sinks": "Writes output CSV file via csv.DictWriter; logs warnings and info messages via logging module.",
  "flows": "Extracts labels from .src file, retrieves corresponding coordinates from .dat file, then writes structured data to CSV, skipping missing points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Uses regex for parsing; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file parsing with regex, extracting specific data points, and outputs a CSV. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or hidden actions. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code patterns detected. The use of standard libraries (csv, re, logging) and simple file I/O indicates typical data processing. The code is well-structured, with clear intentions, and contains no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for parsing robot control files. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, purpose-specific parser with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
