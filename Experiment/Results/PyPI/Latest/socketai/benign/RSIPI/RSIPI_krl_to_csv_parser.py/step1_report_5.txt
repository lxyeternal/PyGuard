{
  "purpose": "This code parses KUKA KRL .src and .dat files to extract TCP setpoints and exports them into a CSV format.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'self.src_file' and 'self.dat_file' through open() calls.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to a CSV file via csv.DictWriter; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "File reading source -> data parsing with regex -> data storage in class attributes -> CSV writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of regex is straightforward; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected. No external network calls or sensitive data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class to parse specific robot control files and export data. It reads input files with open(), uses regex for pattern matching, and writes output to a CSV. No indications of malicious payloads, network activity, or privacy violations are found. The code is standard for its purpose and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate parser for KUKA robot files with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward file parsing, data extraction, and CSV export without any suspicious operations.",
