{
  "purpose": "Parse KUKA robot control files (.src and .dat), extract TCP setpoints, and export them into a structured CSV format.",
  "sources": "Reads .src file to extract motion command labels; reads .dat file to retrieve Cartesian coordinates for each label.",
  "sinks": "Writes extracted position data into a CSV file.",
  "flows": "Extracts labels from .src via regex, then retrieves corresponding coordinates from .dat, and outputs structured CSV entries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file parsing using regex, with standard libraries. It reads input files, extracts labels and coordinates, and writes to CSV. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. It handles missing data gracefully and maintains order with OrderedDict. The logic is clear, purpose-specific, and secure against common vulnerabilities. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built parser for robotic control files with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to handling untrusted input files, but contains no malicious behavior.",
