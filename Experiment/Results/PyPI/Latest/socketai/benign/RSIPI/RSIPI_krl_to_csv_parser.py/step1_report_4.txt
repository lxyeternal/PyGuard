{
  "purpose": "Parse KUKA robot control files (.src and .dat) to extract TCP setpoints and export them as CSV.",
  "sources": "File reads from self.src_file and self.dat_file, and reading lines with regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Writing to output CSV file specified by output_file parameter.",
  "flows": "Reads input files, processes data with regex, stores in memory, then writes structured CSV.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Usage of regex and file operations appear standard. No obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or malicious system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input files (.src and .dat) using regex to extract labels and coordinate data, then exports this data into CSV format. It performs straightforward file I/O, data parsing, and CSV writing. No external or untrusted data sources are used beyond reading local files. There is no code that performs network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears as a legitimate data parsing utility for robotic control files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard parser for specific robot control files, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs file reading, regex parsing, and CSV exporting in a typical manner. No security risks or malware detected.",
