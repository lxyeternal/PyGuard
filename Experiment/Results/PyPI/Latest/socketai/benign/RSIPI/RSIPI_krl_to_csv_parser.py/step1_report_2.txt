  "purpose": "Parse KUKA KRL .src and .dat files to extract TCP setpoints and export them as CSV.",
  "sources": "File reads for self.src_file and self.dat_file; regex searches on file lines.",
  "sinks": "File write for output CSV; logging statements.",
  "flows": "Reading source files, parsing data, storing in memory, then writing CSV output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. The code handles files securely and performs straightforward parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input files specified via class attributes, performs regex-based extraction of motion commands and positional data, and exports structured CSV data. The use of open() with provided file paths is standard, with no evident malicious data handling or obfuscated code. Logging is used for warnings and info, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or system disruption code. The code appears to perform its intended purpose safely, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It does not dynamically execute code, connect to external networks, or access environment variables in a malicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard file parser and exporter for specific robotic data files. No malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain risks are evident. It operates as intended without suspicious anomalies.",
