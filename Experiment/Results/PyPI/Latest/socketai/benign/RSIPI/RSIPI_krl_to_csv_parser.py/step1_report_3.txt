{
  "purpose": "The code parses KUKA KRL source and data files to extract robotic motion points and export them into a CSV format for further use or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads from the .src file for motion commands, and the .dat file for Cartesian coordinate definitions.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a CSV file; no other external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads labels from the .src file, retrieves corresponding coordinates from the .dat file, then writes structured CSV data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing of specific file formats related to robot programming. It uses regular expressions to identify motion commands and coordinate definitions, then writes structured data to a CSV file. All operations involve reading and writing files without executing or interpreting external or untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The use of standard libraries and typical parsing logic indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate parser for KUKA robot files with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It only reads specified files, processes data, and outputs a CSV, with no network activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
