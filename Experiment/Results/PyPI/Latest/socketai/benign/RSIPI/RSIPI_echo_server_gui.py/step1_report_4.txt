{
  "purpose": "The code provides a graphical user interface for running and visualising a RSI Echo Server, displaying robot position and joint data along with message logs.",
  "sources": "User input for config file path, mode, delay, and show_robot checkbox; data from the EchoServer object (e.g., server.state, server.last_received).",
  "sinks": "Display of messages in Tkinter Text widgets; plotting data on matplotlib 3D axes; server start/stop commands; access to server.state and server methods.",
  "flows": "User inputs (config file, mode, delay) -> start_server() initializes EchoServer -> update_visualisation() continuously reads server.state and updates GUI and plots -> server generates messages -> displayed in Text widgets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access evident. The code mainly creates GUI and visualizes data from the server.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Tkinter GUI to control and monitor an EchoServer instance. It uses standard libraries for UI, threading, and plotting, and imports a custom server module. The server is started in a separate thread, and data visualization occurs periodically. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected. The message handling appears straightforward, with message logs displayed in text boxes. No suspicious network connections or malicious behavior is found within the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate GUI tool for visualizing robot data from an EchoServer. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The functionality is consistent with standard visualization and server control, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
