  "purpose": "Provides a GUI for controlling and visualizing the RSI Echo Server, displaying robot TCP positions, joint states, and message logs.",
  "sources": "Reads user inputs from GUI elements (config file path, mode, delay, show robot toggle), and retrieves server state data (position, joint angles).",
  "sinks": "Updates GUI text boxes with message logs and visualizes data on matplotlib 3D plot; no external data sinks or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> GUI controls -> server configuration; server state -> visualization updates; message logs -> GUI display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. External module usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GUI wrapper around an external server class, managing server lifecycle, visualization, and message display. It uses standard libraries, handles threading properly, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network exfiltration are present. The server object is external but used in a typical manner. The visual and message update mechanisms are local and controlled. Minor logical considerations exist but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization GUI with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
