{
  "purpose": "Provides a graphical user interface to run, visualize, and log the RSI Echo Server for robot TCP and joint data, including live 3D plotting and message display.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file path from file dialog and user input variables; accesses server state for robot position and joint data; interacts with server methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses server state data for visualization; updates text boxes with received and sent messages; calls server start/stop methods.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger file browsing and server start; server data flows into visualization updates and message displays; server commands initiate start/stop actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a GUI to control and visualize an external RSI Echo Server, relying on imported modules and server state. It reads configuration files, manages server lifecycle, and updates visualization and message logs. All interactions are standard for a visualization tool and do not perform any hidden or suspicious operations. The server communication is straightforward, with no evident data exfiltration or malicious activity. The only external interaction is with the server object, which appears to be a legitimate component imported from src.RSIPI.rsi_echo_server. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malware signatures are present. The code focuses on visualization and user control without performing unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GUI interface for visualizing and controlling a robot echo server. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. There are no security risks identified in this code snippet. The overall security risk score is low, with high confidence that the code is benign.",
