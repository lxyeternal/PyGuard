  "purpose": "Handles UDP network communication, data processing, and optional logging in a separate process for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads network data via UDP socket; reads configuration via config_parser; reads variables for sending/receiving; reads stop_event and start_event controls.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket.sendto() to send generated XML data; reads and decodes incoming UDP data; processes XML data which may contain untrusted input; writes logs if enabled.",
  "flows": "Receives UDP data -> parses XML -> updates receive_variables -> modifies send_variables -> generates XML -> sends via socket; also logs data if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Uses dynamic XML generation and socket communication. No obfuscated code features or unusual constructs. The process listens and responds on network, but no suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code manages UDP communication with validation of IP addresses, processes incoming XML data, and responds with generated XML. It includes standard socket setup, IP validation, and XML parsing. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present. The network interactions are typical for a networked process, with proper exception handling. Logging is conditional and standard. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behavior detected. The use of sockets and XML processing is standard and appears benign within the scope of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical network communication module without malicious intent. It handles network data safely, with proper validation and error handling. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The overall security risk is low.",
