  "purpose": "Handles UDP communication, XML message parsing, variable updates, and response generation in a separate process, with validation and logging.",
  "sources": "UDP socket receive (recvfrom), XML data received as string, IP validation via socket binding, configuration parser for network settings.",
  "sinks": "XML parsing and variable updates, sending XML responses via UDP socket.",
  "flows": "UDP data received -> XML parsed -> variables updated -> XML generated -> sent via UDP socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network addresses. IP validation binds socket to IP, which could be exploited if input is malicious, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard UDP socket communication with XML parsing, IP validation, and variable management. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling and logging are appropriate. The IP validation method, while potentially exploitable if input is malicious, is a common validation approach. XML parsing uses trusted libraries without external entity vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard network communication module with proper validation and error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
