  "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific neuroimaging processing code with unsafe practices ('eval' and unvalidated system calls) that could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but there is no evidence of malicious payloads or malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score around 0.4 to 0.5 reflecting moderate concern due to unsafe practices."
