  "purpose": "This script performs vertex-wise template matching and network assignment on neuroimaging data, generating GIFTI files for visualization and analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files ('networks_table.csv'), loads neuroimaging data files (.label.gii, .func.gii), and executes system commands for cluster finding and dilation.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'os.system' to run external commands ('wb_command') which could potentially execute arbitrary code or malicious commands if input parameters are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV and GIFTI files, processed in-memory (correlations, similarity calculations), then saved back as GIFTI files. External commands are invoked with parameters that include file paths and thresholds.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' on data read from CSV ('color' column) which could evaluate arbitrary code if the CSV content is maliciously crafted. Also, reliance on external 'os.system' calls introduces potential security risks if parameters are tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical neuroimaging data processing tasks: loading data, calculating correlations, thresholding, similarity computations, and writing results. The 'eval' function on CSV data is a security concern as it can execute arbitrary code. External commands via 'os.system' are a potential attack vector; if input parameters are controlled, malicious commands could be executed. There are no hardcoded credentials or network communications present. The code appears to be standard for neuroimaging analysis but includes some risky practices like 'eval' and 'os.system' calls. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a neuroimaging analysis script with some insecure practices such as use of 'eval' and 'os.system'. These practices pose security risks but do not constitute malware or malicious intent by themselves. Overall security risk is low, but caution should be taken if input parameters are untrusted.",
