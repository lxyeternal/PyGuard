  "purpose": "This code performs neuroimaging data processing, including loading GIFTI files, CSV-based network mappings, computing functional connectivity matrices, similarity measures, and generating labeled GIFTI outputs for network assignment and visualization.",
  "sources": "CSV files for network labels and colors, input GIFTI files for functional data, external commands via 'wb_command' for clustering and dilation, and parameters from the 'params' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "External system calls ('os.system') executing neuroimaging commands, and 'eval' parsing color strings from CSV files, which could execute arbitrary code if CSV content is malicious.",
  "flows": "CSV data (colors) read via pandas -> evaluated with 'eval' -> used in label creation; input GIFTI files -> processed -> external commands invoked with parameters -> output GIFTI files written; no direct untrusted data flows into critical system commands beyond parameter substitution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' to parse color strings from CSV files, and use of 'os.system()' with parameters constructed via string formatting without validation, both pose security risks. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neuroimaging processing with external command calls and data parsing. The use of 'eval' on CSV data is unsafe, as it could execute malicious code if the CSV is crafted maliciously. The 'os.system()' calls for 'wb_command' are potential command injection points if parameters are manipulated, but no validation or sanitization is performed. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The security risks are primarily due to unsafe practices, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific neuroimaging processing code with unsafe practices ('eval' and unvalidated system calls) that could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but there is no evidence of malicious payloads or malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score around 0.4 to 0.5 reflecting moderate concern due to unsafe practices.",
