  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'precision_mapping' Python package, including dependencies, package data, and command-line entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements, setup() function parameters (e.g., find_packages(), install_requires, entry_points, package_data).",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, creation of executable script via entry point.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> setup() configuration -> package installation and script creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The setup configuration appears standard and typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to package a Python project named 'precision_mapping'. It specifies dependencies (numpy, scipy, pandas, nibabel), package data, and creates a command-line script. No external data input, no untrusted data sources, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation are present. The script's purpose is to facilitate packaging and distribution, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
