  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'precision_mapping' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, including find_packages(), install_requires, entry_points, and package_data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without dynamic or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the code does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. The entry point and dependencies are common and benign. The static analysis confirms the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No revisions or additional security measures are necessary.",
