  "purpose": "Define package configuration and setup for the 'precision_mapping' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies ('install_requires'), package data, package discovery via find_packages(), and entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; potential risks include execution of entry point script or data included in package_data.",
  "flows": "Dependencies and package data are specified; the entry point 'precision_mapping.main:main' is set to execute as a console command.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The setup script appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies, package data, and an entry point for command-line execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The package dependencies are common scientific libraries, and the setup process is straightforward. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package without malicious intent. It performs standard package configuration tasks with no suspicious elements detected.",
