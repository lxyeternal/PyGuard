{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'precision_mapping', including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package configuration data such as name, version, packages, entry points, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the script only specifies static configuration for package installation.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data processing; the configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are observed. The code follows standard setup.py structure without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata including name, version, packages found via find_packages(), and specifies an entry point for a command-line script. It lists dependencies such as numpy, scipy, pandas, and nibabel, and includes package data. All code is static configuration data without any input handling, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection. The script is a typical setup configuration used for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and commonly used in Python package distribution.",
