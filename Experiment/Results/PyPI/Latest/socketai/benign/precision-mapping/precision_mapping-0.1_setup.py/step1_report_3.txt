{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'precision_mapping', including package discovery, entry points, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm, such as network operations or file writes based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata and dependency declarations to package data inclusion and console script entry point definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setup.py practices without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions to define package setup parameters. It specifies package name, version, discovery method, console script entry point, dependencies, Python version requirement, and package data files. All components are typical for a Python package setup. No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The setup is straightforward and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely defines package configuration for distribution.",
