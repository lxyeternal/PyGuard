  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging of the 'precision_mapping' Python project, including dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "User inputs from setup() function parameters such as 'install_requires', 'entry_points', and 'package_data'.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, execution of entry point scripts, and access to package data files.",
  "flows": "Installation dependencies are fetched; 'precision_mapping.main:main' is executed as a console script; package data is included during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and data files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated or unusual code structures are present. All functions serve standard packaging purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a normal package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard setup procedures for the 'precision_mapping' package.",
