{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to perform precision functional mapping on neuroimaging data, involving input validation, directory setup, and invoking an external mapping process.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--func, --midthickness, --output), retrieves the executable 'wb_command' from system PATH, and accesses the file name to determine hemisphere.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive inputs (file paths) are passed to external commands via the 'mapping.run(params)' function; directory creation functions may write to specified output locations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and used to generate parameters, which are then passed to the 'mapping.run' function. The script checks for external dependencies and creates directories before execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The script uses standard libraries and straightforward external dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical input validation, directory management, and external process invocation. It checks for the presence of an external tool ('wb_command') and prepares parameters for a mapping pipeline. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. It relies on an external module 'precision_mapping', but without inspecting that module, no malicious activity can be inferred from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard neuroimaging data processing script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages dependencies and directories, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
