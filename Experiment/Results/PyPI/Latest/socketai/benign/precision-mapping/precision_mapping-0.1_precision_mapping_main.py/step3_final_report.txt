  "purpose": "Setup script for neuroimaging data processing, performing dependency checks, argument parsing, directory creation, and delegating processing to an external module.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command-line arguments; derives hemisphere info from filename; checks for 'wb_command' in system path.",
  "sinks": "External function 'mapping.run(params)' invoked; no direct sinks within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parameter preparation -> directory creation -> external 'mapping.run()' call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency verification, argument parsing, parameter setup, directory creation, and calls an external processing function. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The reliance on 'mapping.run()' external function is noted, but without its source, no malicious activity can be inferred. The hemisphere extraction assumes filename format but is not a security concern. Overall, the code is benign and typical for neuroimaging pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, secure setup component with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external modules whose safety cannot be confirmed from this snippet but show no signs of malicious behavior.",
