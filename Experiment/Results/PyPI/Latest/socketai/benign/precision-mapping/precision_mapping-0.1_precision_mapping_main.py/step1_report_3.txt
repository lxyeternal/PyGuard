  "purpose": "This script orchestrates a pipeline for precision functional mapping of neuroimaging data, primarily checking dependencies, parsing command-line arguments, preparing parameters, ensuring directory existence, and invoking an external mapping process.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from command-line arguments, including file paths for functional data, surface data, and output directory. Reads the executable presence via shutil.which().",
  "sinks": "Uses external command 'wb_command' to check for dependencies; calls mapping.run(params) which may invoke external processes or code.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> parameter preparation -> directory setup -> external mapping function call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, secrets, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency checking, argument parsing, parameter setup, directory creation, and invokes an external mapping process. All operations appear standard and intended for neuroimaging data processing. The only external dependency check is for 'wb_command', which is common in neuroimaging workflows. The function 'mapping.run' is imported from an external module; without its source, potential malicious activity cannot be fully ruled out, but based on current code, it appears to be part of a standard processing pipeline. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate neuroimaging data processing script with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external tools and modules but does not exhibit malicious behavior within the provided scope.",
