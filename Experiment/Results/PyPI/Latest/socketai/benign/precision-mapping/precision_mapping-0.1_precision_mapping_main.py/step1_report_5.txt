{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to run a precision functional mapping pipeline on neuroimaging data, involving input validation, directory setup, and invoking an external mapping process.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths (--func, --midthickness, --output) from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the external 'mapping.run' function, which may internally process or handle data, and accesses the filesystem to create directories.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and processed into a parameter dictionary, which is then used by 'mapping.run' to execute the main processing pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly performs input validation, directory setup, and external function invocation without any obfuscated or malicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward operations: dependency check via shutil.which for 'wb_command', argument parsing with argparse, directory creation with os.makedirs, and passing parameters to an external mapping module. No data is transmitted over networks, no system modifications or malicious behaviors are evident. The code relies on external libraries and modules, which are assumed safe. The use of subprocesses or system calls appears limited to the dependency check. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The overall structure and purpose are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard neuroimaging processing wrapper script with no signs of malicious behavior. It safely manages dependencies, inputs, and directories, then delegates processing to an external module. There are no malicious activities or security risks identified.",
