      "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but contains potential risk vectors through network and subprocess operations, and dynamic code execution possibilities. Scores are conservative, with malware at 0.2 and risk at 0.4, aligning with the observed code behavior. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the package appears safe but should be monitored for misuse in specific contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific neuroimaging processing code with unsafe practices ('eval' and unvalidated system calls) that could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but there is no evidence of malicious payloads or malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score around 0.4 to 0.5 reflecting moderate concern due to unsafe practices."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard, secure setup component with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external modules whose safety cannot be confirmed from this snippet but show no signs of malicious behavior."
