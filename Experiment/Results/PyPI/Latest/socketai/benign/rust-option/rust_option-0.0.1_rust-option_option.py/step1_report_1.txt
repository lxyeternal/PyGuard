  "purpose": "Implementation of a generic Option type for handling nullable values safely, with methods for creation, checking, transformation, and retrieval of contained values.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal class methods and static methods that generate Option instances.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of unwrap() could lead to runtime exceptions if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions occur from this method itself.",
  "flows": "Creation of Option instances via static methods; checking or transforming values via methods like is_some, then, or unwrap; untrusted data could flow into an Option via the constructor or new_maybe, but no external input handling is explicitly implemented here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a straightforward implementation of an Option type pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Option class with standard methods to handle optional values, similar to Rust's Option. It includes static methods for creating None or Some instances, and methods for checking state, transforming values, or unwrapping. No external inputs, network operations, or data leaks are present. The only potential risk is misuse of unwrap() which can throw an exception if called on None, but this is consistent with typical Option semantics and not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of an Option type without malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Its design aligns with common safe programming practices.",
