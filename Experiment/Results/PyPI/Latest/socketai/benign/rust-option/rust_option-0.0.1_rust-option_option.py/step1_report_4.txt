{
  "purpose": "This code implements a generic Option type for handling optional values, providing methods for creation, inspection, transformation, and extraction of the contained value.",
  "sources": "No input sources, as this code is a class definition without external data input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, as the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as this is a utility class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and well-structured; no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of type hints and the Option pattern is consistent with functional programming practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic Option class with typical methods for optional value handling, including creation (some, none, new_maybe), checks (is_some, is_none), transformation (then), and extraction (unwrap, unwrap_or). It also provides a custom exception OptionError. No external input or output operations are present, and the methods do not invoke network, filesystem, or subprocess commands. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an Option type for safe handling of optional values in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or external system interactions. The overall security risk is negligible.",
