  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the module named 'option'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from option import *' reads the 'option' module at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; this line alone does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this single line without additional code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered suspicious as it obscures which symbols are imported, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a wildcard import statement. This practice can hide imported symbols and potentially introduce conflicts or obscure malicious functions if present. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The wildcard import is a code style concern but not malicious.",
