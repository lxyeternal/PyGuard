  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the minimal import statement 'from option import *' in a Python module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the 'option' module (contents unknown).",
  "sinks": "Potential namespace pollution leading to obscured symbols; possible hidden malicious code within 'option'.",
  "flows": "Importing all symbols from 'option' into the current namespace; no other data or code flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide malicious or unintended code; lack of context about 'option' module contents.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wildcard import, which is discouraged but not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the risk of namespace pollution and the importance of inspecting 'option'. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), considering the potential for hidden issues if 'option' is malicious. Confidence levels vary but generally indicate a cautious benign stance. The overall assessment is that the snippet is harmless but warrants further review of 'option'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation; primary concern is the unknown contents of 'option'. Scores are consistent with minimal code and cautious analysis. No evidence suggests malicious intent, but the use of 'import *' should be noted as a style and maintainability concern.",
