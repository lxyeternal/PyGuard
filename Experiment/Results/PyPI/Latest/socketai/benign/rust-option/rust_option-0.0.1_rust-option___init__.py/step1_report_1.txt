{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the 'option' module, which could be used for configuration or options handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source; it loads code from an external module named 'option'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential risks depend on the contents of 'option'.",
  "flows": "Not applicable in this minimal code snippet; no data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered unusual or risky as it obscures imported content and may introduce unintended behaviors or conflicts. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a wildcard import from the 'option' module. Without additional context, it's unclear what is being imported. 'import *' can sometimes hide malicious behavior if the imported module contains harmful code, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious actions are directly evident. The snippet does not include any data processing, network activity, or system modification. The minimal nature of the code limits the ability to fully assess security risks, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no overt malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide imported content and potentially introduce risks depending on the 'option' module's contents. No malicious or suspicious activity is directly observable from this snippet alone.",
