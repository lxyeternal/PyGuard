{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, and variables from the module named 'option'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'option' module, which could be a local file or a package.",
  "sinks": "The import itself is a sink, but no further data flow or execution logic is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows in this minimal code snippet; it only imports content from 'option'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure the source of imported elements and may lead to namespace pollution or malicious code hiding within 'option'. However, this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains a single import statement with a wildcard from a module named 'option'. Without additional context, it's impossible to determine if 'option' contains malicious code. The use of '*' can be suspicious as it can hide imported content, but it is a common practice in some cases. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code, are evident. The code is minimal and provides no direct execution or data handling logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious indicators. The use of 'from option import *' can be risky in larger codebases due to namespace pollution but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Further context about the 'option' module is needed to fully assess security risks.",
