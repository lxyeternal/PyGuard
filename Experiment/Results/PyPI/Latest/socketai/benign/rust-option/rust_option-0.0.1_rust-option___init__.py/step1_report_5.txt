{
  "purpose": "Imports all names from the 'option' module, likely to utilize its functions or variables in the script.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source that pulls in external code from the 'option' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly visible in this snippet; the actual usage of imported components would determine potential sinks.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the rest of the code through the imported functions or variables, but no further code is provided to analyze data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No other anomalies are observable without additional code context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement with no further logic provided. 'import *' can hide dependencies or malicious code embedded in the 'option' module, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine malicious intent. The snippet alone is minimal, limiting the ability to identify suspicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code only contains an import statement that imports all contents from the 'option' module. On its own, it does not exhibit malicious behavior but the use of 'import *' warrants caution, especially if the 'option' module contains malicious or unwanted code. Further code review of the 'option' module is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.",
