  "purpose": "Export the validate_ticket function from the main module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.main'. No input data reading appears in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports and exports a function without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal code snippet that re-exports a function named validate_ticket from a local module. It uses a relative import, which is standard in package structures. The __all__ variable limits what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for module exports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues based on this snippet.",
