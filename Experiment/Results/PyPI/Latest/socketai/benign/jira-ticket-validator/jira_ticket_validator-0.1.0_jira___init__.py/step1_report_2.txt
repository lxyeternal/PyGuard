  "purpose": "Export the validate_ticket function from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.main). No input or data reading from external sources is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there are no data processing or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic; only a simple import and export statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'validate_ticket' from a relative module '.main' and exposes it publicly via __all__. There are no indications of data handling, user input, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module export statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It appears to be a standard, benign code snippet intended for module interface definition.",
