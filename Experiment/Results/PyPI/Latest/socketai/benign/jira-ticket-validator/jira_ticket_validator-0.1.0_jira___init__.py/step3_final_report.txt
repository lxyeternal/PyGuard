{
  "purpose": "This code module imports 'validate_ticket' from a local 'main' module and exposes it via __all__, serving as an interface or wrapper.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import validate_ticket",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a static import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a function and re-exports it. There are no data processing, input/output, or suspicious patterns. The security and maliciousness depend on the implementation of 'validate_ticket' in the 'main' module, which is outside this snippet. The code itself shows no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious or security issues in this snippet. The overall security posture depends on the implementation of 'validate_ticket' in 'main', but this code alone is safe.",
