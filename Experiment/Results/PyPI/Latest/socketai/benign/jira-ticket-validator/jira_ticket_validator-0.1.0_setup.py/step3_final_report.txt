  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setuptools functions, and defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() function, which installs dependencies and registers console scripts.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content -> executing setup() with provided parameters -> registering 'jira-ticket-validator' command.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no embedded or suspicious code. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The reports provided are empty, containing only 'Empty response' messages, which prevents any detailed assessment. Given the lack of detailed findings, the code appears benign, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero. The setup script relies on standard practices, and no suspicious dependencies or code patterns are present. The only potential concern is the reading of 'README.md' without error handling, but this is common and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no detected malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any evidence to challenge this conclusion. Scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
