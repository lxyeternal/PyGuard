  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .fetcher import FetcherImage`.\n   - The code does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform network operations.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the minimal nature of the code and its purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code only performs an import with no other activity, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or malware indicators are present.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that the import statement is safe, which is reasonable.\n   - There are no assumptions about external data, network activity, or code execution beyond the import.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and pose no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk and does not contain obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
