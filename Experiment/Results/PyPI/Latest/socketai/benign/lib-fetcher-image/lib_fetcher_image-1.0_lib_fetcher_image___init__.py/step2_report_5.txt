  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .fetcher import FetcherImage`.\n   - There are no additional code executions, data handling, or network activities in this snippet.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be to expose the `FetcherImage` class for use elsewhere in the package.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Security Concerns**:\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or signs of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or data flows that could be exploited.\n   - Given its minimal and straightforward nature, it does not pose any security risk.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement, increasing the malware score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - While the import itself is benign, one could consider whether the `FetcherImage` class might contain malicious code. However, that is outside the scope of this specific snippet.\n   - If there were concerns about supply chain risks, it would be necessary to review the `fetcher` module itself, but based solely on this code, no issues are present.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis is a minimal, benign import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nNo changes needed. The code is safe as-is.",
