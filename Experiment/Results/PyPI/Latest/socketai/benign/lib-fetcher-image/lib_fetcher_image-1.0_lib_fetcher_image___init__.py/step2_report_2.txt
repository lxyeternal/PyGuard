  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \nAll reports are based on the same minimal code snippet:\n```python\nfrom .fetcher import FetcherImage\n```\nThis is a straightforward import statement, with no additional logic, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external dependencies.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes**:  \nThe reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement. No errors, flaws, or suspicious constructs are present. The reasoning is consistent across all reports.\n\n3. **Score Reasonableness**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or indicators are present.  \n- **Security Risk (0)**: Correct, as the code is benign and does not pose any security threat.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification**:  \nAll scores are appropriately low given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No change is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0, as there's no malicious behavior.  \n- Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:  \nNo vulnerabilities are claimed or implied. The code only performs an import, which is standard practice.\n\n7. **Consistency with Report Content**:  \nAll reports are consistent, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis is a minimal, benign import statement with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security concern in this code snippet.",
