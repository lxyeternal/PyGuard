  "purpose": "Import the FetcherImage class from the fetcher module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local fetcher module",
  "sinks": "None, as the code only imports a class; no data handling or external effects are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as no data flow or execution logic is present beyond import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; simple import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing FetcherImage from a relative module. There are no inputs, no data processing, or side effects. This is a standard module initialization file. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious or malicious intent. The code serves to include a class from another module, typical in Python packages.",
