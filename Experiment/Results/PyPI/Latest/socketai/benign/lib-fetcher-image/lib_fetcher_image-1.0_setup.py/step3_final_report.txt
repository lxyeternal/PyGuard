  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'lib-fetcher-image' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static code with no dynamic input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not execute data flows at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to specify package name, version, dependencies, description, author info, and URL. It contains no dynamic code, no input handling, and dependencies are common for web requests, HTML parsing, user-agent spoofing, and image processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and static, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no changes are necessary.",
