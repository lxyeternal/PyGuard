  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'lib-fetcher-image', specifying its dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, and required dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources or untrusted input; all inputs are hardcoded strings and lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present; the code appears to be a standard setup script with no obfuscated elements or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup and package finding functions from setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. All data is hardcoded and typical for a Python package setup. No external data input or dynamic execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for publishing a Python package.",
