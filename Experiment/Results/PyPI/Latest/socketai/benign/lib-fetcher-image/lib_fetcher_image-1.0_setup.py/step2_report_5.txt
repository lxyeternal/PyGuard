  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll five reports consistently conclude that the provided code is a standard, benign Python setup script for packaging a library named 'lib-fetcher-image'. They emphasize that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The dependencies are common for web scraping and image processing tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a typical setup.py configuration.\n- **Malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious constructs:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **External or untrusted data sources:** None used; the code is static.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None, as the code only declares dependencies and metadata.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are identified, the risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n- No concerns or discrepancies are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- Since all reports are unanimous, there is no need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with static data, no dynamic execution, no suspicious dependencies, and no signs of malicious intent. The consistent analysis across all reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the security posture is sound. No further action or concern is necessary based on the provided data.",
