  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python library 'lib-fetcher-image'.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the package metadata (name, version, author info) and the dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code only declares dependencies and package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup process is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard setup script with typical package information and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script used to package a Python library. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic execution or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies listed are common and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python setup script used for packaging a library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
