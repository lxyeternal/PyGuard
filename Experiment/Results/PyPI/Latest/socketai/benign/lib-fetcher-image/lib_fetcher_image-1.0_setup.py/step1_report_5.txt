  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'lib-fetcher-image' Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information and dependencies specified in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data or inputs; the code solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setuptools syntax and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata such as package name, version, author info, URL, description, and dependencies. All values are hardcoded and static, with no dynamic code execution, user input, or environment variable usage. Dependencies are typical for a package that performs web requests and image processing. No suspicious or malicious code is present; the package appears to be a standard setup script for a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely specifies package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic or data handling.",
