  "purpose": "Define and configure the package 'glair' for distribution, specifying dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata and a list of dependencies. Dependencies are specified with version constraints to ensure environment consistency. No user input, network activity, or code execution beyond package setup occurs. The structure is typical of Python packaging scripts and contains no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
