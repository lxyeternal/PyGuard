{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of the 'glair' Python project, specifying its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard setup patterns and dependencies without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are well-known packages with official version constraints. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The script neither reads untrusted input nor performs any network or file operations beyond standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
