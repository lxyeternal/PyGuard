      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate medical imaging analysis pipeline with no malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to local file handling, which is benign. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the benign nature of local file outputs."
