  "purpose": "Import the function 'vae_predict' from the local module 'main' to be used in the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it only imports a function.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'vae_predict' into the namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of 'vae_predict' from 'main'. No data processing, network activity, or execution occurs here. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The import is typical in modular Python projects and does not pose any security threat on its own. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the benign and safe nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
