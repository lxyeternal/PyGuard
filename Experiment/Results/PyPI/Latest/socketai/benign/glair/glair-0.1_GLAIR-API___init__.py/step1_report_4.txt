{
  "purpose": "Import the function 'vae_predict' from a module named 'main' within the same package",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'main' and the 'vae_predict' function within it",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this single import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing is evident in this single line of code",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python packages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this snippet. Since it is only an import statement, it cannot be used alone to perform malicious actions. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or backdoors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal component of a larger codebase.",
