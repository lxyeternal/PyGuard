{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'vae_predict' from a local module 'main', likely for performing Variational Autoencoder predictions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, which does not involve external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs an import operation without data flow or execution flow beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This is a single import statement importing 'vae_predict' from a relative module 'main'. It does not contain data processing, user input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase and on its own poses no security risk.",
