{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'vae_predict' function from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely for performing variational autoencoder predictions.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data reading is shown in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet; the code only shows an import statement.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing is demonstrated in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing a function called 'vae_predict' from a local module 'main'. It does not contain executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase where 'vae_predict' is used later on.",
