  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'vae_predict' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'main' via the import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions beyond import.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; it's a straightforward import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional logic or data handling. No anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing 'vae_predict' from a local module 'main'. There is no indication of data input, processing, or output. Since it's a simple import, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation evident. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could be harmful or malicious.",
