{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple entry point that imports and runs the 'main' function from the 'piepal' package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from the 'piepal' package; no other sources of input are present.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function from 'piepal' is called; potential sinks depend on its implementation, but this code itself does not contain direct sinks.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible within this script; the flow depends on 'piepal.main()' execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It imports a package and runs its main function.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimalistic entry point script that imports and executes 'main' from 'piepal'. Without the implementation details of 'piepal.main()', no malicious behavior can be inferred from this script alone. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself appears benign and serves as a simple launcher for 'piepal'. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident within this code snippet.",
