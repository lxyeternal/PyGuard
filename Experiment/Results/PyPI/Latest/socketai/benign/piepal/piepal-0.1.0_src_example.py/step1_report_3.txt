{
  "purpose": "The script imports and executes the main function from the 'piepal' library, likely serving as an entry point for an application or tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'piepal'; invocation of main() function",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function, which could potentially contain untrusted data handling depending on 'piepal' implementation",
  "flows": "Import from 'piepal' -> call to main()",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script that executes the main function from the 'piepal' library. Since it only imports and calls a single function without additional logic, the security posture largely depends on the contents of 'piepal'. There are no obvious malicious behaviors, no suspicious data handling or malicious payloads in this snippet. The code itself appears benign but offers no insight into what 'main()' does internally.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself is minimal and appears benign; however, its security depends on the implementation of 'piepal.main'. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident within this small code snippet.",
