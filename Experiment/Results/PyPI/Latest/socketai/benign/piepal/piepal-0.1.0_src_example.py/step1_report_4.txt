  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the piepal library, likely to run its primary functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from piepal library, which is a third-party dependency.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function from piepal; no direct data sinks present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Import of piepal -> calling piepal.main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; minimal code structure, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'piepal' library and immediately calls its main() function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or insecure operations within this snippet. Since 'piepal' is a third-party dependency, its internal behavior determines overall security, but nothing suspicious is evident in this code snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script that runs the main() function of the 'piepal' library. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks within this minimal code fragment.",
