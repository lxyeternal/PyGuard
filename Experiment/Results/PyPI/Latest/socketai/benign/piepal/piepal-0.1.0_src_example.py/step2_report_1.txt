  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and primarily serves as an entry point to invoke `piepal.main()`.\n- None of the reports identify any suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code within this snippet.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the `piepal` package itself, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The malware scores are all zero, reflecting no malicious activity detected directly in this script.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and reliance on external package trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is simple and does not contain issues.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None identified.\n- **Scores assigned:** Generally reasonable; no need for adjustments based on the code snippet alone.\n- **Malware justification:** Zero scores are justified; no malicious activity is apparent.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly note that security depends on `piepal`'s implementation, not this script.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, minimal, and relies on the external package.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting minimal direct risk from this script.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and reports, **the actual risk is minimal**. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of `piepal`, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal baseline risk due to dependency on external code)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code appears benign; the overall security posture depends on the external package.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.",
