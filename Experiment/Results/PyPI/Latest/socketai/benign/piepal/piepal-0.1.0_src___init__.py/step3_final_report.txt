{
  "purpose": "Import a 'main' function from a local module 'piepal', likely as part of a larger application or entry point script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only contains an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code, no network activity, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'main' from 'piepal' but does not invoke it; thus, no data or control flow occurs beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple shebang line followed by a relative import of 'main' from 'piepal'. It does not execute any code or handle data, making it benign. The absence of active logic, network activity, or data handling indicates no malicious intent. The use of relative import is typical in modular Python projects but not suspicious. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with a slight caution reflected in a risk score of 0.1 due to external dependency considerations. Overall, the code is a benign component of a larger system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its minimal and safe nature.",
