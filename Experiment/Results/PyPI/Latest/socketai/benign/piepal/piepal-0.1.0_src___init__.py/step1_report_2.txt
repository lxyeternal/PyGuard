{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a script that imports the 'main' function from a module named 'piepal' and is likely intended to execute the main functionality of that module.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module named 'piepal' and possibly reads the 'main' function from it.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'piepal' module -> execution of 'main' function (assumed to be called later in the code, not shown here).",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no visible anomalies. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python entry point with a relative import of 'main' from 'piepal'. The code does not show execution of 'main' or any other logic, limiting assessment. The import suggests reliance on the 'piepal' package, which is not provided, but this alone is not suspicious. The code structure is typical for a Python module intended to be run as a script. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a simple and benign entry point script that imports and presumably runs the 'main' function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
