{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal script intended to invoke the main function from a module named 'piepal'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .piepal import main' which loads the main function from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transmitted within this snippet",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from 'piepal' as a source, but no further data flow or execution shown",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, but the use of a relative import without context may indicate modular design; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors evident",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point that imports a main function from a local module 'piepal'. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic present. The minimal structure provides no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code's security implications depend on the content of 'piepal', which is not provided here. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for Python projects using relative imports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a straightforward entry point importing a main function. Without additional context or content from 'piepal', this appears safe.",
