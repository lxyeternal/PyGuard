{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports and possibly executes the 'main' function from the 'piepal' package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module or package 'piepal'. No external input or data sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this snippet; it only imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with a relative import, which is unusual in scripts intended to be executed directly, but not inherently malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'main' from a local module 'piepal'. There is no additional logic, input handling, or output present. Without further context, this code solely facilitates access to 'main' from 'piepal'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or code execution beyond the import.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward import statement, potentially part of a larger project. The absence of active code or data flow limits the analysis.",
