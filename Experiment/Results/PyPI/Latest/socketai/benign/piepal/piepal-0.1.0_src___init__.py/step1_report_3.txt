  "purpose": "Entry point script that imports and runs the main function from the piepal module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .piepal imports code from a local module named piepal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call main function from piepal",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a typical script entry point. No anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses a standard shebang for Python 3 and imports a main function from a local module. It does not contain any execution logic beyond the import, which is typical for a command-line entry point. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are visible. The code is too minimal to contain obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward script that serves as an entry point for a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
