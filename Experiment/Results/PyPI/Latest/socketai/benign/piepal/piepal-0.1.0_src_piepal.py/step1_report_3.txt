{
  "purpose": "The script interacts with the PayPal API to fetch subscription, transaction, and plan data, and displays reports using rich formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API credentials, user input via command-line arguments, and fetches data via HTTP requests using the requests library.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests with sensitive credentials, outputs data to the console, and logs verbose information; no data is written to external servers or files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables for credentials -> API requests (using requests.post/get) -> Data parsing -> Display functions -> Optional verbose logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Usage of environment variables is standard. The code does not perform any unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. All API interactions appear typical.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves credentials securely from environment variables, performs standard API requests to PayPal endpoints, and displays data using the rich library. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network communications. Verbose logging is conditional, and no suspicious file or network activity is detected. The command-line interface offers data retrieval functionalities in a controlled manner. Overall, the code functions as a legitimate API viewer with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard tool for viewing PayPal subscription and transaction data, with no indicators of malicious behavior. It handles sensitive data appropriately, performs legitimate API calls, and outputs information securely. No malware or security risks are detected.",
