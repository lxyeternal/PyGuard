{
  "purpose": "The code is a command-line tool for interacting with the PayPal API to retrieve and display subscription, transaction, and plan data, primarily for monitoring or auditing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API credentials (dotenv), reads user input via command-line arguments, fetches data from PayPal API endpoints using HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external PayPal API endpoints, retrieves data which is then displayed on the console, and loads sensitive credentials from environment variables.",
  "flows": "Loads credentials from environment variables -> Uses credentials for API authentication in HTTP requests -> Retrieves data from PayPal API -> Processes and displays data on the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. Use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard but should be handled securely; no hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches API credentials from environment variables, then performs authenticated requests to PayPal endpoints to retrieve subscription and transaction data. It provides various display functions for user-friendly output. No code patterns indicative of malicious activity, such as data theft, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors, are present. All external calls are legitimate API requests, and there are no suspicious dynamic code executions or obfuscations. The code relies on standard libraries and good practices for handling credentials. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or malware signs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring utility for PayPal API data, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely retrieves and displays sensitive API data without engaging in suspicious actions.",
