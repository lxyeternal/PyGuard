{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a command-line utility to interact with PayPal's API, retrieving and displaying subscription, transaction, and plan data for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables (dotenv), command-line arguments, and API responses from PayPal endpoints.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console using the rich library; no data is sent over the network or written to files beyond API requests.",
  "flows": "Credentials are loaded from environment variables; API requests are made over HTTPS; responses are processed and displayed; no untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious patterns detected. Minor bug: 'plan_data' used uninitialized in main(), but unrelated to security.",
  "analysis": "The script securely manages credentials via environment variables, performs standard API requests over HTTPS, and displays data without suspicious modifications. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low risk score is justified by proper credential handling and benign purpose. The malware score is zero, as no malicious payloads or behaviors are observed. The obfuscation score is zero, given the straightforward code structure. The only concern is the minor bug with 'plan_data', which does not impact security but should be fixed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for monitoring PayPal subscriptions and transactions. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
