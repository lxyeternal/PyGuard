{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to package a library, primarily serving as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; static metadata fields such as name, version, author, classifiers, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment flows from code to setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and conventional for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, calls setup() with static metadata, reads a local README.md file without context managers, and performs no dynamic or malicious operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the purpose aligns with a placeholder package to prevent dependency confusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
