  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration using setuptools, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, description, long description from README.md, and uses find_packages() to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems, no user input handling, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools. It configures package metadata including name, version, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement. It reads the long description from a local README.md file, which is standard practice. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code does not contain any suspicious logic or potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not include any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The package appears to be a placeholder designed to mitigate dependency confusion risks, with no indications of malware or security issues.",
