{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration using setuptools, primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content into 'long_description' without any further processing or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read a local file for 'long_description' without validation or sanitization; no other suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging. It imports 'setuptools' functions, defines package metadata, reads a README file for the description, and specifies classifiers and requirements. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data manipulation is present. The file appears to serve solely as a package configuration without malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads a local file for documentation purposes only, with no evident vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.",
