  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library, primarily to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content into the long_description field during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup code. The description states it's a placeholder package to mitigate dependency confusion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. It reads 'README.md' to populate the long_description. No input from external sources at runtime beyond static file reading; no dynamic code execution, no environment variable usage, no network activity, or embedded secrets. The code appears to be a benign package configuration script with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to package a Python project with placeholder information. The code is straightforward and safe.",
