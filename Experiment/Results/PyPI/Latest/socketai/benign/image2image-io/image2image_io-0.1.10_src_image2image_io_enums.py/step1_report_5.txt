{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, constants, and data type mappings for use in a larger application, likely related to image processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Constants and enum definitions; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only contains static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum declarations, constant definitions, and a dictionary mapping. It uses standard Python features and well-known libraries (enum, typing, numpy). There are no indications of malicious intent, no data leaks, and no insecure practices. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a set of definitions for use in a larger system. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
