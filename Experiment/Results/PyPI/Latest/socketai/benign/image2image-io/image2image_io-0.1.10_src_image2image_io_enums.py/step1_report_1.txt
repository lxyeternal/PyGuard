{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, type aliases, constants, and a dictionary for data type mappings related to image processing or data visualization.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read; all data is statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or output to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. The numpy dtype mapping is extensive but static and does not execute any malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines constants, enums, and a dictionary. There are no functions, user inputs, or dynamic execution. The mapping dictionary for numpy dtypes is static, with no indications of malicious intent. No secrets, credentials, or network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definitions module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines data structures and constants, with no external or sensitive interactions.",
