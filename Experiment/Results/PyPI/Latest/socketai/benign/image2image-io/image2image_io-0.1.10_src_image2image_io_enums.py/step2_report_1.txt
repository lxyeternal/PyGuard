  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code defines enums, constants, and a dtype mapping. All data is static, with no external input or dynamic execution.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are correctly identified as zero.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign and purely declarative is accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with no external data or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly identified as zero.  \n- **Verdict:** The code is a standard definitions module; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, a static set of definitions with no external input or dynamic code.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Static definitions, no data flow or external input.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly zero.  \n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—definitions only, no dynamic or external data.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero.  \n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or obfuscated code.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None apparent. The logic is sound, and the conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n- **Scores:** All malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward set of definitions—enums, constants, and a dtype mapping—used for internal configuration or data handling.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n- The data is static, with no external input, output, or dynamic execution.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's content. No adjustments needed.",
