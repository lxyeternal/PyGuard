  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines enums, constants, and a dtype mapping.\n- Findings: No external input, no dynamic code, static definitions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: The code is purely declarative with no signs of malicious behavior. The numpy dtype mapping is static and straightforward.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining enums and constants.\n- Findings: No external data, no dynamic behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: Again, static definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines enums, constants, and dtype mappings.\n- Findings: Static, no external input or output, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No suspicious activity; code is a configuration module.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar definitions for image processing.\n- Findings: No external data, static definitions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: Static, no external data or dynamic code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Justification: Clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. All reports confirm that the code is purely declarative, defining enums, constants, and mappings.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden behaviors:** None observed.\n- **External interactions:** No file I/O, network, or user input.\n- **Sensitive data or secrets:** Not present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code is static and safe; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code poses no security risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a straightforward, static definitions module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
