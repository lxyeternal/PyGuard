  "purpose": "Define enums, constants, and type aliases for a larger image processing or visualization project.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constant definitions, class and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data and types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, and no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines enums and constants relevant to image data processing. No external data is read, and no data is sent or processed dynamically. The enum class and dictionaries are static definitions. The numpy dtype mapping appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration and type definition module without any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security issues.",
