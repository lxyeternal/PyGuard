  "purpose": "Defines enums, constants, and type annotations for a larger Python project related to image processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "No user input, external data sources, or untrusted data reads; only constants, type annotations, and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no file writes, network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; code only defines data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The numpy dtype mapping appears comprehensive and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines constants, and creates an enum. There are no functions, no data processing, or external interactions. The enum and dictionaries are for configuration or internal use. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of definitions for an application, with no malicious or security risk indications. It appears safe, with no evident vulnerabilities or malware.",
