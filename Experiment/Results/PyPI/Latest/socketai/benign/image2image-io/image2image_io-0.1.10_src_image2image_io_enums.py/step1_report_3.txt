{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, constants, and type aliases for use in a larger project, primarily for data representation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, definitions of constants, and enum class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted input; code mostly defines data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks observed; primarily static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains type definitions, enum classes, and a dictionary mapping numerical codes to numpy data types. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, or other suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve as part of a larger codebase to standardize data types and constants. It is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard component defining enums and constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
