{
  "purpose": "Defines enums, constants, and a numpy dtype mapping for internal configuration and data handling in image processing or visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Static definitions, constants, and mappings initialized at module load time; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate keys in the SITK_TO_NP_DTYPE dictionary (e.g., key 12 and 13 both map to np.uint8 and np.int8 respectively, and similarly for other keys), which could cause confusion or runtime issues but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining enums, constants, and a dtype mapping. It contains no external data handling, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The numpy dtype mapping is static, with some duplicate keys which are likely typos but do not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to zero. The code poses no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The static nature and use of standard libraries further confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static definitions module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
