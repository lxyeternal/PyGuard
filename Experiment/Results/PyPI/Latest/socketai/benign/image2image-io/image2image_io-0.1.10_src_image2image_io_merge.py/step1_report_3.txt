  "purpose": "Merge multiple images from given paths into a single output image file.",
  "sources": "Reads input image file paths from the 'paths' parameter; uses get_simple_reader() to read image metadata.",
  "sinks": "Writes the merged image to the specified output directory using merge_write_image_by_plane.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> get_simple_reader() -> reads metadata; MergeImages object -> MergeOmeTiffWriter -> writes merged image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No code injection or obfuscated code detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a function to merge images. It loads image metadata securely, then writes merged images to disk. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; all operations relate to image processing and logging. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, or unsafe code practices are present. The code relies on established libraries and safe filesystem operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image merging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates securely within the scope of image file handling and logging.",
