  "purpose": "Merge multiple image files into a single image with specified format and options.",
  "sources": "Input paths list, output_dir, and other parameters provided to the merge function; get_simple_reader() reads image data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected; no untrusted data outputs or external data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Paths are converted to Path objects (source), data is read using get_simple_reader() (source), and the merged image is written using merge_write_image_by_plane() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code structures observed. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs image file merging utilizing external libraries. It reads image data, logs process durations, and writes output images. All operations appear to be standard for image processing tasks. No indications of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. External dependencies are used normally, and no unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical image merging utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions within expected parameters for a safe image processing script.",
