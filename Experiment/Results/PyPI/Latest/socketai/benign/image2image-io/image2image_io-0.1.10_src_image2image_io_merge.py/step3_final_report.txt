  "purpose": "Merge multiple images into a single output file in OME-TIFF format using external image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading image files via get_simple_reader, obtaining metadata such as resolution, channel names, and image shape.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted data sinks; it writes merged images to disk. No network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input image paths -> read metadata and images -> merge images with MergeImages -> write merged image with merge_write_image_by_plane -> output file.",
  "anomalies": "The function returns 'path', which is set in the last iteration of the loop over input paths; likely intended to return 'output_path'. This appears to be a bug, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image merging operations using external libraries. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The only issue is the return statement returning 'path' instead of 'output_path', which is a minor bug affecting correctness but not security. External dependencies are common and used safely. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image merging utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only concern is a minor bug in the return value, which should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security.",
