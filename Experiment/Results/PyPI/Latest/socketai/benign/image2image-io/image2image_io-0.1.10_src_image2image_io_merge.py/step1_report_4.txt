{
  "purpose": "Merge multiple images into a single output file, specifically in OME-TIFF format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'paths', 'output_dir', 'name', 'fmt', 'as_uint8', 'channel_ids', 'overwrite'; also external functions get_simple_reader and merge_write_image_by_plane.",
  "sinks": "Output file path constructed as 'output_dir / f\"{name}_merged-registered\"'; the 'merge_write_image_by_plane' function writes to this output path.",
  "flows": "Code reads image data using 'get_simple_reader' (source), processes and merges images, then writes the output via 'merge_write_image_by_plane' (sink), with path and filename controlled by input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code patterns; no unusual or hidden network activity. Import statements are straightforward. No indication of malicious behavior in the logic.",
  "analysis": "The code loads images from specified paths using a safe external library, merges these images with a defined process, and writes the result to a specified directory. All input data is controlled via parameters, and the external libraries appear standard for image processing. No indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. It operates as a typical image merging utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs image merging functionality using standard libraries and external modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The logic appears benign and intended solely for image processing tasks.",
