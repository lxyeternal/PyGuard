  "purpose": "This code defines version metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, with static version strings and type checking constructs.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static data initialization",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version information module with no external input, dynamic behavior, or network activity. It uses standard practices for type checking and version assignment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is generated by a trusted tool (setuptools-scm) and serves purely as metadata. All signals indicate benign, straightforward code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
