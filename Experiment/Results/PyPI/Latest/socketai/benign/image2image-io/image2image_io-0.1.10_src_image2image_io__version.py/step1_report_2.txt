  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, to facilitate version management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings assigned to __version__, version, __version__tuple__, and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs; only internal variable assignments.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING block for type annotations, but no suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version metadata module, with conditional type hints and static version variables. No external input handling or network activity. No obfuscated code, no code injection, or malicious behaviors. The presence of version info is standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version info module generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
