  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version information, with hardcoded version strings ('0.1.10') and version tuple. It includes conditional type annotations for type checking. The code does not perform any data processing, input/output, network activity, or execute dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm for version management, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet, safe and free from malicious behavior. It does not introduce security risks or suspicious activities.",
