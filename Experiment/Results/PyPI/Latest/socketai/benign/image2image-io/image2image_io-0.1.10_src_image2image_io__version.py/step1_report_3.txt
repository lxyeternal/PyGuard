  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static variable definitions, version string and tuple assignments, and conditional type checking imports. There are no external input sources, no data processing, or network activities. The code explicitly states it is generated by setuptools-scm and emphasizes not to change or track in version control. All data assignments are hardcoded, with no evidence of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. The structure is straightforward and typical for version declaration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a version info module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It is standard version declaration code generated by a build tool.",
