  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static version declaration generated by setuptools-scm.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely metadata, with standard use of conditional type checking.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- The code matches the original code exactly; no anomalies, hidden behavior, or malicious code are present.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and static assignment is standard practice.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty in the assessment.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Malware: 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- No changes are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, which is a standard and trusted tool, the risk remains minimal.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard for version management.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0**      |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security vulnerabilities. The high confidence from the reports aligns with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThere are no indications of malicious intent or security issues in this code snippet. The assessment aligns with the consensus of the reports.",
