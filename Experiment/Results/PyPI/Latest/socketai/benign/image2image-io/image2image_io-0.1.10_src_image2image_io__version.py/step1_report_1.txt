{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm for version management.",
  "sources": "Variables __version__, __version_tuple__, version, version_tuple initialized with static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version data; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and conditional typing is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily metadata, establishing version variables with static strings and tuples. It contains standard type checking constructs. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. The initial comments indicate it is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, which is common for version management. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and the structure is simple and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a version info placeholder with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified. It is safe and typical for package version definitions.",
