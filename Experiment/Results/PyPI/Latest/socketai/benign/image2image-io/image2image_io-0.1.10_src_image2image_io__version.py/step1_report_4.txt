  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, imports under TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs; only variable assignments and type checking.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment of version data to module variables, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information variables for a package, with conditional typing imports. All operations are straightforward assignments of static version data. There are no external data inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious constructs or obfuscation. The code is standard for package versioning and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package versioning module generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
