{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for test data management, polygon mask creation, and temporary directory handling.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system for test data files, accessing environment variables (tempdir), importing third-party libraries (numpy, tifffile, skimage), and handling directory cleanup.",
  "sinks": "Writing TIFF files, creating and deleting temporary directories and files, removing files/directories during cleanup.",
  "flows": "get_test_files / get_test_file/read/write test data files / create TIFF images / cleanup directories and files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. Directory cleanup uses recursion with exception handling but no suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling test data files and creating test images using numpy and tifffile. Directory cleanup involves recursive deletion with exception suppression, which is standard for safe cleanup routines. No network, system modification, or suspicious behavior is present. The code relies on environment variables indirectly via tempdir but does not misuse or leak data. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be safe utility code used for testing and temporary file management. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It performs standard filesystem operations with proper handling.",
