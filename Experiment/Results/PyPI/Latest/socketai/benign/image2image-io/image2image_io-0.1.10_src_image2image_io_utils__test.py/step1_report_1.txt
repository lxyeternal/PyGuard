  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, test data creation, and temporary directory management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files from a predefined directory, reads and writes image files (TIFF), and reads system temporary directory paths.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (creating directories, writing image files, deleting directories), glob patterns for file matching, and os.remove calls.",
  "flows": "File paths are constructed from the TEST_DATA_DIR or output_dir; image data is generated and written to files; cleanup_directory deletes directories and files using shutil.rmtree and os.remove.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of 'tempdir' from tempfile is standard; directory cleanup functions are typical but could be misused if called maliciously (but this is not inherently malicious). The code does not contain obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling test data files and creating sample image data, with directory cleanup features. It performs standard file I/O operations and directory management, with no indications of malicious behavior. The cleanup_directory function safely deletes files and directories, handling exceptions gracefully. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior present. All modules used are standard or well-known third-party libraries, and no unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for testing purposes and directory cleanup, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues.",
