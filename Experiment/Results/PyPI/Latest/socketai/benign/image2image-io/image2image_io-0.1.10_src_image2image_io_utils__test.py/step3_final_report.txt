  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling test data files, creating test images, and managing temporary directories, including cleanup routines.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations such as reading test data directory, opening specific files, and directory cleanup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; filesystem operations are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Functions read from filesystem (sources), perform directory cleanup or file creation (sinks), with no untrusted data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import inside functions (e.g., in make_test_polygon and cleanup_directory) is unusual but not malicious; recursive directory deletion with exception handling is standard but could be risky if misused outside controlled context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for file handling, test data creation, and directory cleanup. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. Directory cleanup uses recursive deletion with exception suppression, which is typical in testing utilities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for testing and directory management, with no malicious or security issues detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
