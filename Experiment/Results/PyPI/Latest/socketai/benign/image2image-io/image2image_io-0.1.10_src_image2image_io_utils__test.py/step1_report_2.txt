{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, test data creation, and directory cleanup, mainly used in testing and temporary data management.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script file path (__file__), glob pattern for test files, input filename for test files, output directory for test data creation, and paths for temporary directories.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as directory creation, file writing (tiff images), and directory removal (shutil.rmtree, os.remove). No untrusted data used for critical operations or network activity.",
  "flows": "Path and filename inputs are used to access and create files, then data is written or directories are cleaned up. No external network or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import inside a function (`make_test_polygon` and `cleanup_directory`) is unusual but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. Directory cleanup uses recursive removal, which is standard but can be dangerous if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for managing test data and temporary directories, with safe filesystem operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. Directory cleanup is robust and cautious, with exception handling and suppression of permission errors. No signs of malicious intent or malware found.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides utility functions for testing purposes and safe directory management without any malicious behavior. It does not contain any malware or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and aligned with typical testing and cleanup routines.",
