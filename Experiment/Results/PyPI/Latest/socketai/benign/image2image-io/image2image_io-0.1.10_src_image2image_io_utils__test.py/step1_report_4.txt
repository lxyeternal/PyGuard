  "purpose": "Utility functions for test data management, file handling, and temporary directory cleanup in a testing environment.",
  "sources": "File system access (Path, glob, os, shutil), import statements, user-defined functions accessing file paths, external libraries (numpy, tifffile, skimage).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (shutil.rmtree, os.remove), file writes (tifffile.imwrite).",
  "flows": "File and directory path construction from __file__ and user input, cleanup functions delete files and directories recursively, test data creation writes image files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity. The cleanup_directory function uses recursive deletion, which could be dangerous if misused, but is standard for cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling test files, generating sample images, and cleaning directories. No untrusted input processing or insecure practices are evident. The cleanup_directory function handles directory deletion carefully with exception suppression, but relies on correct path inputs. External libraries are used safely for image processing and file I/O. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage are observed. The code appears to be standard utility code with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for test data handling and cleanup. No malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The use of external libraries and file operations is normal and safe within this context.",
