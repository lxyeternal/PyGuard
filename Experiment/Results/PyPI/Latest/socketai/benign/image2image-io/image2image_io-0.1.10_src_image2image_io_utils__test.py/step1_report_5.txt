  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, test data creation, and directory cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ for TEST_DATA_DIR, glob for file listing, Path for file paths, external libraries (numpy, tifffile, skimage) for image processing, and os/glob for directory cleanup.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious effects directly; directory cleanup uses shutil.rmtree which is standard.",
  "flows": "Paths are constructed from the script location, and data is read from files and written to image files; no untrusted input is processed into dangerous system commands or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling test files, creating synthetic polygon masks saved as TIFF images, and managing temporary directories with setup and cleanup routines. The get_test_files and get_test_file functions rely on the filesystem and do basic existence checks. make_test_polygon creates image files using numpy, tifffile, and skimage, which is typical for testing purposes. The CleanupMixin class manages temporary directories with properties and methods that initialize and delete directories, using standard shutil and glob operations. The cleanup_directory function recursively deletes directories, with exception suppression to handle permission issues, which is safe in context. No external data input, network operations, or system commands are invoked that could be malicious. The code is clean, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility and testing-related, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard libraries and safe practices. No malicious intent or dangerous vulnerabilities are detected.",
