  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling in CZI file processing.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no input or processing operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError, used for specific error identification related to CZI files. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or malicious constructs present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The classes are straightforward, minimal, and serve as error indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or security anomalies.",
