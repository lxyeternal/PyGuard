  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to multi-scene CZI files and unsupported file formats.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from ValueError, with descriptive docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; purely class definitions with no external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are static definitions used for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with only class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from ValueError, serving as custom exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for error handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and harmlessness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as standard custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or concern is necessary.",
