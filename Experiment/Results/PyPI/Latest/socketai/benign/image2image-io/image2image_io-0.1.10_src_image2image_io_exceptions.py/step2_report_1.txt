  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code contains only two class definitions inheriting from `ValueError`. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for defining custom exceptions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly note the absence of input/output operations, data handling, or any suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated score of 0, malware score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and harmlessness of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the evidence, I would assign the following estimated scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n  - **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, serves a typical purpose in error handling, and shows no signs of malicious or obfuscated content. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
