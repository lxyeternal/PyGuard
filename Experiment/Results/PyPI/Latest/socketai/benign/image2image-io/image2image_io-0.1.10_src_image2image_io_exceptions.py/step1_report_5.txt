  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple class definitions with no executable code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError, with docstrings describing their purpose. There are no functions, data inputs, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
