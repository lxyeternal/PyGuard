  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error types related to CZI files.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there are only class definitions without methods or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from ValueError. These classes serve to categorize specific errors but do not perform any operations, data handling, or security-sensitive tasks. There are no inputs, outputs, or potentially malicious behaviors present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
