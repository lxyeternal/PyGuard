  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling specific CZI file errors.",
  "sources": "No input data reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions with no active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no indications of malicious behavior. The classes are straightforward and serve as error types, which is common in Python for error handling. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, harmless class definitions for specific error handling. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
