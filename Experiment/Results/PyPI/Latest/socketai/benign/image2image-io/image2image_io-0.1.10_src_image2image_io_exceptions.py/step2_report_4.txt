  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the actual code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is simply defining two custom exception classes inheriting from `ValueError`. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or malicious behaviors.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains only class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - No report seems to overstate or understate the security implications. They all agree that this code is harmless.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence, which is appropriate)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and harmless nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is merely defining exception classes, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The malware score is also 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on what the code actually does.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as error classification, with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is standard Python exception class definitions, typical in many projects for error handling.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and correctly scored. No further action or concern is warranted.",
