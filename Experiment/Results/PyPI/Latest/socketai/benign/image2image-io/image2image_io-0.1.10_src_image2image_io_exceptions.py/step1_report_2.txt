  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error types related to CZI files.",
  "sources": "Class definitions do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes serve as error indicators for specific issues but do not perform any operations or contain suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error classification with no malicious intent or security risks.",
