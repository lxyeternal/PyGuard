  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code behavior, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code retrieves the version of the package \"image2image-io\" via `importlib.metadata.version`.\n- If the package isn't installed, it sets `__version__` to \"uninstalled\".\n- It also defines static metadata: `__author__` and `__email__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, no data flows to external systems, and no suspicious operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code functions as intended, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. It performs a standard package version retrieval with exception handling.  \n  **No issues are present in the code.**\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:**  \n  The code is static, simple, and uses standard library functions. No network activity, no code execution, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscation are present.  \n  **Malware score: 0**  \n  **Obfuscated score: 0**  \n  **Security risk: 0**\n\n- **Logic errors or reasoning flaws:**  \n  The logic is sound, and the exception handling is appropriate for the context.  \n  **No errors or flaws are detected.**\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Evaluation:\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware = 0** — Correct.\n  - **obfuscated = 0** — Correct.\n  - **securityRisk = 0** — Correct.\n  - **confidence = 1** — Justified, as the analysis confirms benign behavior.\n\n- **Potential deviations:**\n  - No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent.\n  - The code is a typical pattern for package version detection.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n| Score Type     | Reasoning                                              |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**   | 0 — No malicious activity or code present.           |\n| **Obfuscated**| 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation. |\n| **Risk**      | 0 — No security risk, no external data, no vulnerabilities. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a simple, standard package metadata retrieval snippet with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; all scores are appropriate given the code.",
