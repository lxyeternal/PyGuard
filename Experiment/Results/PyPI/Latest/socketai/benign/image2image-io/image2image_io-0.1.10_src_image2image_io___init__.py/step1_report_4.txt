  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'image2image-io' package and define author metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function call, exception handling for PackageNotFoundError",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or external data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "Simple version retrieval; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports version retrieval from importlib.metadata, attempts to get the package version, and defaults to 'uninstalled' if not found. Metadata attributes for author and email are set statically. No suspicious, malicious, or malicious-looking code patterns are present. The code functions solely to report package info and author metadata, with no external data transmission or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard package version retrieval and metadata assignment without any malicious intent or security risks.",
