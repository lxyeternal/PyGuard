{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve and set the version of the 'image2image-io' package and defines author metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version and the author metadata from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The source retrieves package version information; no data flows to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of standard library functions and static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, using importlib.metadata to get package version info with exception handling. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The author and email are static strings, and version retrieval is a standard practice. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing simple package metadata retrieval and defining author info with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
