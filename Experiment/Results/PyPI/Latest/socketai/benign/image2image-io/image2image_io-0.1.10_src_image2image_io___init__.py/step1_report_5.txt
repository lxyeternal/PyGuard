{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the version information of the 'image2image-io' package and set author metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version and the package name as a string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The source (version retrieval) flows to setting the __version__ variable, with fallback to 'uninstalled'. No external data is processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the version of a specific package. If the package is not installed, it defaults to 'uninstalled'. The only data read is the package name string, which is static. No user input, network access, or external data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. Metadata like author and email are hardcoded but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package version checker with metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
