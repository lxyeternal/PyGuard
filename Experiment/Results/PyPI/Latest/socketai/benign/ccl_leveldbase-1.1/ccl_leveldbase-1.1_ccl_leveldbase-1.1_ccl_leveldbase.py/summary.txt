  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured parser for LevelDB/LSM-tree files. It operates solely on file I/O and in-memory processing without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero."
