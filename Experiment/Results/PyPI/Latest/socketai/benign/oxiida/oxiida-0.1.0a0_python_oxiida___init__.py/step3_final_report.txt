  "purpose": "Module re-exports functionality from the local 'oxiida' module, exposing only 'run'.",
  "sources": "Relative import of all symbols from '.oxiida'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of all symbols from '.oxiida' (source) to the module namespace (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols; no explicit anomalies in code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative wildcard import from '.oxiida' and defines '__all__' to expose only 'run'. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident in this minimal snippet. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not a security issue. The actual security risk depends on the contents of 'oxiida', which is not provided. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the import style. The code is straightforward and benign, with the main concern being maintainability and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if 'oxiida' is compromised. Scores are appropriately low, and further review of 'oxiida' is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
