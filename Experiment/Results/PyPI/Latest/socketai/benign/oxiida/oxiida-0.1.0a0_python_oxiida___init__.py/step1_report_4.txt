  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import and export statement, likely part of a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package (.oxiida import *)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*) from a local module, which can hide dependencies or malicious code in the imported module; no other suspicious or unusual code features observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'oxiida' and exposes a single 'run' function for external use. The wildcard import can be risky if the imported module contains malicious or unintended code, but by itself, this line is not malicious. The presence of the import and the explicit export of 'run' suggest a simple interface, but it does not provide insight into the contents of 'oxiida'. Without examining 'oxiida', it's impossible to determine if malicious code is included there. The code is minimal and structurally straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a simple import/export wrapper with no direct malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import warrants caution, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. Additional inspection of the 'oxiida' module is recommended to fully assess security risk.",
