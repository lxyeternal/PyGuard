  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if 'oxiida' is compromised. Scores are appropriately low, and further review of 'oxiida' is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."
