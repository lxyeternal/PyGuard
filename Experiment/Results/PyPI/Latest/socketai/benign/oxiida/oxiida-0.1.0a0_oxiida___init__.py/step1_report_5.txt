{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import all contents from a local module named 'oxiida' and explicitly declare 'run' as an exported symbol.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'oxiida'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause side effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') which can obscure which specific symbols are imported, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'oxiida', which could potentially conceal malicious imports if the module is malicious. The '__all__' declaration explicitly exports only the 'run' symbol, limiting exposure. No code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are visible. The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import/export pattern with no immediate signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and export operation with no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import could be a code quality concern but is not inherently malicious. No malware signals are detected.",
