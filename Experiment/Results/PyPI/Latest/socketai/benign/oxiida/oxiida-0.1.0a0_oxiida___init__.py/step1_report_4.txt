{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to re-export all public attributes from the 'oxiida' module, and explicitly expose the 'run' function for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.oxiida' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely an import and export statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') from a local module, which can be risky as it imports all attributes, including potentially malicious or unintended ones; the comment disables linting for this behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'oxiida' module, which could include sensitive or malicious code if the module is compromised or intentionally malicious. The use of 'import *' makes it difficult to determine which specific attributes are imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or data. The code also explicitly defines '__all__' to only expose 'run', indicating an intention to limit external access, but this does not mitigate risks from the import statement itself. There are no other operations, data handling, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal module re-export statement that imports everything from a local module 'oxiida' and exposes only 'run'. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious functions or code. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this code fragment itself. The risk depends heavily on the content of the 'oxiida' module.",
