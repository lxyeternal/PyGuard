  "purpose": "Minimal code importing all symbols from a local module 'oxiida' and exposing only 'run' via __all__.",
  "sources": "Relative import from '.oxiida' module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide malicious or unintended symbols; reliance on an unknown module 'oxiida'",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all symbols from a local module, then exposes 'run' via __all__. No runtime logic, data flows, or external communications are present. The primary concern is that 'import *' can conceal malicious functions if 'oxiida' is compromised or malicious. The module's contents are unknown, so potential malicious behavior depends entirely on that module. The code itself is benign, but the obscurity introduces a risk if 'oxiida' contains malicious code. Scores are assigned accordingly, with malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and a low security risk of 0.2 reflecting the uncertainty about 'oxiida'. Confidence is moderate (0.5–0.8) due to the lack of further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'oxiida' module, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero, and a slight risk score to account for potential hidden malicious code within 'oxiida'.",
