  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code imports from 'oxiida' and exposes 'run'.\n- No sinks or data flows, only import and export.\n- Highlights that 'import *' can hide malicious code, but the module content is unknown.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code itself is benign but depends on the 'oxiida' module. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate given no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is low, mainly due to obscurity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose, emphasizes that no suspicious patterns are present.\n- Notes that 'import *' is poor practice but not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is reasonable. The code is straightforward and unlikely malicious. The low security risk is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the code is a simple import/export pattern.\n- Acknowledges that 'import *' can obscure content but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No signs of malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis, notes that 'import *' can hide malicious code but no evidence here.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious and appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward import/export, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is minimal and does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious behavior itself.\n- **Use of 'import *':** While discouraged, it is not inherently malicious. The risk hinges on the contents of 'oxiida', which are unknown.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the evidence.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher due to obscurity and potential for malicious content in 'oxiida', but overall low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current malware scores of 0 are appropriate, given no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n- The security risk could be marginally increased to 0.3 if we consider the risk of malicious content in 'oxiida', but since it's speculative, keeping it at 0.2 or below is acceptable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on an unknown module and use of 'import *')\n\n**Summary:** The code itself is benign, but the security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the 'oxiida' module. Without further inspection of 'oxiida', the risk remains low but non-zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always recommend inspecting the contents of 'oxiida' before deploying or trusting this code in a security-sensitive environment.",
