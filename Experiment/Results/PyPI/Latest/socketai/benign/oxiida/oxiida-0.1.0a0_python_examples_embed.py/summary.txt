  "conclusion": "The code is benign, demonstrating a simple FFI interface and timed workflows without malicious intent. The main concern is the external 'oxiida' library's trustworthiness, but based on the provided code, there is no malicious activity. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
