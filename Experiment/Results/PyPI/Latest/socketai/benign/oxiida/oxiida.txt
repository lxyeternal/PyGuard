      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if 'oxiida' is compromised. Scores are appropriately low, and further review of 'oxiida' is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, demonstrating a simple FFI interface and timed workflows without malicious intent. The main concern is the external 'oxiida' library's trustworthiness, but based on the provided code, there is no malicious activity. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'oxiida' module, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero, and a slight risk score to account for potential hidden malicious code within 'oxiida'."
