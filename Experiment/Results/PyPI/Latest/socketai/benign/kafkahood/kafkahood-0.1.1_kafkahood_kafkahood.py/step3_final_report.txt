  "purpose": "A Kafka client wrapper providing lazy initialization, subscription, message sending, receiving, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters from external dict, method parameters (topics, message data).",
  "sinks": "Kafka broker (sending messages), internal KafkaConsumer (polling messages).",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into KafkaConsumer and KafkaProducer; messages flow from send() to Kafka broker; poll() retrieves messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variable '_kafka_client' for singleton pattern; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Kafka client wrapper with lazy initialization, external configuration, and basic message operations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation. The global variable '_kafka_client' is a common singleton pattern but could pose design concerns. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The code relies on external configuration, which is typical, but untrusted inputs could be misused if the configuration or message data is malicious. Overall, the code appears benign with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Kafka client wrapper with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.2) scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior are detected.",
