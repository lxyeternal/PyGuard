      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or obfuscation but poses a significant supply chain and deserialization risk due to fetching external YAML data during installation and parsing it with yaml.load() without safety measures. These issues could be exploited if the external URL is compromised, leading to potential remote code execution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, but malware is unlikely unless the YAML content is maliciously crafted. Recommended mitigations include using yaml.safe_load() and avoiding external fetches during install."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a significant security vulnerability due to the use of yaml.load() with an unsafe loader. This could lead to remote code execution if the YAML file is maliciously crafted and accessible to an attacker. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious code present. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the moderate to high risk posed by unsafe YAML parsing practices. To mitigate this, the code should be updated to use yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load() with yaml.Loader."
