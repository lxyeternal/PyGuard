  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or obfuscation but poses a significant supply chain and deserialization risk due to fetching external YAML data during installation and parsing it with yaml.load() without safety measures. These issues could be exploited if the external URL is compromised, leading to potential remote code execution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, but malware is unlikely unless the YAML content is maliciously crafted. Recommended mitigations include using yaml.safe_load() and avoiding external fetches during install."
