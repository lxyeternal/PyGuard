{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for modeling and retrieving spectral data related to EUV flux based on the F10.7 index, likely for scientific or space weather analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, pandas, xarray, and a custom module seuvm._misc that retrieves data. No direct input sources within the class methods; data is fetched internally.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data output sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system calls. The code primarily processes and returns data structures in memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the internal dataset to computations via get_f, then to get_spectral_bands, which returns an xarray Dataset. No external untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of external modules appears standard; no suspicious patterns. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and a custom module for data retrieval. It defines a class that constructs a dataset using internal data, processes input F10.7 indices, and returns spectral data as xarray datasets. The get_f method handles different input types robustly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and functionality seem consistent with scientific modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility for modeling EUV spectra based on F10.7 indices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no external data leaks or suspicious network activity.",
