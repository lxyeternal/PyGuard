  "purpose": "Compute EUV spectral flux data based on F10.7 solar flux index using a scientific model with external dataset coefficients.",
  "sources": "External dataset fetched via _m.get_seuvm_ver1p(), input parameter f107 provided to get_f()",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmissions; purely computational with data returned as xarray Dataset",
  "flows": "Input f107 → get_f() processes input → get_spectral_bands() computes spectral data using coefficients → data returned as Dataset",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; reliance on external dataset source but no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward scientific model class that loads coefficients from an external source, processes input values into spectral flux data, and returns structured datasets. It performs no network, file, or system modifications. Input validation is appropriate, and the code is clear and well-structured. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present. External data dependency is typical for scientific models but could be a trust concern if the data source is malicious, which cannot be determined from the code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The external dataset source should be trusted, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. Scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
