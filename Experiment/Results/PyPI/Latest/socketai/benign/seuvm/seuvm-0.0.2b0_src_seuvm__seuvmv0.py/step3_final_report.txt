  "purpose": "Process F10.7 solar activity index values to select corresponding spectral data slices and output as an xarray Dataset for EUV flux modeling.",
  "sources": "Input F10.7 values provided to the predict method; dataset loaded via _m.get_seuvm_ver0().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is processed locally and returned as structured xarray Dataset.",
  "flows": "Input F10.7 values are categorized into index ranges, which determine dataset slices; spectra are stacked and packaged into output dataset.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input validation for F10.7 outside expected ranges (less than or equal to 60 or greater than 280) could cause undefined index 'i'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward scientific data processing class. It categorizes F10.7 values into predefined ranges to select spectral slices from a dataset. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The external dataset source appears standard. The only logical concern is missing handling for out-of-range F10.7 values, which could lead to errors but does not imply security risk. The code uses common libraries and clear logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific modeling module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only potential issue is the lack of input validation for extreme F10.7 values, which should be addressed for robustness but does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
