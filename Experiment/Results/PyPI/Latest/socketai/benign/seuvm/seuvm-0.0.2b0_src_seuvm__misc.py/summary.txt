  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for loading static datasets from package resources. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores assigned in some reports are conservative but acceptable; however, the risk score should be set to 0 to reflect the benign nature."
