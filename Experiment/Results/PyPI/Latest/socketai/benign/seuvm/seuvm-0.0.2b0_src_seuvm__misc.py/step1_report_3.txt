{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific dataset files from a package resource directory and provides functions to retrieve copies of these datasets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data files from the 'seuvm._coeffs' package resource directory using the 'files' function from 'importlib_resources'.",
  "sinks": "The code passes the filenames to 'xr.open_dataset', which loads datasets into memory. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves 'files' providing the path to dataset files, which 'xr.open_dataset' then loads into memory when functions like get_seuvm_ver0() are called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears standard for dataset loading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cached function '_read_coeffs' that loads a dataset file from a package resource directory. Multiple functions invoke this loader with specific filenames, returning copies of datasets. The use of 'importlib_resources' and 'xarray' is typical for data processing modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset loader with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to access packaged data files and return copies for use elsewhere. No vulnerabilities or malware are identified.",
