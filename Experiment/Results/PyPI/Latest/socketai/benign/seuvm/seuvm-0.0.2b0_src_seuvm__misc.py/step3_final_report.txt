  "purpose": "Load specific datasets from internal package resources using caching for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Package resource files accessed via importlib_resources.files()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; data is loaded from internal static files.",
  "flows": "Function calls to _read_coeffs with specific filenames, returning dataset copies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cached function that loads datasets from internal package resources using xr.open_dataset(). Multiple functions invoke this loader with specific filenames, returning copies. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of caching optimizes repeated access. The datasets are static resources, and the code operates solely within the package environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for loading static datasets from package resources. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk scores assigned in some reports are conservative but acceptable; however, the risk score should be set to 0 to reflect the benign nature.",
