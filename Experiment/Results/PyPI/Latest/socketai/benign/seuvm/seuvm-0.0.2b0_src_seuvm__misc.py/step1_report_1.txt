{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load specific netCDF datasets related to seismic velocity models, likely for further analysis or modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data files from the package resources directory using 'files' from 'importlib_resources'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, user data, or external data sources are present; data is loaded from internal package resources.",
  "flows": "The data flows from package resource files via 'xr.open_dataset' into cached dataset objects returned by the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The use of caching is standard for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a cached function '_read_coeffs' that loads datasets from package resources. Several functions return copies of datasets loaded via this cache. No user input, network activity, or external commands are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The resource files appear to be static datasets stored within the package, and the code's structure is straightforward and typical for data loading routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe data loading from internal package resources with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard dataset access implementation.",
