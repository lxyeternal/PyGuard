{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific NetCDF dataset files related to coefficients, likely for scientific computation, using cached functions to optimize repeated access.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files located within the 'seuvm._coeffs' resource directory via the 'files' function and '_read_coeffs' function calls.",
  "sinks": "The data is returned as xarray Dataset objects; no direct output or external communication occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input: 'files' function retrieves dataset files; output: Dataset objects returned by getter functions.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'functools.cache' for caching dataset loading is standard; no unusual or suspicious code structures are present. The resource directory and filenames seem consistent with expected dataset files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a caching function '_read_coeffs' that loads dataset files from a package resource directory using 'importlib_resources'. Multiple functions invoke this cache to load different specific dataset files and return copies. No user input, environment variables, or external network activity is present. The code appears to be standard data loading with caching, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dataset loader with caching, intended for scientific computation. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
