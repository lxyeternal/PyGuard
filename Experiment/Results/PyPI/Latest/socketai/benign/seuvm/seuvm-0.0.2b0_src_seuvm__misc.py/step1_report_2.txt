{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load specific netCDF datasets containing coefficients for seismic velocity models, likely used in geophysical analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files located within the 'seuvm._coeffs' package using importlib_resources, specifically the files '_seuvmv0_coeffs.nc', '_seuvmv1l_coeffs.nc', '_seuvmv1p_coeffs.nc', and '_seuvmv2l_coeffs.nc'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the data is read from package resources and returned as copies. There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to security risks.",
  "flows": "The functions call '_read_coeffs' which loads datasets from package resources; the datasets are then returned as copies. There are no data flows involving external untrusted inputs or outputs beyond initial file reading.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses functools.cache for caching dataset loading, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cached function to load datasets from internal package resources using importlib_resources. It offers multiple functions to retrieve different coefficient datasets, all loaded from the same resource directory. The use of cache improves performance but does not introduce security issues. The data files are accessed via package resource paths, and the code handles copying datasets to avoid side effects. No inputs from untrusted sources, nor outputs that could leak sensitive information, are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data-loading utility for scientific datasets stored within the package resources. There are no indications of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious activity.",
