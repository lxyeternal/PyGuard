{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific xarray datasets from files within a package, providing functions to access different versions of coefficients.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from the package resource 'seuvm._coeffs' directory using the 'files' function and the 'file' parameter passed to '_read_coeffs'.",
  "sinks": "The datasets returned are copies of the opened datasets, which could potentially be used for further processing or analysis, but no direct data leak or system impact is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package resource files through 'files' to 'xr.open_dataset', then to the functions that return copies of these datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file handling, or unusual code constructs are present. The use of 'functools.cache' is standard for memoization. No dynamic code execution or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and utilizes 'importlib_resources' to access package data files securely. The '_read_coeffs' function caches dataset objects for efficiency. The functions 'get_seuvm_ver0', 'get_seuvm_ver1l', 'get_seuvm_ver1p', and 'get_seuvm_ver2l' retrieve specific datasets by filename and return copies to prevent unintended modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The code's behavior is straightforward, and all data access is limited to internal resource files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical resource data loader with no indicators of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior. It functions as a safe dataset loader within a package context, with no signs of malware, security issues, or obfuscation.",
