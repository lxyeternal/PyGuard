  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports classes from internal modules of 'seuvm'. No active code, data flow, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes the lack of malicious activity. The confidence score (0.9) is high, justified by the cautious approach, but since the code is benign, this is acceptable.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk scores:** Since only imports are present, no real risk or malware is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report suggests caution due to internal modules but rightly notes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps due to the internal modules, but still reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk:** The package source is unverified, so a minor security risk is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no active code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly states no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No active malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — minimal risk, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; only imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is correct given only import statements.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the unverified source and internal modules.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** I agree with 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Given only import statements, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. Slight increases (e.g., 0.2) are acceptable if there's concern about unverified sources, but generally, they should be near zero unless further context indicates more.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (reflecting cautiousness about unverified internal modules)\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and conservative. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present in the provided code snippet.",
