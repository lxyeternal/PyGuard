  "purpose": "Import modules from the 'seuvm' package, likely for security or VM-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'seuvm._seuvmv0', 'seuvm._seuvmv1l', 'seuvm._seuvmv1p', and 'seuvm._seuvmv2'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from the same package, with no usage of dynamic code execution, environment variables, or hardcoded secrets. The modules are prefixed with underscores, indicating internal or private modules; however, this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from the 'seuvm' package. There are no functions, data processing, or suspicious behaviors present. The modules imported suggest functionality related to secure virtualization or security modules, but no malicious intent or malicious code patterns are evident. Since the code is minimal and straightforward, there are no indicators of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The imports appear standard and do not suggest supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
