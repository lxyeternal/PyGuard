{
  "purpose": "Import classes from internal modules of the 'seuvm' package, likely for security, virtualization, or related functionality.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'seuvm' internal modules (_seuvmv0, _seuvmv1l, _seuvmv1p, _seuvmv2).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not execute or process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; modules are internal and prefixed with underscores, which is standard for private modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules of a package named 'seuvm'. There is no active code, data processing, or dynamic execution. The modules are private (underscore-prefixed), indicating internal use. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The high confidence scores across reports are justified. The package 'seuvm' is not publicly well-known, but based on this snippet alone, there is no malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.1-0.2, mainly due to unverified source concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements from internal modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or active security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of the package source, which is outside the scope of this code review.",
