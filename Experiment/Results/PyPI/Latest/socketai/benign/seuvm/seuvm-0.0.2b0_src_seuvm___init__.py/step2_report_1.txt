  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only performing import statements from the 'seuvm' package and its internal modules.\n- No usage, data flow, or malicious code is visible.\n- The modules are prefixed with underscores, indicating internal/private modules, which is common in Python packages.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The 'seuvm' package and its modules are not well-known publicly, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Only imports classes; no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No evidence of malicious activity. The high confidence is justified.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar import statements, with cautious note about unverified package source.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The caution about unverified source is valid, but the code itself is benign. The securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the package's unknown origin.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Import statements only, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Import statements only, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, only imports.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** They are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n**However,** the key concern is the source and intent behind the 'seuvm' package. Since it's not a well-known library, caution is warranted, but based solely on the code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as there's no evidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the package's unknown origin, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2) is justified, especially if the package source is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Risk         | 0.1 - 0.2      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign; the scores assigned in the reports are reasonable. The only concern is the package source, which is outside the scope of this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always verify the package source and integrity in real scenarios. The code itself here shows no malicious intent.",
