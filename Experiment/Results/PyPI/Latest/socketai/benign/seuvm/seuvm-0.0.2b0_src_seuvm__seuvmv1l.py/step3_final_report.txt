  "purpose": "Scientific modeling of EUV flux spectra based on F10.7 index, retrieving data from an external source and constructing spectral datasets.",
  "sources": "External dataset retrieved via _m.get_seuvm_ver1l(), input parameter f107, dataset attributes and values.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; data is processed internally and returned as xarray Dataset.",
  "flows": "Input f107 is processed through get_f(), then used in get_spectral_bands() to compute spectral results, which are structured into datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numpy and xarray operations for scientific modeling. It retrieves data via a trusted external function, processes input flexibly, and outputs structured spectral data. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The external data source is a potential point of concern if compromised, but within this code, it appears benign. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific modeling class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The external dataset dependency is typical for such models and does not pose an inherent security risk. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
