  "purpose": "Define a linear model class for spectral data prediction based on F10.7 solar flux values.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, xarray, and a local module seuvm._misc; get_seuvm_ver1l() function call to retrieve dataset; input parameter f107 in methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output. The dataset and calculations are internally handled.",
  "flows": "Input f107 -> get_f() processes it -> get_spectral_bands() computes results -> returns xarray.Dataset with spectral data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code relies on external dataset retrieval and performs typical data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for spectral modeling using a linear approach. It imports standard libraries and a local module to retrieve data. get_f() converts input into a 2D array for model input. get_spectral_bands() performs matrix multiplication with stored coefficients. The class methods produce spectral data in xarray format. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or potentially malicious behaviors. All operations appear standard for scientific modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a spectral model with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration activities.",
