  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific modeling class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The external dataset dependency is typical for such models and does not pose an inherent security risk. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
