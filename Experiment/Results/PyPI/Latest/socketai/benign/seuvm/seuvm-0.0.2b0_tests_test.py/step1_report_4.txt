{
  "purpose": "The code primarily appears to load and utilize multiple models for spectral prediction and performs data processing, analysis, and visualization related to solar activity data.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as seuvm._seuvmv0, seuvm._seuvmv1l, seuvm._seuvmv2, and matplotlib for plotting; reads CSV files for data analysis; uses sklearn for linear regression; reads input data from local files.",
  "sinks": "Calls predict methods of imported models; outputs print statements; reads from local files; performs plotting; manipulates data frames.",
  "flows": "Model predict methods (sources) generate spectra data used for plotting and further processing; CSV file reading (sources) provides data used in regression and analysis; data manipulation feeds into regression models and plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code suggests development or experimental work; no hard-coded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network operations or data exfiltration present; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; all imports and data operations are standard for data analysis tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code involves loading models and performing spectral predictions, with commented-out sections indicating data preprocessing and statistical analysis. No malicious code or suspicious behaviors are present, such as network activity, file manipulations outside data reading, or hidden backdoors. The code is consistent with standard scientific data analysis workflows. Importantly, the code performs local data processing without external data leaks or harmful operations. There are no indicators of malware or malicious intent within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data analysis script that loads models, reads data, performs regressions, and plots spectra. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script with no security threats.",
