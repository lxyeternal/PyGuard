{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform scientific data analysis and modeling related to solar activity, including spectral predictions, statistical analysis, and regression modeling.",
  "sources": "Reading data from CSV files, importing models from 'seuvm' library, and user input via function calls (e.g., predict).",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements and plotting functions; no evidence of data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Data is read from CSVs (sources), processed with models and regression, and results are printed or plotted (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code blocks suggest exploratory or developmental work; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. No signs of backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves importing models and scientific libraries, reading data, performing statistical analysis, and plotting results. All imports and data handling appear consistent with typical scientific workflows. The presence of commented-out sections suggests developmental experimentation rather than malicious activity. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, system modification, or credential theft. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code operates within expected boundaries for scientific analysis and data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is intended for scientific data processing and modeling related to solar activity analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard scientific or analytical code with no suspicious elements.",
