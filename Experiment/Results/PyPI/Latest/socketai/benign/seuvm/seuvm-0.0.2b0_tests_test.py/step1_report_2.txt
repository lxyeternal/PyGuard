{
  "purpose": "The code appears to primarily perform scientific data analysis and modeling using custom classes, plotting, and data processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports of custom modules (seuvm._seuvmv0, _seuvmv1l, _seuvmv2), reading CSV files, and user-defined object instantiation and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Console print statements; no file write or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of 'Seuvmv0' model -> calling 'predict' method with input -> output printing; extensive data processing and statistical analysis, with commented-out sections; no clear data flow leading to untrusted sink.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code sections and complex, unused data processing routines; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external connections or obfuscated code; all imported modules are standard or related to the project, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is largely composed of data analysis, model prediction, plotting, and CSV file manipulations. It imports custom classes from the 'seuvm' package, likely for scientific modeling. The 'Seuvmv0' class is instantiated, and its 'predict' method is called with a parameter. Multiple commented-out sections suggest data pre-processing, statistical calculations, and plotting routines typical for research workflows. There are no indications of malicious code such as network communication, system manipulation, or secret exfiltration. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific data analysis script, with no malware signals or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific analysis script involving model predictions and data processing, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscated code or malware. The overall security risk is very low.",
