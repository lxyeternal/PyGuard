{
  "purpose": "The code performs scientific modeling and analysis of solar EUV flux spectra using custom models, with plotting for visualization.",
  "sources": "Model instantiation, predict method inputs (numeric F10.7 index), and data reading from CSV files (commented out).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external network activity; only local data processing and plotting.",
  "flows": "Input F10.7 index flows into model.predict(), with results used for plotting or printing; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Predominantly commented-out code, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward scientific analysis involving model predictions and plotting. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The commented sections suggest exploratory or developmental work, not malicious intent. The active code instantiates models and calls predict with a numeric value, which is typical for scientific workflows. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure and content align with legitimate scientific purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, scientific analysis code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores (close to 1) for benign nature are justified. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
