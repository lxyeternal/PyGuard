  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for modeling EUV flux spectra based on F10.7 solar activity index, using dataset-driven linear models.",
  "sources": "The code reads dataset data via _m.get_seuvm_ver2l() during class initialization; it processes input variable _f107 passed to predict() method.",
  "sinks": "The code returns an xarray Dataset object containing computed spectral data; no untrusted data output to external systems or network is observed.",
  "flows": "Input _f107 is processed through _get_spectrum() to produce spectra via matrix multiplication; resulting data is encapsulated in an xarray Dataset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are evident. Dataset fetching is via a potentially external function but appears to be benign. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input values (_f107), classifies them into spectral bands, fetches model coefficients from a dataset, computes spectra via linear algebra, and packages results in a structured dataset. All data handling appears straightforward. Dataset access is via an external function _m.get_seuvm_ver2l(), which could be a dependency but is not inherently malicious. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious side effects are present. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a linear spectral modeling class without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external dataset retrieval but does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. No vulnerabilities or malware are identified.",
