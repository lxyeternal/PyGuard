  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific modeling class with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main security concern is the external dataset dependency and the need for input validation to prevent runtime errors. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment. Minor robustness improvements are recommended but do not alter the security posture."
