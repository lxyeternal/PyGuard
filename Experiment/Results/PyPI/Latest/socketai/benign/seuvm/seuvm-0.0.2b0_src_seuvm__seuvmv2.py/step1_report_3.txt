  "purpose": "The code defines a class for modeling EUV flux spectra based on the F10.7 index, using data from an external dataset.",
  "sources": "The dataset is retrieved via _m.get_seuvm_ver2l(), which loads data from an external source or file.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data externally, write to files, or execute network operations. No untrusted data is explicitly sent or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input F10.7 index values are processed within the _get_spectrum method, leading to calculations of spectra, which are stored in variables and returned as an xarray Dataset.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard numpy and xarray operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads external data into self.dataset, processes F10.7 index values to select coefficients, performs matrix multiplication to compute spectra, and constructs an xarray Dataset for output. All operations are typical data processing steps without any hidden or malicious behavior. No network activity, file writing, or system commands are used. The dataset source is external but appears legitimate and intended for scientific modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate scientific modeling tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on external data, which is a common pattern, but does not transmit or manipulate data maliciously. The overall security risk is low.",
