  "sinks": "Potential data leak points could be network connections, file writing, or data returned from functions. No explicit sinks are identified without code details.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no source-to-sink data flows can be established or analyzed.",
  "anomalies": "The provided code snippet is empty; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to lack of code content. No sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies are detectable. The absence of code prevents detection of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. Insufficient content prevents a thorough assessment.",
