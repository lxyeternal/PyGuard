{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation, but it appears to involve importing modules, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or external inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data output functions, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow, it is difficult to identify specific source-to-sink paths. No untrusted data flow is evident from the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are visible. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and possibly some initialization or setup code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or obfuscated logic. The absence of comments or unusual constructs suggests normal functionality. Since the code snippet is minimal and does not contain any embedded malicious code or suspicious patterns, there are no apparent security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
