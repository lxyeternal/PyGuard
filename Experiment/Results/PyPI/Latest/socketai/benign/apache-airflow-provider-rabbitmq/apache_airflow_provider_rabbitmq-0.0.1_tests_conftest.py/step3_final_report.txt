{
  "purpose": "Define pytest fixtures that mock RabbitMQ connection and channel classes for unit testing purposes, facilitating testing without real network interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest.mock', 'pytest', and the patched classes/functions within the fixtures ('pika.BlockingConnection', 'pika.channel.Channel', 'aio_pika.connect_robust', 'aio_pika.abc.AbstractChannel', 'airflow.providers.rabbitmq.hooks.rabbitmq_hook.RabbitMQHook')",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands, only sets up mocks for testing",
  "flows": "Fixtures patch the respective classes/functions during test setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only creates mock objects",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard for test setup, with no suspicious or obfuscated segments",
  "analysis": "The code provides pytest fixtures that patch classes and functions from 'pika', 'aio_pika', and airflow's rabbitmq hook for mocking in tests. It does not handle untrusted data, execute commands, or contain secrets. The code is simple, correct, and serves solely for testing infrastructure. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, testing-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of testing fixtures for mocking RabbitMQ interactions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
