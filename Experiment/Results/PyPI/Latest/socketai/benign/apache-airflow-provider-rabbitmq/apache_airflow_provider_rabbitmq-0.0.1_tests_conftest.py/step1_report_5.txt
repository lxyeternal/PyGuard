{
  "purpose": "This code provides mock fixtures for testing RabbitMQ connections and channels in Python, specifically for use with pytest and mocking frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the mock.patch calls, which target specific classes and functions related to RabbitMQ connections and channels.",
  "sinks": "The mock patches replace actual connection and channel classes with mock objects, preventing real network communication. No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the fixture setup functions where mocks are applied to the targeted classes/functions, enabling controlled testing environments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly sets up mock objects for testing purposes without hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports mocking and testing libraries, then defines several pytest fixtures to mock both synchronous and asynchronous RabbitMQ connections, channels, and a specific Airflow hook. Each fixture patches a specific class or function to prevent real network activity during tests. The usage is straightforward, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code. It is a standard testing setup using mocks for RabbitMQ integrations. The code is benign and appropriate for testing environments.",
