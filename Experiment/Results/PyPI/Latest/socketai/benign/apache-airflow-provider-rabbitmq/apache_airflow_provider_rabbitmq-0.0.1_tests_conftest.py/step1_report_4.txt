  "purpose": "This code defines pytest fixtures to mock RabbitMQ connections and channels for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, mock.patch calls, and fixture definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted; no sinks for data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Fixtures patch classes and functions related to RabbitMQ connections and channels, used solely for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All mock patches appear standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard mocking techniques with the unittest.mock library to replace actual RabbitMQ connection classes and methods during tests. No code execution, data manipulation, or external communication occurs within these fixtures. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly serves to facilitate testing by mocking dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of test fixtures for mocking RabbitMQ components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is a typical testing setup with no security concerns.",
