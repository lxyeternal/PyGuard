{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock fixtures for testing RabbitMQ connections and channels using unittest.mock and pytest, primarily to facilitate unit testing of code that interacts with RabbitMQ.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the modules 'pika', 'aio_pika', and 'airflow.providers.rabbitmq.hooks.rabbitmq_hook'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially dangerous way; the code only patches classes for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "The code patches the RabbitMQ connection and channel classes, redirecting them to mock objects during tests, without processing untrusted data or executing any logic beyond mocking.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors present. The code solely creates mocks for testing RabbitMQ interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple pytest fixtures that patch specific classes related to RabbitMQ, including both synchronous (pika) and asynchronous (aio_pika) modules, as well as a specific Airflow hook. These fixtures are used to replace real network-dependent classes with mock objects during testing. No untrusted input is processed, and no sensitive data or system commands are involved. The code serves a standard testing purpose and does not include any obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of testing fixtures for mocking RabbitMQ connections in Python projects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and standard for test environments.",
