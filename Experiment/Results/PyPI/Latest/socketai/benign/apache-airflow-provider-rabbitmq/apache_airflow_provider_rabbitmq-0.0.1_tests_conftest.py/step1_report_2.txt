{
  "purpose": "The code provides mock fixtures for unit testing RabbitMQ-related components using pytest and unittest.mock.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'pika' module, 'aio_pika' module, and 'airflow.providers.rabbitmq.hooks.rabbitmq_hook.RabbitMQHook' to patch classes and functions for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause security issues, as all patches are for testing purposes and do not process external or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code intercepts the instantiation of RabbitMQ connections and channels to replace them with mock objects during tests, preventing actual network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is standard for mocking in unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest fixtures that patch classes and functions related to RabbitMQ connections and channels, both synchronous and asynchronous, for unit testing. All patches are for specific modules involved in RabbitMQ communication and testing frameworks. No untrusted data processing, no sensitive information handling, and no suspicious code are observed. The code strictly sets up mocks to avoid actual network operations during testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for mocking RabbitMQ connections and channels. It contains no malicious intent, no security risks, and is solely used for testing purposes. No evidence of malware or security threats.",
