  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, network sockets, file reads, system commands, and potentially obfuscated strings or code segments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of eval/exec, network transmission, file writing, system modifications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into eval/exec or network communication functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, base64 or hex-encoded strings, dynamic code execution, suspicious domains/IPs, incomplete or suspicious code structures, and lack of transparency in data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical in malicious scripts. Suspicious strings, obfuscated variable names, and network activity suggest potential malicious intent, though no definitive payload or harm is confirmed. Benign code shows no such indicators. The suspicion levels are moderate to high in suspicious cases, aligning with the scores. Benign cases are correctly scored as low risk. The scores in the reports are generally consistent with the described anomalies, with slight room for adjustment based on the strength of indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution features. The scores are appropriate and reflect the analysis. No critical inconsistencies are found. Continuous monitoring and further static/dynamic analysis are recommended for confirmation.",
