{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python interface for connecting to RabbitMQ, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous message publishing within an Airflow environment.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: connection URI (either provided directly or retrieved from Airflow connections).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can reach: RabbitMQ server via publish methods; errors are logged, but no data leakage or external communication beyond RabbitMQ is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (messages, connection URIs) flows from method parameters and Airflow connection retrieval into connection setup, then to message publishing via RabbitMQ channels.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected. Connection URI is built dynamically but with appropriate checks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes connections to RabbitMQ using standard libraries (pika, aio_pika), retrieves connection info securely, and manages connections with proper context managers. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; logging is for operational purposes only. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. All operations rely on standard, well-known libraries and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard RabbitMQ connection and message publishing hook for Airflow, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses typical patterns for connection management and message publishing without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
