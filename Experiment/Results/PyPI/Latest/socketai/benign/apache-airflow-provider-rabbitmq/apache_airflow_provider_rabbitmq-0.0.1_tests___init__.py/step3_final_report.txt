  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, behavior, obfuscation, and potential malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard input, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network requests, file I/O, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment or user input flows through eval()/exec() or network requests, potentially leading to data exfiltration, command execution, or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted input, obfuscation techniques, irregular variable naming, network activity during code execution, hardcoded credentials or secrets (if present).",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical benign patterns such as reading from stdin and environment variables with no suspicious behavior, aligning with a malware score of 0 and low security risk. Suspicious reports highlight dynamic code execution, network activity, and obfuscation, justifying higher malware (0.75) and obfuscation (0.6) scores. Absence of code in some reports results in zero scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The high confidence in benign assessments (0.9) for straightforward code and high suspicion (0.8) for suspicious code are appropriate. The risk scores reflect the suspicion levels, with most code being benign and one report indicating high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the benign reports are correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation levels, while the suspicious report's high scores are justified by the behaviors described. Overall, the scores are consistent and appropriate, with no discrepancies or indications of false positives.",
