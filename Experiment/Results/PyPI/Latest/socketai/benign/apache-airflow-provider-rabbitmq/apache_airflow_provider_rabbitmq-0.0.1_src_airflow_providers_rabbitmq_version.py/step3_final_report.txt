  "purpose": "Assigns __version__ based on the environment variable PACKAGE_VERSION with a default fallback.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable PACKAGE_VERSION via os.getenv()",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data beyond environment variable access",
  "flows": "Environment variable PACKAGE_VERSION influences __version__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment variable access, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and assigns __version__ from an environment variable with a default. It is a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The only consideration is that environment variables can be manipulated externally, which could lead to version spoofing, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2) due to potential environment control, which is acceptable in typical deployment scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk is due to environment variable manipulation potential, which is a known and accepted pattern, not a security vulnerability.",
