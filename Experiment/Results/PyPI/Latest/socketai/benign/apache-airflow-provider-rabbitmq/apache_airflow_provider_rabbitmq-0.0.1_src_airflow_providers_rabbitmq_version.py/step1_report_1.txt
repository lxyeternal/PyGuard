{
  "purpose": "Set the package version based on an environment variable or default to '0.1.0'",
  "sources": "os.getenv('PACKAGE_VERSION') which reads the environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data that lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' is read at runtime and assigned to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for versioning can be manipulated if environment is controlled by an attacker, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports os module and assigns __version__ based on the environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION', defaulting to '0.1.0' if not set. This is a typical pattern for setting package version dynamically, not suspicious or malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets a version string based on an environment variable, which is a standard practice. There is no malicious behavior or security risk inherent in this code.",
