{
  "purpose": "Set the package version based on an environment variable or default to '0.1.0'.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' accessed via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code; simply reading environment variable.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' is read and assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and assigns __version__ based on the 'PACKAGE_VERSION' environment variable, defaulting to '0.1.0' if not set. This is standard practice for dynamic versioning. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for setting package version via environment variable; no malicious behavior detected.",
