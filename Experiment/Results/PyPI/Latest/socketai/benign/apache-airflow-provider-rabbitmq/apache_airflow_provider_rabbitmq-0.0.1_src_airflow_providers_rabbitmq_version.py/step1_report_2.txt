{
  "purpose": "Set the package version based on an environment variable or default to '0.1.0'.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' read via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "None directly; environment variable access is safe in this context.",
  "flows": "Environment variable value flows into the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' to assign a value to __version__, with a fallback default. This is a common practice to dynamically set versioning info during deployment or testing. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply assigns a version string from an environment variable with a default fallback, a standard practice in Python packaging.",
