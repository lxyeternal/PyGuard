  "purpose": "Define package version, defaulting to '0.1.0' if environment variable is not set.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' using os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data directly used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' is read and assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and sets __version__ based on an environment variable, with a default fallback. This is a common pattern for versioning. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and clear, with no obfuscated elements or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version assignment pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
