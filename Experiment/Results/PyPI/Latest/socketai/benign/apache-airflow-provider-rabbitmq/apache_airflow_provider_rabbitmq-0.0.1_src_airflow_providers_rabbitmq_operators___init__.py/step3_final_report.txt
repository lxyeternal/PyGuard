  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in a Python package, focusing on code indicators such as network activity, obfuscation, code execution, and data handling.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include hardcoded URLs, network connection functions, eval/exec calls, environment variables, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points like network transmissions, file writes, clipboard access, and system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as hardcoded URLs or eval/exec inputs to sinks like network sockets or system commands, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious network connections, hardcoded secrets, or incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 2 exhibits multiple malicious indicators including network connections to unknown domains, use of eval/exec, obfuscation, and data exfiltration signals, justifying high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.9) scores with high confidence (0.85). Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 show benign or incomplete code with no suspicious patterns, warranting low scores (0) for malware and obfuscation, and low to moderate risk scores (0.2), with confidence levels reflecting the amount of information and suspicion. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with a minor adjustment for Report 3's obfuscation score from 0.7 to approximately 0.1 to better reflect benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment confirms that only Report 2 indicates malicious activity, with justified high malware and obfuscation scores. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor score adjustments enhance accuracy, but current scores are generally aligned with the code descriptions.",
