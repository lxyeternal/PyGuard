  "conclusion": "The overall assessment confirms that only Report 2 indicates malicious activity, with justified high malware and obfuscation scores. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor score adjustments enhance accuracy, but current scores are generally aligned with the code descriptions."
