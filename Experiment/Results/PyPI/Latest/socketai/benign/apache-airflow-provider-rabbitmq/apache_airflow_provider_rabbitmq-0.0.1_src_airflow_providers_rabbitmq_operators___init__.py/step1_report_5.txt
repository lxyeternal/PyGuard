  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or is missing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables and possibly user input (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur at network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), if such paths exist in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with typical structure. No signs of malicious or suspicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious per se. Absence of network connections, credential harvesting, or code injection points suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. The lack of any obfuscated code or unusual patterns further supports this. Without specific code snippets, detailed analysis cannot be provided, but based on available information, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and benign. Further details or specific code snippets could improve accuracy.",
