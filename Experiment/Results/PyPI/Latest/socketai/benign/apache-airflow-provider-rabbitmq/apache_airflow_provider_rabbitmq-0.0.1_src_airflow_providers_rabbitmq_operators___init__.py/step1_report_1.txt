  "purpose": "The code appears to be a sample or template for a Python script, potentially related to data processing or communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, command-line arguments, or external files (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input) through processing functions to sinks (output or network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or function calls. No unusual or malicious-looking code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure indicates typical data handling and processing routines. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or destructive commands. The absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious function calls suggests normal operation. Without specific details or hidden payloads, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a standard implementation with no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
