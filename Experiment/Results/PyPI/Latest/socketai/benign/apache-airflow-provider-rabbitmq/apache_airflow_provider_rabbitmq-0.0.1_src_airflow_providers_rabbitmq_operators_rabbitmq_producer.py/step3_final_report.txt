  "purpose": "An Airflow operator for publishing messages to RabbitMQ, supporting both sync and async modes, with connection details supplied externally.",
  "sources": "Parameters: message, exchange, routing_key, connection_uri or Airflow connection; external configuration for credentials.",
  "sinks": "RabbitMQ message exchange via hook methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into hook.publish_sync or hook.publish_async, depending on use_async flag.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an Airflow operator for RabbitMQ messaging. It correctly handles parameters, employs asyncio.run() for async calls, and manages exceptions with logging. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. External configuration reduces risk of hardcoded secrets. The use of asyncio.run() is appropriate. No signs of data leaks or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The minimal security risk stems from network communication, not code flaws. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
