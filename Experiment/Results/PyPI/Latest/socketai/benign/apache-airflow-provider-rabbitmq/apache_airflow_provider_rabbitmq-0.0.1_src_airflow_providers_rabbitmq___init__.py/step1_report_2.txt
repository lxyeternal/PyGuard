  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment block and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data inputs, or code logic that could be exploited. No sources or sinks are present, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detectable. The minimal content indicates it is part of a larger project, with no malicious behavior visible here.",
  "conclusion": "This fragment contains only descriptive comments and a version string, with no executable or data-handling code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet.",
