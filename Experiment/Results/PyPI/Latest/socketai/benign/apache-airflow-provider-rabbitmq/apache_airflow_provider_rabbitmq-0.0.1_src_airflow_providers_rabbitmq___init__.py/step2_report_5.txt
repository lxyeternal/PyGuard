  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are consistent in identifying that the provided code snippet is purely descriptive, consisting only of comments, a version string, and a module docstring.\n- There are no signs of executable logic, data input/output, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting that the reviewers are certain that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal and non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed findings:\n- The code does **not** contain any executable logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The code is a simple header/documentation for an Airflow provider module.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or summaries. All reviewers correctly interpret the code as benign and purely informational.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, given the absence of malicious content.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the minimal content and lack of executable code.\n- The slightly higher confidence (0.9) in report 5 is reasonable, but even then, the content is clearly benign.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made in any report; all correctly note the lack of code logic or configuration.\n- No false positives or unwarranted risk scores are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Remain very low (around 0.0 to 0.1), since the code is purely structural/documentational.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- Based on the provided snippet and reports, **the code is benign**.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0–0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
