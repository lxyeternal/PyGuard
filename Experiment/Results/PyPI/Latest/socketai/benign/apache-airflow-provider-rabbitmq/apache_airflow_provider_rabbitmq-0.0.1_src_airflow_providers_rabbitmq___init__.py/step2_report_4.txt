  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, consistency, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on a minimal code snippet containing only a docstring and a version string.\n- No executable code, data input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the provided snippet.\n- **Malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores:** All are zero or negligible, consistent with the minimal content.\n- **Code logic:** The code is purely descriptive; no logic or data flows are present.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent in their analysis, correctly noting the absence of suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are appropriate given the code.\n- The only slight discrepancy is report 5, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1 and confidence 0.9, despite the absence of any code logic or configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent:** All reports correctly dismiss such concerns, as the code snippet is purely structural.\n- **Potential assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is based solely on the minimal code snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code contains no executable or sensitive elements, the risk scores should remain very low, with malware and obfuscated code at zero.\n- **Report 5's slightly higher risk and confidence:** Given the minimal content, it might be more appropriate to assign a risk of 0 and confidence of 1, aligning with the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all reports and the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the snippet is a benign module header with no malicious or vulnerable elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that. The only minor adjustment might be to standardize the small risk and confidence in report 5, but overall, the assessments are sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 across all reports.  \n- Confirm that no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present based on this snippet.",
