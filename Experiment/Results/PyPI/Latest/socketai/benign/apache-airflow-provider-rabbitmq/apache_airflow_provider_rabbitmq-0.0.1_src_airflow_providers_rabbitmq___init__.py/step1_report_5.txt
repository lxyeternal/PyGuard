  "purpose": "Provide an Apache Airflow provider for RabbitMQ, including hooks, operators, and sensors for interacting with RabbitMQ.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or data; it mainly defines module metadata and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident as the code contains only comments and version info.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting of only descriptive comments, version declaration, and no executable logic or configuration. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a straightforward module header with documentation comments, version declaration, and no executable code or data handling. It does not include any logic, data input, or output points that could be exploited. Since no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected and no sensitive data or configuration is present, the risk remains negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module description with no executable content or security concerns. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
