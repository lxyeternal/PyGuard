  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform [insert purpose based on code content, e.g., data processing, network communication, utility functions, etc.].",
  "sources": "Code reads input or data from: [list sources such as environment variables, user input, network, files, etc.].",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include: [list places where data could be used in a way that causes vulnerabilities, e.g., system commands, network requests, file writes, database queries].",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through: [describe data flow paths, e.g., variable assignments, function calls, string concatenations].",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code aspects include: [list any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic code execution, or other anomalies].",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including its structure and formatting. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are evident. The code performs typical operations consistent with its apparent purpose without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not show signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate component with no immediate security risks. Confidence in this conclusion is high, with a score of 0.9. There is no indication of obfuscation, with a score of 0, and the malware risk is also negligible at 0.0. The overall security risk score is low at 0.2.",
