  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external libraries, potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, subprocess calls, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, dynamic eval/exec, obfuscation, suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Suspicious imports and data flows to network/file sinks further raise concern. Absence of such patterns suggests benign behavior. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores justified in suspicious cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity in certain cases (notably report 3), while other reports show benign or minimal risk. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, with scores consistent with the described behaviors.",
