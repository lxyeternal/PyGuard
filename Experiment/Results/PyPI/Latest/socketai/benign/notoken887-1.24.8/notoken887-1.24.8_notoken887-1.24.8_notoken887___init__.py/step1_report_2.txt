  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package, possibly for general utility or functionality extension, but the specific purpose cannot be determined as the code is absent.",

  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from input sources to sinks, as the code is missing.",
  "anomalies": "The code provided is empty or missing; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detectable.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of code, there is no logic to analyze. Without code content, no source, sink, flow, or anomaly can be identified. Therefore, no malicious behavior or security issues can be assessed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is empty or missing, making it impossible to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity is detected based on the provided input.",
