{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides methods for simple obfuscation (not secure encryption) of strings by reversing, inserting symbols, and replacing characters with emojis, and then reversing the process during decryption.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'string' parameter in encrypt() and from the 'encrypted_token' parameter in decrypt(). It also reads hardcoded strings during replacement operations.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the transformed encrypted or decrypted string. No external data sinks are present or used.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through the encryption process involving reversal and character replacement, then through the decryption process which reverses these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character and emoji replacement for obfuscation but does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The replacement operations are static and serve only for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class defines straightforward string manipulation methods for obfuscating and de-obfuscating data using reversal and character/emoji substitutions. No code injection, external calls, or system modifications are present. The only operations are local string transformations, which are benign. The code does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears solely to obfuscate data in a reversible manner, which does not inherently pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or security threats. It neither exfiltrates data nor performs harmful actions. The design is static and predictable, serving only to obscure string content. Overall, there is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
