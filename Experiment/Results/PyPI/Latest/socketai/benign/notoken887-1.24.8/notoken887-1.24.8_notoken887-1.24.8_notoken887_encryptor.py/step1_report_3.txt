{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation mechanism for strings by reversing, inserting symbols, and replacing characters with emojis.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the parameter 'string' in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs are present beyond returning the transformed string.",
  "flows": "Input string -> reverse + insert symbols -> character replacements (encrypt). Encrypted token -> symbol replacements -> remove symbols (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive character replacement with emojis to obfuscate data, but this is a benign transformation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No external network access, system modifications, or malicious actions are performed. No use of environment variables or insecure SQL. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated control flow or hidden malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The class 'TokenCryptor' provides methods for encoding and decoding strings through reversible transformations involving string reversal, insertion of separator characters, and character-to-emoji substitutions. The 'encrypt' method reverses the string, inserts '▓' between characters, and replaces alphabetic and numeric characters with emojis. The 'decrypt' method reverses this process, removing '▓' characters and restoring original characters. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only complexity is the obfuscation via emojis, which appears purely for data masking, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple reversible obfuscation tool using string manipulation and emoji substitutions. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, contains no backdoors or security risks, and appears to serve solely for data hiding or aesthetic purposes. There are no signs of malware or security threats in this module.",
