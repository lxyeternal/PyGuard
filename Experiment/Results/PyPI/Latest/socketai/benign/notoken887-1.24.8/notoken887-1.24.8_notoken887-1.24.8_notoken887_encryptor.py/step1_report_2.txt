{
  "purpose": "The code provides an obfuscation and deobfuscation mechanism for strings, likely for encoding purposes, not explicitly malicious intent.",
  "sources": "User input or external data would typically be passed to encrypt() or decrypt() functions, but no explicit input sources are shown in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; no direct data leakage or system interaction occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string is reversed and characters are replaced with symbols in encrypt(); the reverse process occurs in decrypt(). No external flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs string transformations for obfuscation without any external dependencies, network calls, or embedded secret keys. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The code appears purely for string encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class TokenCryptor with two methods: encrypt() and decrypt(). encrypt() reverses the input string, inserts a specific character between each original character, and then replaces certain characters with emojis. decrypt() reverses this process by replacing emojis back with original characters and removing the inserted characters. The logic appears to serve as an encoding or obfuscation mechanism. No system interaction, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The transformations are straightforward and only manipulate string data with predictable patterns. No anomalies like embedded secrets, external calls, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a string obfuscator, converting text to a token-like emoji representation and back. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be benign, likely used for simple encoding or aesthetic purposes.",
