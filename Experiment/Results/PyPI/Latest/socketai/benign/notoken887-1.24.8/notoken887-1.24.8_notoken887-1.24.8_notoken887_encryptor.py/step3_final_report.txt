  "purpose": "A reversible string obfuscation utility that reverses the string, inserts separator characters, and replaces characters with emojis for aesthetic or masking purposes.",
  "sources": "Input string to encrypt/decrypt functions, reading the input string parameter",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the transformed string; no external data sinks or network calls are present",
  "flows": "Input string -> reverse and insert separator -> character-to-emoji substitution -> output encrypted string; decryption reverses this process",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward reversible transformations with no hidden malicious code or external dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code only performs string reversal, insertion of separator characters, and character-to-emoji substitutions, both in encryption and decryption. There are no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The transformations are symmetric and easily reversible, serving purely as obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose appears to be aesthetic or playful obfuscation, not security or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a reversible string obfuscator with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial and easily reversible, with no external dependencies or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
