{
  "purpose": "The script reads multiple text files, extracts their content, and computes TF-IDF features for text analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads files 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', and 'tourist3.txt' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix to the console.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents (sources) -> processes with TfidfVectorizer -> outputs results (sinks). No untrusted data flow beyond reading local files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears normal. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads local text files into memory, processes them using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer, and prints the resulting vocabulary and matrix. There are no inputs from external sources like network, environment variables, or user input, nor are there outputs that send data externally. The operations are typical for text feature extraction. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard text processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It only reads local files and prints processed data, with no external communication or suspicious code activities.",
