  "purpose": "Read three local text files ('tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt'), process their contents with scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, and output the vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt' from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Printing vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix to console.",
  "flows": "File read -> Data stored in 'docs' list -> Vectorizer fit_transform -> Output printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code reads three specific local files, processes their text with TfidfVectorizer, and prints the results. No network activity, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the observed behavior. No logical flaws or security issues are evident. The code is a typical NLP preprocessing utility with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard text feature extraction without any malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
