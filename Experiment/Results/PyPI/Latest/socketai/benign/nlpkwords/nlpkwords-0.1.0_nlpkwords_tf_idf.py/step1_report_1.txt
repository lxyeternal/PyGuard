  "purpose": "Read multiple text files, extract their TF-IDF features using scikit-learn, and print the vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt' in a loop.",
  "sinks": "Printing vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix to standard output.",
  "flows": "File reading from input files -> processing with TfidfVectorizer -> printing results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward text processing without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code reads three specific text files, extracts their content, and applies scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to transform the texts into TF-IDF features. It then outputs the feature names and the resulting matrix. The code uses standard library functions and does not contain any hardcoded credentials, network communication, or obfuscated elements. The file handling is basic and appears intended for text processing. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign text processing utility with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
