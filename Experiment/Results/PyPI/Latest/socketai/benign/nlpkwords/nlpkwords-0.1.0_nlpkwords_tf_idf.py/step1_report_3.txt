{
  "purpose": "The code reads text files named 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt', processes them with TfidfVectorizer to generate a TF-IDF matrix, and outputs the vocabulary and matrix.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Outputting vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix to the console.",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) to TF-IDF transformation, then to console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, standard use of scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, no obfuscated code, no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard text processing library, reads three local text files, and applies TF-IDF vectorization. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The file reading is straightforward; output is printed to the console. No suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic appears to serve a typical NLP preprocessing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of text vectorization for three local files. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
