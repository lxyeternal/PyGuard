{
  "purpose": "The script reads multiple text files, processes them with TF-IDF vectorization, and outputs the vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix, likely for text analysis or NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input from local files named 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', 'tourist3.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix to the console.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (source) and processes with TfidfVectorizer; outputs data to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Uses standard library 'sklearn'. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. File input is straightforward; no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard scikit-learn module, reads three local text files into memory, and processes them with TfidfVectorizer to generate a vocabulary and TF-IDF matrix. No user input sanitization, external network communication, or environment variable misuse observed. No embedded malicious code or anomalies. The code is typical for text processing and appears benign. It relies on local files, and there are no indications of data leakage or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard NLP text vectorization script without any malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads local files, processes text data, and prints results. No malware or security issues detected.",
