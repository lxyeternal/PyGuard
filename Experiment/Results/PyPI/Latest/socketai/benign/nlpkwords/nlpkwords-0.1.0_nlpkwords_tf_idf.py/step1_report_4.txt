{
  "purpose": "Read multiple text files and compute their TF-IDF vectors using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer.",
  "sources": "Reads 'tourist1.txt', 'tourist2.txt', and 'tourist3.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files (sources), processes with TfidfVectorizer (no external sinks involved).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward text file reading and processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, reads three text files into memory, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and prints the vocabulary and matrix. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple NLP preprocessing script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text processing script that reads local files and computes TF-IDF vectors. There is no malware, malicious behavior, or security risk observed.",
