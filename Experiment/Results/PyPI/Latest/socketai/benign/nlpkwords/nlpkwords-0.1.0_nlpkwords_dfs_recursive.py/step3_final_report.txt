{
  "purpose": "Reads a CSV file to construct an undirected graph and performs a DFS traversal starting from user input.",
  "sources": "CSV file 'graph.csv' with 'Source' and 'Destination' columns, user input for start node",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems",
  "flows": "Input from user (start node) to DFS traversal; CSV data to graph construction",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file to build an undirected graph, then performs a recursive DFS starting from a user-specified node. It uses standard pandas functions and simple data structures. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. User input is accepted without validation, but this does not introduce security risks in this context. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) aligns with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for graph reading and traversal. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
