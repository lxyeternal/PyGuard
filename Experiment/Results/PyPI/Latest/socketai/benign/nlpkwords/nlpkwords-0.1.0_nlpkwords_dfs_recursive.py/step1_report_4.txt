{
  "purpose": "The code reads a graph structure from a CSV file and performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from a user-specified node.",
  "sources": "The CSV file specified by 'file_path', and user input for the starting node.",
  "sinks": "The user input for the starting node and the printed traversal output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the CSV into the graph structure, from user input to the start node, and from the graph traversal to console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious external network activity or obfuscation detected. Use of pandas is standard for CSV reading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas for CSV processing, constructs an undirected graph, and performs DFS. User input is used directly for traversal, which is typical and safe as it doesn't lead to code injection or data leaks. No dynamic code execution or external connections are present. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of reading a graph from CSV and performing DFS. No malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe based on the provided code.",
