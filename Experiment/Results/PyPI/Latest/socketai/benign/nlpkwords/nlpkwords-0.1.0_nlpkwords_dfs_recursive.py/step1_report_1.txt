{
  "purpose": "The code reads a graph from a CSV file and performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from a user-provided node.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the CSV file ('graph.csv') and user input ('start_node').",
  "sinks": "The user input ('start_node') could influence the traversal path, but there are no sinks leading to data leakage or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the CSV file into the graph structure, and from user input into the DFS function to determine traversal starting point.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of pandas for CSV reading is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a graph from a CSV file, constructs an undirected graph, and performs a DFS starting from a user-defined node. The code uses standard libraries and functions with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The input prompt for the start node is safe; the data from CSV is used only for graph construction. No external network connections, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of reading graph data and performing DFS. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe with no security concerns detected.",
