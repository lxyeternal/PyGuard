  "purpose": "Read a graph from a CSV file and perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from user-input node.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file ('graph.csv') using pandas.read_csv(), user input via input() function.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is outputted or transmitted externally, no code injection points, no sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "CSV data is read into the graph structure; user input determines start node for DFS; no untrusted data flows into dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. Use of pandas for CSV parsing is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious code activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pandas to read graph data from a CSV file, constructs an undirected graph, then performs DFS from a user-provided starting node. It uses standard methods for reading files and user input, with no unsafe or malicious code present. No data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script for graph traversal, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It relies on standard libraries and operations, with safe handling of data. No malware, no obfuscated code, and low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
