{
  "purpose": "The code reads a graph from a CSV file and performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from a user-specified node.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a CSV file ('graph.csv') and user input via input() for the starting node.",
  "sinks": "Uses print() to output nodes during traversal; accepts user input for the starting node.",
  "flows": "Reads data from CSV -> user inputs starting node -> DFS traversal prints nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no data leakage, and no unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a CSV file containing graph data with 'Source' and 'Destination' columns, constructing an undirected graph. It then prompts the user to input a starting node, which initiates a recursive DFS traversal, printing each visited node. All data handling appears straightforward and standard. There are no signs of malicious code, such as hidden network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of user input and file reading is typical for graph traversal scripts. No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and solely designed for graph traversal based on CSV input. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
