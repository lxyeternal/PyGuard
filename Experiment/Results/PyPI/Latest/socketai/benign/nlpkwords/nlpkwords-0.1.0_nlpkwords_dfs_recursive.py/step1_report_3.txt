{
  "purpose": "Performing a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a graph read from a CSV file.",
  "sources": "Reading CSV file 'graph.csv' via pandas.read_csv; accepting user input for start node.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified for untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "User input for start_node is used directly in dfs_recursive without validation; data read from CSV is used to construct a graph; traversal is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code simply reads and processes data as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file to build an undirected graph and performs a DFS traversal starting from a user-provided node. The CSV reading uses pandas without executing code or parsing untrusted code snippets. User input for the start node is used directly, but this is typical for CLI tools. No malicious or suspicious operations such as network activity, file modification, or data exfiltration are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the implementation is straightforward and typical for graph traversal tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard graph traversal based on input data, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe and does not pose supply chain risks.",
