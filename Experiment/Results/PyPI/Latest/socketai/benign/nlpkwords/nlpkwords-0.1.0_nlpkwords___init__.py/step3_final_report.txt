{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, environment variable reading, or network communication, but no malicious intent or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external data sources",
  "sinks": "Potential system commands, network endpoints, data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env vars) to sinks (system/network)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or placeholder in some reports, with no data flow or logic. Where data sources are present, no malicious activity or obfuscation is observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the lack of suspicious features. Overall, the code is deemed safe, with minimal inherent risk due to potential data handling but no active threats or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets across all reports are benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
