  "purpose": "The code reads text from a file, cleans it, removes stopwords, performs spell correction, and outputs the processed tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'textfile.txt' on the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed tokens to the console via print().",
  "flows": "File read (source) -> text cleaning -> tokenization -> stopword removal -> spell correction -> output (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Uses external libraries (NLTK, TextBlob) appropriately. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary NLP libraries and ensures their resources are available. It reads a local file 'textfile.txt', processes the text by cleaning and tokenizing, removes stopwords, then applies spell correction on each token using TextBlob. The processed tokens are printed to the console. There is no code for network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of TextBlob for spell correction is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and intended for text processing purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical NLP preprocessing tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads local data, processes it, and outputs results without any suspicious activities. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
