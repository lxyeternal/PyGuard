  "purpose": "The code reads a local text file, cleans the text, tokenizes, removes stopwords, performs spell correction, and outputs the processed tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'textfile.txt', input text read via open() function.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print(), no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> text cleaning -> tokenization -> stopword removal -> spell correction -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard NLP preprocessing using well-known libraries (NLTK, TextBlob). It includes resource checks and downloads necessary datasets. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with local file processing. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.95), given the code's simplicity and benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
