{
  "purpose": "This code reads a text file, cleans and processes the text by removing non-alphabetic characters, stopwords, and corrects spelling errors using TextBlob, then outputs the processed tokens.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'textfile.txt' on the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a print statement displaying processed tokens; no data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input from 'textfile.txt' is cleaned, tokenized, stopwords removed, and spelling corrected, then printed. No external data flows or network connections are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of TextBlob for spelling correction is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads a local file, processes the text with standard NLP libraries, and outputs results to the console. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor data exfiltration mechanisms. All operations are straightforward text processing tasks, with proper resource management and error handling for nltk data downloads. No malicious intent or suspicious anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical NLP preprocessing tasks with no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage. It is safe for use in its intended purpose.",
