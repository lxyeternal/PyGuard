  "purpose": "The code reads text from a file, cleans, tokenizes, removes stopwords, and corrects spelling errors in the text.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'textfile.txt' on the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Prints the processed tokens to the console.",
  "flows": "Reads from file -> cleans text -> tokenizes -> removes stopwords -> corrects spelling -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. Uses standard libraries with no suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script performs text processing using standard NLP libraries (NLTK and TextBlob). It includes logic for downloading necessary datasets if missing. It reads data locally, processes it, and outputs the results. There are no code injections, network communications, or suspicious behaviors present. The code appears to be a benign text processing utility. It does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard NLP processing script with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attack. It solely reads a local file, processes the text, and outputs the tokens. No malicious behavior or malware is detected.",
