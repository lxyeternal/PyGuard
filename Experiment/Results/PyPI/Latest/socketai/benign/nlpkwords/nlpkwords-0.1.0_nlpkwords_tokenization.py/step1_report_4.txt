  "purpose": "The code processes a text file by cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and correcting spelling errors in the text.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the file 'textfile.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Outputting processed tokens via print statement.",
  "flows": "File read -> text cleaning -> tokenization -> stopword removal -> spelling correction -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs typical NLP preprocessing tasks. No use of external network calls beyond nltk downloads which are standard. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary NLP libraries and ensuring nltk datasets are available. It defines functions to clean text by removing non-alphabetic characters, normalize whitespace, and convert to lowercase. It also corrects spelling using TextBlob. The main function reads a text file, cleans and tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, corrects spelling, and prints the final tokens. No malicious network activity, credential handling, or system modification code is present. The usage of TextBlob for spelling correction is benign and commonly used for NLP purposes. Overall, the code appears to be standard NLP preprocessing with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard NLP preprocessing script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads input from a file, processes the text, and outputs tokens, all of which are typical operations without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
