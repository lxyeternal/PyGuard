{
  "purpose": "The code performs fuzzy set operations such as intersection, complement, and union on predefined dictionaries representing fuzzy sets.",
  "sources": "The data is read from hardcoded dictionaries 'fuzzy1' and 'fuzzy2' within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "Data is output via print statements; no untrusted data sources or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded input dictionaries through set operations (intersection, complement, union) to print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses straightforward set and dictionary operations to manipulate fuzzy set data. There are no external inputs, network connections, or system modifications. The functions are standard and perform basic mathematical operations on in-memory data structures. The code lacks any dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious payloads. It appears to be an academic or utility script for fuzzy set calculations, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for fuzzy set operations with hardcoded data, containing no malicious behavior or security risks.",
