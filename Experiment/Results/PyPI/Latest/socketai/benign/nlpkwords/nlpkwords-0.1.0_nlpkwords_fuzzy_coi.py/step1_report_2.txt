{
  "purpose": "Performs fuzzy set operations including intersection, complement, and union of complements, and outputs the results.",
  "sources": "Data sources are hardcoded dictionaries fuzzy1 and fuzzy2 within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data or external data flow; no external I/O aside from print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded dictionaries through set operations and functions, then outputs via print. No external untrusted data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard set and dictionary operations with no obfuscated, dynamic, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for fuzzy set operations: intersection, complement, and union of complements. The main() function initializes two example fuzzy sets, performs these operations, and prints results. All operations are straightforward and rely solely on predefined data structures. There are no external data inputs, no sensitive data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of fuzzy set operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It purely performs mathematical set operations on hardcoded data and outputs the results.",
