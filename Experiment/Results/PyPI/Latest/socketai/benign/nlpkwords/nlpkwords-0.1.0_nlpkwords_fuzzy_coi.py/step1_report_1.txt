{
  "purpose": "Performs fuzzy set operations such as intersection, complement, and union on dictionaries representing fuzzy sets.",
  "sources": "Data sources are the predefined dictionaries fuzzy1 and fuzzy2 within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output the results of computations; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code reads from fuzzy set dictionaries, processes data through functions, and outputs results via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code logic appears straightforward and mathematical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for fuzzy set operations: intersection, complement, and union. These are applied to sample data within main(). The data is hardcoded, and results are printed. No external inputs, network communications, or system manipulations are present. The code performs standard mathematical operations without any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic fuzzy set operations with hardcoded sample data. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contain malicious intent, or pose security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
