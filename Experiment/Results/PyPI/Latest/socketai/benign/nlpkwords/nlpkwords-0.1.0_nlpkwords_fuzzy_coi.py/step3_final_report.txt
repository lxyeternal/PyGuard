{
  "purpose": "Performs fuzzy set operations (intersection, complement, union) on predefined static dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionaries within the code (fuzzy1, fuzzy2, intersection_set, complement_fuzzy1, complement_fuzzy2).",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting results; no external data inputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded dictionaries through set operations to print outputs; no external untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and mathematically correct. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic fuzzy set functions and applies them to static data. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions perform standard set operations with correct logic. The data is hardcoded, and outputs are via print statements. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is clear, simple, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of fuzzy set operations on static data with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The analysis confirms the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
