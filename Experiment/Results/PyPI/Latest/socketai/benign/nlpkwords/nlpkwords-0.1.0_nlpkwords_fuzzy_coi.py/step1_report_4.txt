{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform fuzzy set operations, specifically intersection, complement, and union of fuzzy sets, and outputs the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined dictionaries 'fuzzy1' and 'fuzzy2' within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (fuzzy sets) are processed through intersection and complement functions, and results are printed; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The functions perform straightforward set operations without complex or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for fuzzy set operations: intersection and complement, then combines these in main(). The operations are standard mathematical procedures on dictionaries representing fuzzy sets. No external data input, no network activity, and no malicious code are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and performs purely computational tasks with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of fuzzy set operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a mathematical or data processing purpose without any malicious intent.",
