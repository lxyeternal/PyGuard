{
  "purpose": "The code performs fuzzy set operations such as intersection, complement, and union of fuzzy sets represented as dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined dictionaries (fuzzy1, fuzzy2) within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print statements, which are standard and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined input dictionaries to the functions for set operations, then results are printed. No untrusted input sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses straightforward dictionary operations to perform fuzzy set calculations. It defines functions for intersection and complement, then applies these in main() with static data. The functions and data are standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No external data sources, no network activity, and no hidden code. The output is simply printed results of the computations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of fuzzy set operations with static data. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard mathematical computation module.",
