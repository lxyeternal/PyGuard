  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; no network activity or external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a static README file, specifies dependencies, and defines package metadata. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. All operations are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging setup with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and scores are appropriate.",
