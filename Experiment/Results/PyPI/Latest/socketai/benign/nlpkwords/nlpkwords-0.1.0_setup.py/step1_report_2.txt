  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is being used or outputted.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content, pass it as long_description to setup(), no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The email address and URL are publicly known, not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures using setuptools, reading a Markdown file for description, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. All activities are typical for a setup script. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and nothing suspicious is found. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated elements. Overall, the code appears safe and standard.",
