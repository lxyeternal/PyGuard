{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'nlpkwords' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads package dependencies from 'install_requires'; reads package metadata from parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data outputs or external system calls.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. Standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package dependencies, author info, and metadata. No dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets beyond publicly available metadata, and no external calls that could indicate malicious activity. Usage of 'find_packages()' is standard, and the dependencies are common ML/NLP libraries. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. All operations are read-only file access and package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
