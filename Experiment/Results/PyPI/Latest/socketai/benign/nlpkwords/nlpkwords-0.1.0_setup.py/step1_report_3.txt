  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python NLP/ML library called 'nlpkwords'.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external commands; no network connections, file modifications, or system alterations are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads a static file for metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard setup tools and dependency declarations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a README file for description, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. Dependencies are typical for NLP/ML projects and are version-specified. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It simply prepares the package for distribution without any suspicious or malicious code.",
