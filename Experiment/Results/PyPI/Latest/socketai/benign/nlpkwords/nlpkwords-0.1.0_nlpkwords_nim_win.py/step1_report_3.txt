  "purpose": "This code implements a simple command-line Nim game where the user plays against the computer.",
  "sources": "Input functions: input() for initial stones, player name, and moves; possibly user inputs for moves.",
  "sinks": "Input validation and user prompts; no data is sent over the network or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "User inputs are read at the start and during the game; game logic determines moves; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The move logic for the computer is deterministic but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Nim game with user interaction via console inputs. It validates user input for the player's move, ensuring only allowed moves are accepted. The computer makes a move based on a simple strategy to leave multiples of 4, which is typical for Nim. There are no network operations, no file handling, no external data access, or obfuscated code. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or backdoors. It simply performs in-memory game logic with user prompts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of a Nim game with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal.",
