{
  "purpose": "A simple command-line Nim game allowing a user to play against a basic computer opponent.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`input`) for initial stones count, player name, and move; standard output (`print`) statements for interaction.",
  "sinks": "Input data from the user, which affects game state and flow; no data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs determine game progression; move input influences stones count; game state updates; no external or untrusted data flows outside the input/output cycle.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The computer's move logic is simple and predictable, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward Nim game with user interaction via input prompts and print statements. The player's move is validated and used to modify the game state. The computer makes moves based on a basic strategy. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code appears safe, with standard input validation and no hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, educational implementation of the Nim game with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply interacts with the user via command line and does not perform any harmful actions.",
