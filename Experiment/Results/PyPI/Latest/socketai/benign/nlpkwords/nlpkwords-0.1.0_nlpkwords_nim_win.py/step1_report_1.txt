  "purpose": "A simple command-line Nim game where a user plays against the computer.",
  "sources": "Input functions (input()) for user input; print() statements for output.",
  "sinks": "Input data from user; no data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "User inputs move, which affects game state; no external data flow or untrusted data being sent or received outside local input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The computer's move logic is straightforward and based on a standard Nim strategy.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward Nim game with user interaction. It reads user input for the initial stones, player name, and move choices. The computer's move is calculated based on a simple strategy to win. There are no network operations, no file handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. All input and output are local and user-driven. No secret keys, credentials, or system commands are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign implementation of a Nim game for user entertainment. It contains no malicious or maliciously-inclined behavior, no suspicious external interactions, and no security risks identified.",
