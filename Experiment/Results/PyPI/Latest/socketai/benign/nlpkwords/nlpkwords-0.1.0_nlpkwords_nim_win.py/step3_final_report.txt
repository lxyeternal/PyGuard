  "purpose": "A simple command-line Nim game allowing user interaction and computer moves based on standard strategy.",
  "sources": "User input for initial stones, player name, and move choices; computer move logic based on current stones.",
  "sinks": "Input validation ensures moves are within allowed range; no external data or network interactions involved.",
  "flows": "User inputs data -> validation -> game state updates -> computer move logic -> game outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Nim with standard input/output, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. Input validation is proper, and the computer's move strategy is typical for Nim. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with all assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores. The code poses no security threat and functions as an educational game.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is a simple, well-structured implementation of Nim suitable for educational purposes. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
