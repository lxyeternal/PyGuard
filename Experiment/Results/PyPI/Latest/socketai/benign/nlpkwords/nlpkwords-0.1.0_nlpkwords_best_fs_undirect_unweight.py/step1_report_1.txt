{
  "purpose": "Implement a best-first search algorithm with user-defined graph and heuristics inputs.",
  "sources": "User inputs for number of edges, edges (u v), number of nodes for heuristics, heuristic values for nodes, start node, and goal node.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code only takes input and processes data; it does not send data externally or access sensitive information.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> Data stored in graph and heuristics dictionaries -> search process uses these data structures to find a path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code relies on user input without validation but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically builds a graph and heuristics based on user input, then performs a best-first search. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The input prompts and data processing are straightforward. The code does not contain code injection points or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a graph search algorithm that relies on user input. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a benign script intended for educational or demonstrative purposes.",
