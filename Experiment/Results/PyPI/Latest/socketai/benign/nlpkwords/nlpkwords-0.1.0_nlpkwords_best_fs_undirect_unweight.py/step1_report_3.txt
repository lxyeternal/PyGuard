{
  "purpose": "Implements a best-first search algorithm for pathfinding in a user-defined graph with heuristics, with interactive input for graph construction and search parameters.",
  "sources": "Input functions: reading number of edges, edges (u v), number of nodes for heuristics, heuristic values, start node, and goal node.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that lead to data leaks or external communications; no code that writes or transmits data over the network or filesystem.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user input to internal data structures; data used internally for graph traversal; no external output other than print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for dynamic data collection; no hardcoded secrets; straightforward graph and heuristics creation; no obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard best-first search with user-defined graph and heuristics. It collects data via input prompts, stores data in dictionaries and sets, and outputs the search progress via print statements. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, file manipulation, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, intended for educational or debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign implementation of a graph search algorithm with interactive data entry. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
