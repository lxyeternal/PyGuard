{
  "purpose": "Implements a best-first search algorithm that reads graph structure and heuristics from user input, then performs the search from a start node to a goal node.",
  "sources": "User inputs for number of edges, edges themselves, number of nodes for heuristics, heuristics values, start node, and goal node.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data over networks, access system files, or execute commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> data stored in variables -> used within the search algorithm.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'input()' for data collection, which is expected; no unusual code constructs or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads graph data and heuristics from user input, then performs a standard best-first search. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise. The use of 'input()' indicates data collection from a user rather than an external untrusted source; no network or file operations with external untrusted data are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a best-first search with interactive user input. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, nor any security risks. It appears safe for use, assuming the input is from a legitimate user.",
