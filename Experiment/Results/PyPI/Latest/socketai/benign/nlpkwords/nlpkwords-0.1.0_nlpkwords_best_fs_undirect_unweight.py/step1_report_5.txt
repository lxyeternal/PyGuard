{
  "purpose": "Implements a best-first search algorithm with user-provided graph and heuristics input, then searches for a goal node.",
  "sources": "User input for number of edges, edges themselves, number of nodes with heuristics, heuristics for each node, start node, and goal node.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; primarily data collection from user input and printing outputs.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected, used to build graph and heuristics structures; these are then used within the search algorithm to traverse nodes based on heuristics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard input handling, no obfuscated or malicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers input to build a graph and heuristic map, then performs a best-first search algorithm. Input data is only used for data structures and control flow; no external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration are present. No code injection points or unsafe operations are evident. The flow is straightforward, and the logic is typical for a graph search implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a best-first search with user input; it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads input, processes data, and outputs search progress. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
