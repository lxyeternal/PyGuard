  "purpose": "Implementing a best-first search algorithm for pathfinding based on heuristics, with user input to create the graph and heuristics dynamically.",
  "sources": "Input functions: prompts for number of edges, edges (u v), number of nodes for heuristics, node heuristics, start node, and goal node.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of input data: graph construction, heuristics, start, and goal nodes are directly used in the search process without sanitization or validation.",
  "flows": "User input -> graph and heuristics data structures -> best_first_search traversal (reads graph and heuristics, outputs nodes, and checks for goal)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs a graph and heuristics from user input, then performs a best-first search. It relies entirely on user-provided data, which is typical for a pathfinding demo. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Input is used to build data structures without sanitization but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and functions as expected for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a user-driven best-first search algorithm for educational or demonstration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It reads input, processes data, and outputs traversal nodes, all in a benign manner.",
