{
  "purpose": "The code reads text from a file, cleans it, tokenizes, stems, lemmatizes, and then creates triplets of lemmatized words for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'textfile.txt' on the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input directly lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no network or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> cleans text -> tokenizes -> stems -> lemmatizes -> creates triplets.",
  "anomalies": "Uses nltk.download() calls within the script, which could indicate dynamic resource fetching but is typical for setup, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard text processing steps with the nltk library: downloading necessary datasets, reading a local file, processing text, and outputting word triplets. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The operations are straightforward NLP preprocessing without external network communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign NLP preprocessing script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is typical for a text analysis pipeline.",
