{
  "purpose": "The code reads a text file, cleans and tokenizes its content, applies stemming and lemmatization, and generates triplets of words for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'textfile.txt' on disk.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed triplets to the console via print(). No untrusted data is written elsewhere or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read (source) through cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization (processing steps), ending with printing the triplets (output).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing with no suspicious or unusual operations. It includes multiple NLTK downloads, which could be unnecessary or redundant in some environments but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports re and nltk modules, downloads necessary datasets, defines a cleaning function to strip non-alphabetic characters, and processes the text file by tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing words. It then creates triplets of words for potential analysis. No code appears to perform malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. All operations are typical NLP preprocessing steps.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard NLP text preprocessing script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely processes a text file and outputs processed triplets without involving external communications or sensitive data handling.",
