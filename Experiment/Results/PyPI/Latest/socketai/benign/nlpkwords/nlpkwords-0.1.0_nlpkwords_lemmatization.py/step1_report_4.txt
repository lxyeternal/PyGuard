{
  "purpose": "The script reads a text file, cleans and processes its contents by tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing words, and then outputs triplets of lemmatized words.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'textfile.txt' using open() and file.read()",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output via print()",
  "flows": "Reads from file -> cleans text -> tokenizes -> stems and lemmatizes -> forms triplets -> prints output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no code obfuscation, and no malicious functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing steps: cleaning text with regex, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and triplet formation. All operations are contained within a straightforward main() function with no external data transmissions or manipulations beyond reading a local file and printing results. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code execution is evident. The nltk.download() calls are typical for setup and do not pose security issues. The script's purpose appears solely to process and output text data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate text processing tasks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads a local file, processes its content, and outputs results without engaging in suspicious activities or handling sensitive data improperly.",
