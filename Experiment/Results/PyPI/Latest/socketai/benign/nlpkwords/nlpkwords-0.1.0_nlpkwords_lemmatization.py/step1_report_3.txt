{
  "purpose": "The script reads a text file, cleans and tokenizes its content, applies stemming and lemmatization, and generates triplets of lemmatized words.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file 'textfile.txt' using open('textfile.txt', 'r') as file.",
  "sinks": "The script only outputs processed triplets to the console; no data is sent over a network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input file content -> cleaning and tokenization -> stemming and lemmatization -> triplet creation -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of standard NLP libraries and straightforward file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text preprocessing using NLTK and regular expressions. It reads from a local file, processes text, and outputs results. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data. The library downloads are common in NLP workflows. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign NLP preprocessing script with no malicious intent. It reads a file, processes text, and outputs data locally without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
