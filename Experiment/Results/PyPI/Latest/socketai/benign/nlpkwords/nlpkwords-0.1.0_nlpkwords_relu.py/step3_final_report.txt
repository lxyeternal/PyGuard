{
  "purpose": "A simple neural network training script implementing forward and backward propagation with random initialization, designed for educational or experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "User input for number of inputs, random data generation for inputs and expected outputs, random weight and bias initialization.",
  "sinks": "Console output of final predictions, weights, and biases; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data from user and random generators flow through the network layers via dot products and activation functions, with gradients computed during backpropagation and weights updated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard neural network training loop using numpy, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. It accepts user input, generates random data, performs training, and outputs results. The logic is consistent, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are evident. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified given its benign, educational nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a neural network training routine with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. It is safe for use in educational or experimental contexts.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
