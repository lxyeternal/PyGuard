{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple neural network training routine using numpy, accepting user input to define the number of inputs, performing forward and backward propagation, and updating weights accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the user via input() function for the number of inputs. Data is generated internally using np.random.randint for inputs and expected output. Model parameters (weights and biases) are initialized randomly within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is primarily used within the training process; no external sinks like network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration are present. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input from user affects data shape; data flows through random initialization, forward pass, backpropagation, and weight updates within the training loop. No external data flows back or out; results are printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs straightforward neural network training without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neural network operations: data input, random data generation, forward pass, backpropagation, and weight updates. No external data sources or sinks are involved besides user input and print statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears to be a benign demonstration of training a simple neural network with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of neural network training for educational or experimental purposes. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
