{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple neural network training process using NumPy, with input, forward pass, backward pass, and weight updates, primarily for educational or experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads user input for the number of inputs (via input()), generates random input data (np.random.randint), and initializes weights and biases with random values (np.random.rand).",
  "sinks": "Outputs the final prediction and weights/biases to the console (print statements). No data is sent over the network or written to external files.",
  "flows": "Input from user -> random data generation -> neural network computation (forward pass) -> error calculation -> backward pass for gradients -> weight updates -> final output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of standard NumPy functions, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard neural network training with ReLU activations, gradient descent, and random data generation. All operations are typical for such a model. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security issues are evident. The code's purpose appears to be educational or experimental. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a simple neural network training loop with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and designed for educational use.",
