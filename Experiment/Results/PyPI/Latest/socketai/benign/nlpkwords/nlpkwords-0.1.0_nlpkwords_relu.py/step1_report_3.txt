  "purpose": "This script implements a simple neural network training process with random input data, weights, and biases, aiming to perform a basic machine learning task.",
  "sources": "Input from user via 'input()' function for number of inputs; random data generated with np.random.randint and np.random.rand",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the final prediction and weights/biases to the console using print statements",
  "flows": "User input -> Data generation -> Forward pass computations -> Backward pass computations -> Weight updates -> Final output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard NumPy operations and simple logic. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neural network training using NumPy, with random initial weights and data. The input() call for number of inputs is a normal method to get user data. Data is generated randomly and not from untrusted sources. The training loop updates weights normally without hidden or suspicious logic. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. No external network connections, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a benign demonstration of a neural network training process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a simple neural network training routine with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malware. It appears to be a benign educational or experimental script.",
