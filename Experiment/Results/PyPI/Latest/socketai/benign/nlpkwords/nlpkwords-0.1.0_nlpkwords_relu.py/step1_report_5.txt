{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple neural network training process with multiple layers using numpy, including forward and backward propagation, weight updates, and user input for data size.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function; random number generation for input data, weights, and biases using np.random.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements; no data is written to external files or sent over the network; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "User input (N) -> Random data (X, Y, weights, biases) -> Forward propagation -> Backward propagation -> Weight updates -> Final outputs displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard neural network implementation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code takes user input for the number of inputs, initializes random weights and biases, performs 1000 epochs of training using ReLU activation, and outputs the final predictions and parameters. All operations are standard for a basic neural network training script. No network connections, system modifications, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a small neural network training routine with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It solely performs data generation, training, and output display with no harmful or malicious features.",
