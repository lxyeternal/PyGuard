{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'mcp_query', including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading 'README.md' into 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without explicit validation or error handling is typical; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and reads a README file for the long description. The use of 'open' with error='ignore' is common to avoid errors if the file is missing. No external data processing, user input, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
