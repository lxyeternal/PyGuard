{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup parameters for the 'mcp_query' Python package, including package discovery, dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Input source is the open() call reading 'README.md' for the long_description field.",
  "sinks": "The 'open()' function potentially reads an external file, which could be manipulated or malicious if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'README.md' into 'long_description' which is then used as package metadata; no further data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open()' directly in the setup configuration without error handling may lead to exceptions if the file is missing or inaccessible, but this is standard practice. No suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure the package, including package discovery ('find_packages()'), dependencies (empty list), and entry points for CLI. The only external file accessed is 'README.md' for documentation purposes, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The use of 'open()' for reading the README is standard for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures the package's metadata and entry points, with minimal external interaction. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
