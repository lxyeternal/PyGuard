  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and reads 'README.md' for long description.\n- No user input, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only external file read is 'README.md', with error suppression.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Accurate; confirms the code is straightforward, no malicious behavior, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Also accurate; notes standard practices, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above; mentions the use of 'open()' with 'errors=\"ignore\"', which is common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk is slightly above zero but still very low.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a standard setup script.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is acceptable, considering the minimal risk associated with ignoring errors in file reading.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous; emphasizes the standard nature of the script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; confirms no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores & Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 for the minor issue of ignoring errors when reading 'README.md'. This is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal, related to error suppression in file reading, which is common in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
