{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'mcp_query', intended to facilitate package installation and configuration, including defining command-line entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description during setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data; the setup process does not handle user input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading 'README.md' content to include in package metadata, which is a controlled file read operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code opens 'README.md' without handling potential errors (e.g., file not found) explicitly, but it does so with 'errors=\"ignore\"', which is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies (none specified), and console script entry points. It reads 'README.md' to populate 'long_description' with error suppression. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that could leak data, nor suspicious or malicious code behaviors. The structure and content are typical for a package setup script. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with no malicious intent, supply chain risks, or security issues. It is a typical package configuration file, and no suspicious behavior or malware is present.",
