  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'mcp_query', including package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks; no network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file and uses its content for 'long_description' during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets. The code adheres to standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and configuration. It reads a local file 'README.md' for documentation purposes, with error handling. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security concern indicators. It appears safe and legitimate.",
