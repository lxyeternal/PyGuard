  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'mcp_query' for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' to set 'long_description'; no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' within the 'setup' function, but with a fallback that does not specify alternative content. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script for packaging a Python project. It includes typical parameters such as name, version, packages, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, but it includes an error handling fallback. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. The script appears clean and straightforward, consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares a Python package for distribution without processing untrusted input or executing hidden operations.",
