  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or module, but due to the absence of any visible code, functions, or logic, its intended functionality cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "No identifiable input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data fetching mechanisms are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks, system modifications, or network activity, given the lack of executable code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are observable due to the absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty with no executable statements, variables, or imports. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The lack of content makes it impossible to detect malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no logic, functions, or data flows to analyze. Without code, there are no potential sources, sinks, or anomalies to evaluate. This could be an incomplete snippet or an empty file. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred from nothing.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign by default, but also non-functional in its current state. Further context or complete code is needed for a thorough assessment.",
