{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script for processing data, but without specific context, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments and environment variables; possibly file inputs or network sources are implied but not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs include console printing and possibly writing to files or network transmission if present; no explicit network calls are shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line inputs or environment variables through processing functions to outputs like print statements or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input parameters and environment variables, processes data using standard Python functions, and outputs results. No use of unsafe functions like exec or eval is observed. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration mechanisms, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose appears benign, but the lack of context limits full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It seems to be a benign utility script with standard operations.",
