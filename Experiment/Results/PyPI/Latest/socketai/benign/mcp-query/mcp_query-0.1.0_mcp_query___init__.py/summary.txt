  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's obfuscation and dynamic features justify its scores, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. The current scoring is appropriate; further static/dynamic analysis is recommended for Report 1 to confirm or refute malicious intent."
