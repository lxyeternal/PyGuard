{
  "purpose": "This script queries a Context7 MCP server to retrieve documentation or information about a specified library and topic.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (--library, --topic, --tokens, --verbose), subprocess call to 'npx' command, and the JSON formatted query string.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess's communicate method which sends data to an external process, and the print statements that output JSON results.",
  "flows": "User inputs are validated, formatted into a JSON query, sent via subprocess to an external server, and the response is parsed and outputted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'npx' with user-supplied arguments could be exploited if malicious inputs are provided, but the code properly validates input types and non-empty library names. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No unusual dynamic execution beyond subprocess call.",
  "analysis": "The code validates user inputs for 'library' and 'tokens', then constructs a JSON query string to invoke an external process via 'subprocess.Popen' with 'npx'. It captures output and errors, handles timeout and JSON parse exceptions, and outputs results in JSON format. The subprocess execution is a typical external process invocation with input/output streams. No suspicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is detected. The subprocess call to 'npx' may invoke external scripts, but this is standard for Node.js package execution, not inherently malicious. The overall code structure is straightforward and does not include hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign operation of querying an external server via 'npx' for documentation, with proper input validation and error handling. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The main security consideration is ensuring the external 'npx' command is not exploited via malicious inputs, but input validation mitigates this risk.",
