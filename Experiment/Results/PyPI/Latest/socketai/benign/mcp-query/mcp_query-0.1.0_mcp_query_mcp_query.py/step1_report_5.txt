{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to query a Context7 MCP server for documentation related to specified Python libraries and topics, then output the result in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Input data is gathered from command-line arguments (`--library`, `--topic`, `--tokens`, `--verbose`) and user-supplied arguments during execution. The code also receives data from the MCP server via subprocess communication.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess communicates with the MCP server via stdin and stdout, which are standard data channels. The output is printed to stdout, which could be a potential sink if untrusted data is handled improperly, but here it only outputs server responses after validation.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from command-line inputs into the `query_context7_mcp` function; data is formatted as JSON and sent via subprocess to the server. The server response is read from stdout, parsed, and outputted after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of `npx` to run an external package is standard for node-based tools. Error handling is typical; no malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles user input validation and subprocess management. No code injection, credential theft, or data exfiltration appears to be present. The subprocess communication is limited to a predefined command and data format. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent detected. The code’s structure and behavior are consistent with a legitimate documentation query tool.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for querying documentation from a server, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
