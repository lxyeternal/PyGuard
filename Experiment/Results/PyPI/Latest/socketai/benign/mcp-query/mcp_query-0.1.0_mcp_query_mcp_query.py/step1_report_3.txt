{
  "purpose": "The script queries a remote Context7 MCP server for documentation related to specified Python libraries and topics, using subprocess to run an external command.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--library, --topic, --tokens, --verbose), user inputs, and subprocess output.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess communicates with the external server; the script outputs JSON results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> query_context7_mcp() -> subprocess.Popen -> communicate() -> json.loads(stdout) -> output or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, no suspicious external network connections beyond the intended subprocess call, and no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Use of subprocess with user-provided parameters is standard but should be noted for command injection risk if parameters are not sanitized.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a command-line tool to query an external server via 'npx' and subprocess. Inputs are command-line args, sanitized minimally through basic checks. The subprocess call uses user inputs directly as arguments to 'npx', but these are part of a known command and not executed as shell commands (no shell=True). The code handles subprocess exceptions and JSON parsing errors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware activities are present. The subprocess invocation is a standard way to run external commands and does not pose a significant security risk in this context, provided inputs are validated, which they are. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward tool for querying documentation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard command-line interface for querying an external documentation server, with appropriate input validation and error handling. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
