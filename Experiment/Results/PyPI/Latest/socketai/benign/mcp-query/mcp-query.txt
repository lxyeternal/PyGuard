      "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for querying documentation via an external Node.js package. It includes basic input validation and standard subprocess handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the external dependency, which is acknowledged but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the supply chain risk. Overall, the code is safe for use with minimal security concerns beyond dependency trust."

      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's obfuscation and dynamic features justify its scores, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. The current scoring is appropriate; further static/dynamic analysis is recommended for Report 1 to confirm or refute malicious intent."
