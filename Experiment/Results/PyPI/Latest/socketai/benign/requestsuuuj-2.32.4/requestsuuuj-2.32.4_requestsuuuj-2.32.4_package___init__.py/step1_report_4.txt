  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Any input functions (e.g., input(), environment variables, or external data reads). No explicit sources identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or file writes, but none are explicitly present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources (if any) to output or processing functions, but no explicit source-to-sink paths are evident in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard Python syntax with no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. No unusual language features or suspicious variable naming. Lack of comments or context limits full understanding, but there are no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
