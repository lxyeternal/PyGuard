  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, input files, and network communication points.",
  "sinks": "Data transmission via HTTP POST, environment variables, and input files which could leak data if malicious.",
  "flows": "Input sources (files/env vars) to network transmission or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows detected; external communication is typical but warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. External communication is standard but could be risky if endpoints are malicious. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The security risk is low, and confidence is high due to the lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no malicious behavior or obfuscation. External communication is typical but should be monitored. Overall, the code is benign with a very low security risk.",
