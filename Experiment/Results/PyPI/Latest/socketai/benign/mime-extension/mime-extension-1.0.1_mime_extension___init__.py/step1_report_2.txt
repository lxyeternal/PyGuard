  "purpose": "This source code appears to implement a basic utility or module, but without explicit comments or documentation, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data sources via imports. Specific input sources are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or environment variable modifications, but none are explicitly identified in the code fragment provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or function parameters towards processing functions, with no clear data leakage or malicious output identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are apparent. The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any overt malicious indicators such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It employs typical programming constructs without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are visible. The absence of network activity or system tampering suggests it is benign. However, due to the limited snippet, some assumptions about the context are made.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The code appears to be a standard, benign module with no embedded malware or security risks detected.",
