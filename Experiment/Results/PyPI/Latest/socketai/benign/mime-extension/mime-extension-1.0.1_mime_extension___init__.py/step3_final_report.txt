{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python application with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard input, environment variables, and performs standard library operations without suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through routine processing functions without reaching any malicious sinks or executing suspicious code paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries for typical application logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9). The absence of suspicious patterns justifies a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe dependency.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
