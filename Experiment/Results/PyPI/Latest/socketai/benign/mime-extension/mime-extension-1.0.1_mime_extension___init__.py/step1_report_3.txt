  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and run a Python application, possibly related to network or system operations, but the specific purpose is not clearly defined.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, imported modules, and potentially user input or external data sources if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls, depending on the actual operations performed within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input to sinks like network or file operations, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls were detected. The code uses standard Python features and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed comprehensively, including its structure and content. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity were identified. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments were found. The code appears to perform typical application logic, with standard library usage and no signs of sabotage or malware. Due to the absence of suspicious elements, the overall risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign application with no indicators of supply chain compromise.",
