  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools and distutils.core.\n- It reads 'README.md' without exception handling, but this is common practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, and entry points are typical for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- Notes the unguarded `open('README.md').read()` as a minor risk but not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0. It is a straightforward setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup procedures.\n- Also notes the lack of error handling for reading 'README.md' but considers it non-malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the safe reading of 'README.md' and static metadata.\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusions: standard setup, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- No dynamic or external untrusted input processing.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is the unhandled file read, which is common in setup scripts and not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. All reports are consistent, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated code are present.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus across all reports.",
