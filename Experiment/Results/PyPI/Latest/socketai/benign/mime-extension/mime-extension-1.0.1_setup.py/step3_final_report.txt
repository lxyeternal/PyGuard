  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'mime-extension' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file directly; package metadata and dependencies defined in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file output beyond reading 'README.md'.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'README.md'; sink: passing data to 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "Unprotected 'open' call without exception handling; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports standard modules, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' without error handling, which is common but could cause runtime errors if the file is missing. No dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on the benign nature of this script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its safety. The unguarded file read is a minor issue but not malicious. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
