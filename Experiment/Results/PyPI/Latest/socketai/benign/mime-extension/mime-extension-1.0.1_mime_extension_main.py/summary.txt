  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward MIME extension lookup utility operating on trusted system files. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the minor caveat that the namespace removal regex could be optimized. No changes to the scores or assessment are necessary."
