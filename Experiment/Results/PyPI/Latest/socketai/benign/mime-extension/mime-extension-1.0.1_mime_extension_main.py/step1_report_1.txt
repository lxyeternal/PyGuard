{
  "purpose": "The script loads MIME type extensions from system files and allows listing MIME types or extensions based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads files from '/usr/share/mime' directory, reads file data with Path.open(), reads command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print statements, uses sys.argv for input parameters.",
  "flows": "Loads system files, processes XML content with lxml, retrieves glob elements, and outputs MIME types or extensions based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to manipulate XML tags; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious file access patterns beyond standard system file reading. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs system file parsing to extract MIME extension mappings. It reads files from a system directory, parses XML data with lxml, and outputs MIME types or extensions based on command-line arguments. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The code appears to perform legitimate file parsing functions with standard libraries and well-understood patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a MIME type extension lookup utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It reads system files, processes XML data, and outputs information. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present.",
