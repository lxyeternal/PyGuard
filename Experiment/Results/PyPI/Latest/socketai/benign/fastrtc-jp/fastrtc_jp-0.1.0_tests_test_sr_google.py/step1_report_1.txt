{
  "purpose": "The code performs speech recognition tasks using Google Speech-to-Text API and text-to-speech conversion with GTTS, processing WAV audio files and converting text to speech.",
  "sources": "Reading WAV files from specified file paths and resource files, and initializing external libraries for speech processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs speech recognition results to console, no data is written to untrusted locations or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Reads audio data from WAV files (sources), processes with speech recognition and TTS modules, and prints results to console (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on external resources and modules but does not perform suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The script loads audio files, processes them using speech recognition and TTS modules, and outputs results. No handling of untrusted input beyond reading static files. No network transmissions, credential management, or data leaks are evident. Usage of resources and third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only potential concern is external resource access, which is typical for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate speech recognition and synthesis tasks without evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external modules and static resource files, with no suspicious activities detected.",
