{
  "purpose": "The code performs testing of speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities using local audio files and external modules.",
  "sources": "Reads local WAV files and resource files for audio input; imports external modules for speech processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs recognition results to the console; no data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Reads audio data from files -> processes with speech modules -> outputs text results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static audio files, processes them with well-known speech recognition and TTS libraries, and prints results. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious behaviors are present. External dependencies are standard, and the code structure is straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite for speech functionalities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
