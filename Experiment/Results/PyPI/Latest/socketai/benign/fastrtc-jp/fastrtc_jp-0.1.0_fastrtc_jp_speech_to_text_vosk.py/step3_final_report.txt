  "purpose": "Implement a Vosk-based speech-to-text class that processes audio data, converts stereo to mono, and recognizes speech.",
  "sources": "Tuple input of sample rate and stereo audio numpy array",
  "sinks": "Print statements for debugging and recognition output",
  "flows": "Input tuple -> extract first channel -> convert to bytes -> recognize speech with Vosk -> parse JSON -> print recognized text",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data transmission; debug print statements present but benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a local speech recognition class using Vosk. It processes stereo audio, converts to mono, and recognizes speech without network activity or secrets. The print statements are for debugging and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high risk score in one report (0.9) is unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the actual low threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Vosk speech-to-text class with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to debug print statements, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
