{
  "purpose": "Implementing a speech-to-text class using the Vosk library for transcribing audio data.",
  "sources": "Reading audio data through the 'stt' method parameter 'audiodata', and potentially from the 'vosk' library during model initialization and recognition.",
  "sinks": "The code prints information and recognition results to standard output; no data is sent over network or stored elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Audio data is received from 'audiodata' -> processed into bytes -> passed to 'vosk.KaldiRecognizer' -> recognition result parsed from JSON -> outputted as text.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The model is loaded with a fixed model name. No external data or credentials are embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'VoskSTT' that initializes a Vosk speech recognition model with a fixed model name. The 'stt' method accepts audio data as a tuple of sample rate and numpy array, extracts the first channel, converts it into bytes, and uses Vosk to recognize speech. The recognition result is parsed from JSON and printed. There are no hidden or malicious operations, backdoors, or network activity. The print statements are only for debugging or informational purposes. All operations are standard for speech recognition processing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of speech-to-text functionality using the Vosk library, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It processes audio data locally and outputs recognition results. No security risks or malware signals are evident.",
