{
  "purpose": "Implement a speech-to-text class using the vosk library with specific model initialization and audio processing.",
  "sources": "Read audio data from the 'audiodata' parameter, which includes sample rate and audio array.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks or sensitive info processing identified.",
  "flows": "Audio data is processed into binary form and passed to vosk's recognizer, then the result is parsed from JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. No unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Vosk speech recognition model and processes audio input by converting the stereo audio into mono, then into bytes for recognition. It logs received audio parameters and recognized text. The only external interaction is through the vosk library, which is a legitimate speech recognition toolkit. No hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The print statements are for debugging and do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a speech-to-text feature with no malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond normal operation. It is safe based on the provided code.",
