{
  "purpose": "Implement a speech-to-text (STT) service using Vosk library integrated with a base class.",
  "sources": "Reads audio data tuple (sample rate and numpy array), and reads model data from the Vosk library initialization.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting received audio info and transcribed text; no external data transmission or storage observed.",
  "flows": "Audio data is processed into bytes, passed to Vosk recognizer, and final result is parsed from JSON; no untrusted data flows outside this process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code relies on external model files managed by the Vosk library; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Vosk speech recognition model, processes audio input (including printing audio info), performs recognition, and outputs the recognized text. It uses standard library functions, and no suspicious data handling or malicious code is apparent. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The print statements are benign debug outputs. Overall, the code performs expected functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a speech-to-text model using Vosk. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are detected. It maintains standard security practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
