  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Vosk speech-to-text class with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to debug print statements, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
