  "purpose": "Functions for removing markdown code blocks and splitting text into speech segments.",
  "sources": "Input string 'markdown_text' and 'text' parameter in split_to_talk_segments",
  "sinks": "None; the code operates solely on input strings without external data or network interactions",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through regex substitutions and string slicing to produce segments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard regex and string operations without obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward markdown processing: removing code blocks with regex and splitting text into segments based on line breaks and punctuation. It handles code blocks delimited by ``` and adjusts the first segment's punctuation. No external data flows, network activity, or file I/O are involved. The regex pattern is simple and correctly matches code blocks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The functions are safe, standard utilities for text processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard markdown text processing without any malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments of malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
