{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing markdown text by removing code blocks and splitting text into segments suitable for speech synthesis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via function parameters (`markdown_text`, `text`), uses string methods (`find`), and regular expressions (`re.search`, `re.sub`).",
  "sinks": "The functions generate processed text segments; there are no direct untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input text is received, code blocks are removed or replaced, and text is split into segments for speech synthesis, with no evident data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Functions perform straightforward string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script uses regex for detecting code blocks delimited by triple backticks and replaces them with newlines. It then splits input text into segments based on newlines and code block boundaries, with special handling for the first segment to shorten it at punctuation. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is present. The code appears to serve text processing purposes only, with safe and transparent operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for text processing with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard string operations and regex matches to prepare text for speech synthesis. No malicious behavior detected.",
