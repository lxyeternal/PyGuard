{
  "purpose": "The code processes markdown text by removing code blocks and splitting text into segments suitable for speech synthesis, with special handling of the first line.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'markdown_text' in remove_code_blocksRE and the 'text' parameter in split_to_talk_segments, which are user-provided or external strings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within local variables, with no external data flows or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs regex-based string manipulations and string splitting; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform regex-based removal of markdown code blocks and segment text for speech synthesis, including specific handling of the first line. The code uses standard string operations and regex without any suspicious patterns, external calls, or data leaks. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. The functions seem purely for text processing purposes, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward text processing utility with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It does not include network activity, data theft, or obfuscated malicious code.",
