  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code performs straightforward text processing: removing markdown code blocks and splitting text into segments for speech synthesis.\n- All reports agree that the functions are standard, using regex and string operations.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or file I/O are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code does not execute dynamic code, nor does it contain any backdoors or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues and Logic:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code as per the reports. The functions behave as intended for their purpose.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. The malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; all code is straightforward.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Security Risk / Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:\n\n- The reports are consistent; no unreasonable scores are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), justified by the clear, straightforward code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The code is purely for text processing, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The regex and string manipulations are standard and safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code appears robust for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                       | No malicious activity or payloads present.                          |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                       | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                    |\n| Security Risk  | 0                       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or insecure operations.           |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's actual behavior.",
