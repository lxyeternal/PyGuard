{
  "purpose": "Implements a Python client for Voicevox TTS server, supporting async and sync streaming, handling network requests, wave data processing, and dynamic URL resolution.",
  "sources": "Network requests to /audio_query and /synthesis endpoints, input text, external URL resolution via get_availavle_url, wave file reading from server response.",
  "sinks": "Network responses, wave data buffer, console logs for errors, audio data returned as float32 numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Input text -> get URL -> send audio_query request -> adjust parameters -> send synthesis request -> process wave data -> output audio array; streaming segments processed similarly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of asyncio.run() within class methods, which can cause nested event loop issues in some environments; minimal error handling with print statements; external URL resolution function not detailed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard TTS client operations with network requests, wave processing, and async streaming. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of asyncio.run() inside class methods is unconventional and may cause runtime issues but is not malicious. External URL fetching appears benign. Error handling is minimal but not suspicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and aligns with typical API client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Voicevox TTS client with no malicious behavior or security risks. Minor design considerations exist but do not impact security. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
