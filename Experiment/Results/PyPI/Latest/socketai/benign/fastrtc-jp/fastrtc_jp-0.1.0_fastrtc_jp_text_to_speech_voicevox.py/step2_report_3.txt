  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, the code matches the description; it interfaces with Voicevox server, handles network requests, processes wave data, and offers async/sync methods.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Use of `asyncio.run()` inside class methods can cause nested event loop issues if called within an existing event loop. This is a known problem but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable, considering the code communicates with external servers but no evident malicious activity.\n\n- **Logic/Reasoning:**  \n  The report correctly notes the absence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It recognizes potential runtime issues with `asyncio.run()` but no malicious implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, the code appears standard for a TTS API client.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, `asyncio.run()` usage is atypical but not malicious. Error handling is minimal (printing exceptions), but that’s a code quality concern, not security.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with no malicious behavior.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — justified due to external network calls.\n\n- **Logic/Reasoning:**  \n  The report correctly dismisses malicious behavior, focusing on the code's legitimate API interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, standard API client pattern.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Same as above regarding `asyncio.run()`. The external function `get_availavle_url()` is not detailed but assumed benign.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious activity.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Logic/Reasoning:**  \n  Valid, no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, straightforward API client.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Same note on `asyncio.run()`. No malicious code detected.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — slightly lower, reflecting minimal external interaction.\n\n- **Logic/Reasoning:**  \n  Correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, standard TTS client.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No malicious or obfuscated code. External URL fetching via `get_availavle_url()` is typical.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — justified due to external communication.\n\n- **Logic/Reasoning:**  \n  Correctly dismisses malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal external communication and no malicious intent.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (consistent with external API interaction but no malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a Voicevox TTS client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minor concerns about `asyncio.run()` usage are well-understood limitations, not indicators of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, with perhaps a note to improve error handling practices rather than concern over security.",
