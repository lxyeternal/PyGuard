{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for text-to-speech synthesis using the Voicevox API, including asynchronous and synchronous streaming functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided text, environment variables for URL configuration, and network responses from the Voicevox server.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the Voicevox server, JSON data processing, and wave audio data conversion serve as sinks where untrusted data could potentially cause issues if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into the voicevox_api function through network requests; responses are processed and converted into audio data, which is then returned or streamed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs or obfuscated elements. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets. It uses standard libraries and practices for network communication and audio processing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard network requests to communicate with a Voicevox server, adjusting synthesis parameters based on JSON responses, and converting wave data into numpy arrays. It includes proper error handling and uses asynchronous operations appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident. The get_availavle_url function's implementation is not provided, but its use suggests dynamic URL resolution without hardcoded addresses. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate TTS interface with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It employs common patterns for asynchronous network communication, audio data handling, and stream management without suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
