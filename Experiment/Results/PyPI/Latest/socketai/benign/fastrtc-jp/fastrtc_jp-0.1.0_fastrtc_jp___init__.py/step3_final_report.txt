  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable reads, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious variable names, and untrusted input handling.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign or absent code, with low malware and security risk scores. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising concern. The malware score of 0.3 is somewhat high given no confirmed malicious activity; adjusting it to 0.2 better reflects the suspicion level. Obfuscation score of 0.7 and security risk of 0.4 are justified. Confidence levels align with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent and cautious, with minor adjustments to better calibrate risk scores for Report 5.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign code or lack of code, with Report 5 indicating moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Adjusting the malware score in Report 5 from 0.3 to 0.2 provides a more accurate risk representation without overestimating malicious intent.",
