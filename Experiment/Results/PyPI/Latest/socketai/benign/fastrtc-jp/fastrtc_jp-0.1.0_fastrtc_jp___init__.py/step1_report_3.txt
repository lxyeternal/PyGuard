{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility or library module designed to perform specific functions, possibly related to data processing or system interaction. No clear purpose indicating malicious intent is immediately evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not read from external inputs, files, or network sockets directly.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted commands are present; no calls to subprocesses, network transmissions, or file writes with untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no observable source-to-sink data flows, as no untrusted data sources or sinks are utilized within the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual variable naming. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear structure and standard library usage. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious external calls, environment variable misuse, or data leaks are present. The lack of external input handling and network activity suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no indicators of malware or malicious supply chain activity.",
