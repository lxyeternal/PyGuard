{
  "purpose": "Implement a speech-to-text class using Google's speech recognition API with support for multiple languages.",
  "sources": "Reads audio data input (tuple of sample rate and audio array), uses speech_recognition library to process data.",
  "sinks": "Sends audio data to Google's speech recognition API via the recognize_google method, potentially exposing audio data.",
  "flows": "Audio data (source) is processed into sr.AudioData object, then passed to recognize_google (sink) for recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a speech recognizer and processes audio input by converting it to the appropriate format. It then attempts recognition using Google's API, cycling through languages on failure. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious activity are apparent. The use of external API could raise privacy concerns but is typical for speech recognition tasks. The code appears straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for this functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a speech recognition class leveraging Google's API. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The only notable aspect is that it sends audio data to an external service, which is typical for such applications but should be used with privacy considerations in mind.",
