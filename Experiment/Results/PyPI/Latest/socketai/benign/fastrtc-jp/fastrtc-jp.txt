      "conclusion": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign code or lack of code, with Report 5 indicating moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Adjusting the malware score in Report 5 from 0.3 to 0.2 provides a more accurate risk representation without overestimating malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign URL health check utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Minor improvements include correcting the typo in the function name and possibly adding URL validation for enhanced security, but these are not critical. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Vosk speech-to-text class with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to debug print statements, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."

The only notable aspect is the transmission of audio data to external servers, which is expected for this functionality and should be considered in privacy/security policies but does not constitute a security risk or malware."
