  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their assessments with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple asynchronous URL checker: it takes a list of host URLs, attempts to connect via HTTP GET, and returns the first URL that responds with status code 200 or 404.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (`httpx`, `numpy`) and performs straightforward network requests.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The purpose appears to be server availability checking, typical in load balancing or health check routines.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The function name `get_availavle_url` contains a typo (\"availavle\" instead of \"available\"). This is a minor issue and does not impact security or functionality significantly.\n- No other issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are apparent.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- The code is logically sound for its purpose.\n- Exception handling is appropriate for network errors.\n- The code returns early upon finding a responsive URL, which is expected behavior.\n- No security flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n| Report | Purpose | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Confidence | Reasoning |\n|---------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------|-----------|\n| 1 | Low risk, URL health check | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0.9 | No malicious activity; standard network check |\n| 2 | Same as above | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | 0.9 | No malicious activity; standard network check |\n| 3 | Same as above | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0.9 | No malicious activity; standard network check |\n| 4 | Same as above | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 1.0 | No malicious activity; standard network check |\n| 5 | Same as above | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0.9 | No malicious activity; standard network check |\n\nAll reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent.\n\nThe security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal risk of network request-based URL validation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No issues warranting a high risk score are present.\n- The code performs benign network checks.\n- No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is assumed based on the code.\n- The only minor concern is the typo in the function name, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard URL health check)\n\n**My reasoning:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- The network requests are standard and controlled.\n- No data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The minor typo does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate | Justification |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0                | No malicious activity observed |\n| Obfuscated   | 0                | Clear, straightforward code |\n| Risk         | 0.1              | Minimal risk, standard URL health check |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their low-risk assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
