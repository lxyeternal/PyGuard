{
  "purpose": "Provides text-to-speech synthesis using gTTS, decodes MP3 data to PCM, and streams audio segments with audio processing functions.",
  "sources": "Reads text input for TTS, MP3 data from gTTS output, and audio frames from av container decoding.",
  "sinks": "Outputs PCM audio data, streams audio segments asynchronously, and yields processed audio data.",
  "flows": "Text input -> gTTS generates MP3 -> MP3 bytes read into BytesIO -> av decodes MP3 to audio frames -> numpy array processed with librosa -> PCM data returned or streamed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of 'asyncio.new_event_loop()' in a blocking method is unconventional but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard TTS and audio processing using well-known libraries. MP3 decoding via av and librosa effects are typical. The event loop creation in 'stream_tts_sync' is inefficient but not malicious. No external data leaks, no credential handling, and no obfuscation are present. The data flows are within memory, and external services are only used for speech synthesis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of TTS with audio processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The minor inefficiency in event loop handling does not pose security risks.",
