{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package, serving as a placeholder with static metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call with hardcoded package metadata fields (name, version, author, description).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – static code with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, environment variables, network activity, or obfuscated patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed, placeholder metadata. No dynamic or external data is used. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is a typical, static package configuration script, explicitly labeled as a placeholder. All signals indicate benign intent, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and the explicit placeholder description support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script serving as a placeholder. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
