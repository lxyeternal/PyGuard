  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of tautomer enumeration using RDKit.\n- No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code is identified.\n- The code relies on standard open-source cheminformatics libraries and local modules for data structures.\n- No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The logic is simple, transparent, and consistent with normal molecular processing workflows.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The only notable discrepancy is in the *securityRisk* score of the first report, which is 0.1, whereas others assign 0.0.\n- The *malware* scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The *obfuscated* scores are all 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The *malware* score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The *obfuscated* score of 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- The *securityRisk* scores are mostly 0, with the first report at 0.1. Given the analysis, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted unless there's a specific security concern, which there isn't.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The minor difference in the *securityRisk* score in the first report is likely an overestimation; I would set it to 0.0 for consistency.\n- The *malware* score remains at 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The *obfuscated* score remains at 0, as the code is transparent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I would assign the following scores based on the review:\n  - *malware*: 0\n  - *obfuscated*: 0\n  - *securityRisk*: 0\n\n**Overall assessment:**\nThis code is a standard, benign utility for tautomer enumeration with no security concerns.",
