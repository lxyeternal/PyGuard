  "purpose": "Enumerates tautomers of a molecule using RDKit's TautomerEnumerator, returning a library of unique tautomers with optional renaming and deduplication.",
  "sources": "Reads input molecule data from mol.rdmol; uses RDKit's TautomerEnumerator for enumeration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Source: mol.rdmol -> TautomerEnumerator. Sink: list of enumerated tautomers processed into MolLibr.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard RDKit functions to enumerate tautomers and processes the results into custom data structures. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The logic is straightforward, with no external data leaks or network activity. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple expert reviews, with all assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's transparency and standard library usage further support its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for tautomer enumeration, with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard cheminformatics libraries appropriately, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
