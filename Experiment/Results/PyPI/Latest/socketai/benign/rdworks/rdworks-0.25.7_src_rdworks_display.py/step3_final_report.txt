  "purpose": "Utility functions for molecular depiction, visualization (SVG, PNG), scaling, and rotation using RDKit and PIL.",
  "sources": "Input molecule objects provided to functions; no external data sources or user inputs processed within the code.",
  "sinks": "Generated SVG strings and PIL Image objects; no external data transmission or file I/O beyond image cropping.",
  "flows": "Functions process input molecules to produce visual or transformed outputs internally; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cheminformatics libraries (RDKit, PIL, NumPy) for visualization and geometric transformations. It performs in-memory operations on molecule objects, with no external communication or system modifications. The molecule rotation modifies conformers in-place, which is typical in such utilities. Minor code quality note: usage of np.float is deprecated but not security-related. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concern primarily due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is safe.",
