{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing, manipulating, and transforming molecular structures using RDKit, including generating SVG and PNG images, scaling, and rotating molecules.",
  "sources": "Input molecules (`rdmol`) are provided to various functions; there are no external data inputs or user inputs read directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "Generated SVG and PNG images are returned; no data is sent externally or stored outside function scope. No network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration code present.",
  "flows": "Input molecules flow through depiction and transformation functions, resulting in image outputs. There are no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. Use of standard RDKit and image processing libraries appears legitimate. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes well-known libraries (RDKit, PIL, NumPy) for chemical visualization and transformations. Functions for depiction, highlighting, scaling, and rotating molecules are implemented straightforwardly. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or system compromise. The code’s structure and comments suggest legitimate use for chemical visualization tasks. There are no suspicious code patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard molecular visualization and manipulation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate operations related to chemical structure depiction and transformation. No malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
