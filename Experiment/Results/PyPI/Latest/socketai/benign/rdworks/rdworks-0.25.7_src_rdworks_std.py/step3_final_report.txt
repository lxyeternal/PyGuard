{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for desalting, standardizing, and neutralizing SMILES strings using RDKit, aimed at chemical data normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads input SMILES strings, splits on '.', and processes molecules via RDKit functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input SMILES -> RDKit molecule processing functions -> output molecules or strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Broad try-except in desalt_smiles masks errors but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard RDKit functions for molecule standardization and neutralization. No external communication or malicious patterns are evident. Exception handling is broad but typical for data parsing. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The functions serve legitimate cheminformatics purposes with no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe cheminformatics utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The broad exception handling in desalt_smiles does not constitute malicious behavior but could be refined for error transparency. Overall, the code is clean, standard, and secure.",
