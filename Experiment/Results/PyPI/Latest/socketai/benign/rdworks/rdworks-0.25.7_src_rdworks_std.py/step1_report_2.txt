{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for processing and standardizing SMILES strings and molecules using RDKit, including desalting, standardization, normalization, and neutralization.",
  "sources": "Reads input SMILES strings in functions like desalt_smiles, standardize_smiles, standardize, and neutralize_atoms.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed SMILES strings or RDKit molecule objects; no direct data sinks for untrusted data or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input SMILES -> parsing and processing functions -> standardized or neutralized molecules or SMILES outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of try-except without handling specific exceptions, but benign in this context. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily utilizes RDKit for chemical data processing. It reads input SMILES strings, performs operations like desalting, standardization, normalization, and neutralization. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling observed. Use of generic try-except blocks in desalt_smiles could mask errors but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. The functions perform chemical standardization tasks with proper use of RDKit API, and no evidence of malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate chemical data processing toolkit utilizing RDKit. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signatures are detected. It is focused on standardization and neutralization of molecules, with safe data handling. No indications of security risks or backdoors present.",
