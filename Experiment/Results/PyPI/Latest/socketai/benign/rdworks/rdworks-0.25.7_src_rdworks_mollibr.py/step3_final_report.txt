{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive cheminformatics library class ('MolLibr') for managing, filtering, clustering, and exporting molecular data, including support for parallel processing and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input molecules from various formats (Mol, SMILES, Chem.Mol), external configuration files, and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to SDF, SMILES, PNG, CSV, HTML files, and directories; no network or external command execution involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows through molecule parsing, processing, clustering, filtering, and exporting functions. No untrusted external data or network interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of multiprocessing and file I/O is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, feature-rich cheminformatics utility leveraging standard libraries. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or external vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward, with typical data processing and export routines. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The security-related signals (malware score, obfuscation score, risk score) are all consistent with a benign, standard application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, and standard cheminformatics library component with no malicious or security concerns. It is suitable for supply chain deployment without risk of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
