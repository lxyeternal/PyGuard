  "purpose": "This module provides functions to break a molecule into scaffolds, including Murcko scaffolds, BRICS fragmentation, and recursive scaffold analysis to generate scaffold trees and networks.",
  "sources": "RDKit functions such as substructure matching, bond and atom removal, SMILES conversions, and molecule sanitization.",
  "sinks": "Internal molecule modifications; no external data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input molecule -> substructure matches and bond/atom removals -> recursive fragmentation -> scaffold extraction and network/tree construction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; broad try-except blocks mask errors but are standard in cheminformatics.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RDKit-based molecule processing for scaffold and fragment analysis. It manipulates molecules via substructure matching, bond removal, and sanitization, with recursive functions to generate scaffold trees and networks. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Error handling masks issues but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions rely solely on RDKit operations, which are safe and well-understood. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate chemoinformatics workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard RDKit-based molecule fragmentation toolkit with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The recursive fragmentation and scaffold extraction functions are typical for chemoinformatics applications. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscated score is zero. The overall assessment indicates the code is safe for use in open-source chemoinformatics projects.",
