  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard RDKit-based molecule fragmentation toolkit with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The recursive fragmentation and scaffold extraction functions are typical for chemoinformatics applications. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscated score is zero. The overall assessment indicates the code is safe for use in open-source chemoinformatics projects."
