{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for breaking molecules into scaffolds, including scaffold extraction, fragmentation, and analysis based on chemical structures.",
  "sources": "Inputs include molecules from rdkit.Chem.Mol objects, SMARTS patterns for substructure matching, and external functions such as desalt_smiles for string processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve molecule modification functions (e.g., Chem.RemoveAtoms, Chem.RWMol operations), substructure replacements, and SMILES conversions. No external network communication or data exfiltration is present.",
  "flows": "Input molecules are processed through substructure matching and atom/bond manipulation functions. Data flows from molecule input -> substructure matching -> molecule fragmentation/removal -> molecule sanitization -> output list of molecules.",
  "anomalies": "The code extensively manipulates molecular structures without any apparent external data collection, network activity, or hidden code. Usage of try-except blocks suppresses errors silently, but this is typical in chemical informatics workflows. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily employs RDKit functions for molecule fragmentation, scaffold extraction, and structural analysis. It uses standard RDKit operations such as GetSubstructMatches, FragmentOnBonds, RemoveAtoms, and SMILES conversions. The functions are designed for chemical structure processing and do not include network calls, system modifications, or data leaks. Error handling is used to avoid crashes but does not hide malicious intent. No obfuscated code, hidden scripts, or suspicious external dependencies are evident. All operations relate to chemical data processing, and there are no signals indicating malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate chemical informatics utility module focused on scaffold analysis and fragmentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions perform standard operations on molecular data, and there are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or covert activities.",
