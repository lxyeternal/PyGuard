{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to decompose molecules, connect core and R-groups, and expand R-groups into multiple molecules, primarily for chemical structure manipulation and molecule generation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include external molecule SMILES strings (combi_smiles, core, R-groups), user input (through function arguments), and internal molecule processing functions. Data is read when parsing SMILES strings, atom properties, and bonds.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include molecule creation and modification functions such as Chem.MolFromSmiles, AllChem.ReplaceSubstructs, Chem.RemoveHs, Chem.DeleteSubstructs, EditableMol.AddBond, and Mol object creation. These could lead to code injection if untrusted input manipulates SMILES strings or atom properties.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (SMILES strings) flow from input arguments into molecule parsing functions, then through processing functions (e.g., connect_core_and_chains), culminating in molecule generation or modification, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted. However, all manipulations are standard RDKit operations, and no external network or file I/O is performed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code are present. The code uses standard molecule processing functions. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are observed. The presence of parallel processing with ProcessPoolExecutor and tqdm for progress display is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard RDKit functions for molecule decomposition, connection, and expansion, all of which are deterministic and well-documented. No dynamic code execution (like eval or exec) is used. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behaviors (like network communication or system modification) are detected. The code mainly manipulates chemical structures based on input SMILES strings. All data flows are from sanitized inputs through known library functions, with no indication of malicious intent. The use of parallel processing and progress bars is benign in this context. There are no signs of covert data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate chemical data processing tool with no malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on user-provided SMILES strings and standard RDKit functions, with no suspicious network or system access. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
