  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**1. Purpose and Functionality:**\nAll reports agree that the code replaces '#' and '@' placeholders in a string with a provided frame number, optionally applying offsets and padding. The core logic involves regex matching and string substitution, which is straightforward.\n\n**2. Code Behavior & Security Aspects:**\n- The code performs string manipulation using regex, with no external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions are deterministic and confined to string processing.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n**3. Potential Flaws or Misinterpretations:**\n- The reports are consistent in their benign assessment.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n- The regex patterns are standard and do not appear obfuscated.\n- The code's logic is transparent and well-contained.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting clear understanding.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n**5. Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code only manipulates strings with regex, the likelihood of hidden malicious intent is negligible.\n- The optional offset parsing is straightforward and does not introduce security concerns.\n- The code could be extended or misused if integrated into larger systems, but as-is, it remains safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a simple, deterministic string formatting utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The regex patterns are standard, and the logic is transparent. There are no external data sinks, network activity, or system modifications involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The code appears safe for use in any context requiring placeholder replacement with frame numbers.",
