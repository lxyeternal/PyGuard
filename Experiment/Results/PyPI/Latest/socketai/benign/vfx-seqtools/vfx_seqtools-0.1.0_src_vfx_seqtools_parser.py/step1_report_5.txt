{
  "purpose": "The function replaces '#' and '@' characters in the input string with a specified frame number, optionally applying offsets and padding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input_string' (user-provided string), 'number' (frame number).",
  "sinks": "re.sub function calls for pattern matching and replacement, which process the input string.",
  "flows": "Pattern matches on '#' and '@' sequences, optional offsets, processed by regex groups, leading to replacement with calculated values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No use of network, file, or system command executions. The regex and replacement logic are straightforward, with no obfuscated or misleading code. No data leakage or insecure data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that performs pattern-based replacements in a string, substituting '#' and '@' characters with the frame number, possibly with offsets and zero-padding. The inner functions handle regex match objects to compute the replacement strings. The use of re.sub with defined functions ensures controlled and predictable behavior. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code operates solely on string manipulation and pattern matching, with no external side effects or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for string replacement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign helper function for formatting strings with frame numbers. There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation detected.",
