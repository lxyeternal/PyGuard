{
  "purpose": "The code replaces '#' and '@' characters in a string with a frame number, optionally applying offsets and padding based on pattern matches.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'input_string' from function arguments, possibly external strings passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function performs string replacements, but does not output or send data externally; no external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed with regex substitutions that replace patterns involving '#' and '@' with computed frame numbers, based on 'number' argument and optional offsets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns; code performs typical regex-based string formatting. No external network or system calls, and no code injection mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to match and replace patterns of '#' and '@' with a numerical frame number, applying optional offsets and padding. The pattern matching and replacement logic is straightforward and confined to string manipulation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious code injection. The use of regex is standard, and no suspicious or obfuscated constructs are present. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for string formatting based on frame numbers, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign string processing utility intended for replacing placeholders with frame numbers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe based on the provided content.",
