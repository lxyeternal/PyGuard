{
  "purpose": "The function replaces '#' and '@' characters in the input string with a specified frame number, optionally applying offsets and zero-padding based on patterns.",
  "sources": "Input parameters `input_string` and `number`, regex matches within the code.",
  "sinks": "The regex functions process the input string, but there are no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Patterns matching '#' or '@' with optional offsets are matched and transformed via `re.sub` calls, which invoke the internal functions to produce the final string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code performs straightforward string replacements with pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that modifies a string by replacing specific symbols with a frame number, optionally with offsets and zero-padding. It uses regex patterns to identify sequences of '#' or '@' with optional offsets. The functions `zero_padded_match` and `unpadded_match` calculate the replacement string based on the matched pattern. There are no external data sources, network calls, or environment variable accesses. The regex patterns and replacement logic are standard and do not appear obfuscated or malicious. Overall, the code seems to perform a benign string transformation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward string processing function intended for formatting purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No malicious signals are detected.",
