{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to replace placeholders '#' and '@' in an input string with a specified frame number, optionally applying offset and padding.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `input_string` (user-provided string), `number` (frame number).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only performs string manipulation and regex replacements with no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string with placeholders -> regex substitution functions -> replaced output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration present. Use of regex is standard for string replacements; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The function performs pattern matching and substitution to replace '#' and '@' placeholders with a given number, applying padding and offsets based on regex groups. The regex patterns and replacement functions are straightforward, with no external data, network calls, or insecure operations. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The code appears to be a utility for string formatting, common in scripting and templating contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard string formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply replaces placeholders with formatted frame numbers, handling optional offsets. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
