{
  "purpose": "The function replaces '#' and '@' characters in a string with a specified frame number, with optional offset adjustments.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter `input_string` read at function entry.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with external systems, files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed through regex replacements that generate output based on the `number` parameter; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex to parse and replace patterns but does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern matching and replacement in a straightforward manner, substituting '#' and '@' characters with the provided number, optionally applying offsets. The use of regex and string formatting appears normal. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected, and the logic is clear and standard for such string replacements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple string manipulation utility that replaces specific patterns with a given number and optional offsets. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
