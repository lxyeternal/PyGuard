{
  "purpose": "The code replaces '#' and '@' placeholders in a string with a specified frame number, supporting optional offsets and padding for '#' patterns.",
  "sources": "Input string containing '#' and '@' patterns, which are matched via regex.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a modified string; no external data sinks or network operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Regex matches '#' or '@' patterns -> calls respective replacement functions -> returns the modified string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward regex-based string replacement without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to identify '#' and '@' patterns with optional offsets. Replacement functions handle padding and offset calculations. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The logic is transparent and safe. The regex patterns are standard, and the code does not perform any obfuscation or malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code is suitable for use in any context requiring placeholder replacement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
