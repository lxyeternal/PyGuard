{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper that imports and executes the 'seqls' function, serving as a command-line interface entry point.",
  "sources": "Import of 'seqls' from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqls'; registration of CLI command via 'typer'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'seqls' when CLI command is invoked; no other data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "CLI invocation triggers 'app()', which calls the registered 'seqls' function; no internal data flow or processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that imports 'seqls' and registers it as a command with 'typer'. There are no internal security issues, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security and malware risk depend entirely on the implementation of 'seqls', which is external and not provided. The code itself is benign, with no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of internal issues. The overall assessment is that this code is safe and poses minimal security risk, assuming 'seqls' is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is negligible and consistent with the low malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security posture depends on the external 'seqls' implementation, but the wrapper itself is benign.",
