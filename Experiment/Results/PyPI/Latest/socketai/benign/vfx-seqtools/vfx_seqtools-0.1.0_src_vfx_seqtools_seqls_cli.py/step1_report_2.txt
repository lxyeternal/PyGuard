  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqls' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqls' module, used to run the 'seqls' command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the execution of 'seqls' function within the Typer app setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'seqls' command when the script runs; no other untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Typer app -> registration of 'seqls' command -> invocation in main block -> execution of 'seqls' command via Typer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'typer' library for CLI creation and the 'seqls' command from an internal module. It registers 'seqls' as a CLI command and runs the app if executed as main. There are no input sources like user input parsing, environment variable reads, or network calls; the core action is executing the imported 'seqls' function. The code structure appears straightforward, with standard usage of 'typer'. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI wrapper to invoke an external 'seqls' function. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident within this script. It appears safe, assuming 'seqls' itself is secure.",
