  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward CLI wrapper around an imported function `seqls`.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code is minimal, primarily importing `typer` and `seqls`, registering the command, and executing it.\n- The core concern is the behavior of `seqls`, which is an external function not provided here.\n- The reports uniformly assign very low security risk and malware scores (mostly 0), indicating no malicious activity detected in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is simple and appears correct.\n- **Malware presence:** No, the code itself does not contain malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, code is straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent in this wrapper; risk depends on `seqls`.\n- **Behavior of `seqls`:** Unknown; could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring considerations:\n- All reports give malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with a simple CLI wrapper.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n- Yes, given the code snippet alone, the scores are appropriate.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless `seqls` is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if `seqls` is known to be malicious, but based on this code alone, staying low is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the reports emphasize the lack of anomalies and suspicious patterns, no changes are necessary.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a benign CLI wrapper with no inherent security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (matches the reports; no increased risk evident)\n\n**However,** if there is external knowledge that `seqls` is malicious, the malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly. But based solely on this code, the current scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- The main security concern hinges on the behavior of `seqls`, which is outside this code snippet.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
