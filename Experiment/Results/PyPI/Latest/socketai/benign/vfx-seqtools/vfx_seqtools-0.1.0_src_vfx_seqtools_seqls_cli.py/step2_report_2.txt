  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around an imported function `seqls`.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The behavior of `seqls` itself is unknown, but the wrapper code appears benign.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious patterns in the wrapper code.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern based solely on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- The code **matches** the description: it imports `typer`, the `seqls` function, and registers a CLI command that calls `seqls`.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is a minimal, standard CLI wrapper.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that the security and malware risk depend on the external `seqls` implementation, which is outside this snippet's scope.\n\n### Score Evaluations\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. These seem reasonable, assuming `seqls` is safe.\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5; all are very low, which is justified given the benign nature of this wrapper code.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions\n- The reports correctly note that security concerns hinge on the external `seqls` function.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code is a simple wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or suggested.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, assuming the external function is safe.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal CLI wrapper with no internal logic that could introduce security issues. The risk and malware scores should remain very low unless the external `seqls` function is malicious, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed.\n- **Issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 (or similar very low value).\n- **Overall:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as low unless further information about `seqls` indicates otherwise. The code itself is safe.",
