  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports a function `seqls` from an internal module and registers it as a command using the `typer` library.\n- The main block runs the CLI app.\n- No input validation, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. They do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious code within this snippet.\n\n- **Is the code safe?**  \n  Based solely on this snippet, yes. The security risk is minimal, assuming the imported `seqls` function is also safe.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note that the behavior of `seqls` is unknown and that the security posture depends on that function.\n- No report claims the code is malicious or risky; they all assign very low malware and security risk scores.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nSince the code is purely a wrapper with no evident issues, a security risk score of **0.0** would be more appropriate than 0.1 or 0.2, unless there's context about the `seqls` function itself. But given only this snippet, zero is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The risk scores are very low, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- No higher scores are justified unless `seqls` is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n---\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- All reports assume that `seqls` is safe, which is reasonable given the code context.\n- No report claims any vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on this wrapper code.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (minimal security risk based on this code snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code itself does not exhibit any security issues.\n- The scores should reflect this, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at **0.0**.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis on the `seqls` function itself is required.",
