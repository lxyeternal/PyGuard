{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqls' functionality, providing a command-line interface to invoke 'seqls'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typer' and 'seqls' from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqls'. The script calls 'seqls' as a command via Typer.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'seqls' function which could be a command-line tool; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "User executes the script, which invokes 'seqls' through Typer's command line interface, but no data flow from untrusted sources is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' and a specific function 'seqls'. It creates a Typer app instance, registers 'seqls' as a command, and runs the app if executed directly. There are no input validation, data processing, or network operations visible. The code appears to serve as a simple CLI wrapper. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI interface wrapper for the 'seqls' function and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard pattern for exposing functions via command line.",
