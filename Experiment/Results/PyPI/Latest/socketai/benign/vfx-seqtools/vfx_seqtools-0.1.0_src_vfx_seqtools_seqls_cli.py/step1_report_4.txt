{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper that integrates the 'seqls' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqls' module into a command-line interface using the Typer library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typer' and 'seqls', and the command registration that binds 'seqls' to the CLI.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI -> 'app' executes -> 'seqls' function called; no data flows are evident within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a CLI framework and a function, then registers that function as a command for the CLI. The main execution block runs the CLI app. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code insertion. The imported 'seqls' function is external, and its behavior is unknown, but based on this code, it appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI interface for the 'seqls' function without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are evident from the provided code.",
