  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqls function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqls module",
  "sources": "Importing seqls function, reading command-line arguments via typer",
  "sinks": "Executing seqls when the CLI command is invoked",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI -> typer invokes seqls function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a command-line interface library (typer) and a function (seqls). It sets up a CLI command that calls the seqls function when executed. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources directly handled within this code snippet. The seqls function, which is imported, is a black box here; its behavior cannot be assessed without its code. The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. It does not perform any data processing or network operations directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts solely as a CLI wrapper around an imported function with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues within this snippet. Its security risk is very low, assuming seqls itself is safe. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
