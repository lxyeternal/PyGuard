  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqcp function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp module, providing command-line interface access.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'seqcp' from an external module; invocation of 'app.command()(seqcp)' which registers the function as a CLI command.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only registers an existing function as a CLI command.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward, serving as a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' for CLI handling and the 'seqcp' function from an external module. It registers 'seqcp' as a command in the Typer app and runs the app if executed as the main module. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper without any embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI interface setup for an existing function, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies entirely on the external 'seqcp' function, which is not analyzed here. Based solely on this code, there is no malicious behavior or security concern.",
