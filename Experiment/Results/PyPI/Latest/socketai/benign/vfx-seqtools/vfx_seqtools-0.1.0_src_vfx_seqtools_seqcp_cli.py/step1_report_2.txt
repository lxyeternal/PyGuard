  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface wrapper for the seqcp function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially importing 'seqcp' from an external module; execution entry point (__name__ == '__main__')",
  "sinks": "The code primarily calls an external function 'seqcp'; potential risks depend on that function's implementation, but not directly observable here.",
  "flows": "User runs the CLI, which triggers 'seqcp' function; no direct data flow or untrusted input handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The script acts as a simple CLI wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typer' to create a command-line interface and wraps the 'seqcp' function as a command. It sets up the CLI app and executes it if run as the main program. No internal logic or data processing is visible; the core functionality depends entirely on the imported 'seqcp'. Given the simplicity and standard pattern, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation within this code snippet. Any security concerns would depend on the implementation of 'seqcp' itself, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a CLI wrapper around an external 'seqcp' function. It does not contain malicious logic or suspicious behavior by itself. The security assessment of the entire package depends on the implementation of 'seqcp'.",
