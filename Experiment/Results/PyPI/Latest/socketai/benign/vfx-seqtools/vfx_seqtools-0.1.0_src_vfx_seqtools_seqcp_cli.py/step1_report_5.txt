  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqcp function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing seqcp from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp",
  "sinks": "Calling the seqcp function via CLI command",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI, which triggers app(), leading to execution of seqcp()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward CLI wrapper, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'typer' library to create a command-line interface. It imports a function 'seqcp' from a module within 'vfx_seqtools.actions'. The 'app' object is created using 'typer.Typer()', and the 'seqcp' function is registered as a command. When executed as the main program, it runs the CLI application. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The structure is simple and standard for CLI wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward CLI wrapper for the 'seqcp' command, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a benign interface to an existing function.",
