{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for the 'seqcp' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp' module, allowing users to execute it via command line.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the command line through the 'typer' library, which handles CLI commands and arguments.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the invocation of the 'seqcp' function, which may process user input. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs are passed through 'typer' to the 'seqcp' function, with the flow originating at the CLI input and flowing into the function call.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears straightforward and uses standard CLI wrapper patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'typer' library to create a CLI application. It imports the 'seqcp' function from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp' and registers it as a command. When run directly, it executes the CLI application. There is no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. The 'seqcp' function's internal behavior is unknown but is invoked with user-provided CLI input. Without the implementation details of 'seqcp', there is no indication of malicious activity within this wrapper code.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a CLI wrapper for another function without any apparent malicious intent. It does not contain hidden behaviors or malicious code within this snippet. The security risk is minimal; however, the safety depends on the security of the 'seqcp' function itself.",
