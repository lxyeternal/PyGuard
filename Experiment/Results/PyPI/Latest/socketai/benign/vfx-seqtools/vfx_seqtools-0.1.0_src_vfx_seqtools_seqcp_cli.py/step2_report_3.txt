  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports `typer` and the `seqcp` function from `vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp`.\n- Sets up a Typer CLI app.\n- Registers `seqcp` as a command.\n- Runs the app if executed as the main module.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard patterns for CLI wrappers.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The actual behavior and potential risks depend on the implementation of `seqcp`, which is external and not provided here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a benign CLI wrapper, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0` — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a simple wrapper, with security concerns depending on `seqcp`.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.2` — reasonable, considering the core logic is external.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — acceptable.\n- **Note:** The report emphasizes that risks depend on `seqcp`’s implementation, which is accurate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, correctly identifies the code as a straightforward CLI wrapper.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1` — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is a CLI wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.2` — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as a straightforward CLI wrapper.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0` — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple CLI wrapper.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting minimal security risk in the wrapper itself.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code is a minimal, standard CLI wrapper. No suspicious patterns, no embedded malicious code, and no obfuscation.\n- The security implications depend entirely on the external `seqcp` function, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect that the security risk depends on the external function, but the wrapper itself is benign)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is benign, and the reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.",
