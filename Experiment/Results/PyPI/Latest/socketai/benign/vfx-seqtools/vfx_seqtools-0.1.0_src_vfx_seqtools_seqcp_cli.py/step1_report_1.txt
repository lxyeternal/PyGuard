  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the seqcp function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp module, providing command-line access.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'typer' and 'seqcp' function from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'app()' in main, which runs the CLI command; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "User runs CLI, which triggers 'seqcp' via Typer command registration; no data flow outside command invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Typer-based CLI wrapper around the 'seqcp' function. It imports the necessary modules and registers 'seqcp' as a command. The main block executes the CLI application. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behavior. Usage of third-party libraries 'typer' and 'vfx_seqtools' is standard. No input/output handling is visible here besides the command-line interface. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign CLI wrapper script that registers an external function as a command-line command. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in this code.",
