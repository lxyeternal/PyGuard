  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scores, and validity of their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple CLI wrapper around an external function `seqcp`.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard libraries (`typer`).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- The core concern is whether invoking `seqcp` could introduce security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n- The code **does** indeed import and invoke `seqcp` via a CLI command.\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The actual security risk depends heavily on the implementation of `seqcp`, which is external and not provided here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code itself is benign and matches the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- No factual errors are evident; all reports correctly identify the code as a simple CLI wrapper.\n- Some reports assign very high confidence scores (1 or 0.9) and very low obfuscated/malware scores (0), which seem appropriate given the code.\n\n**Note:** The reports appropriately avoid over-claiming about the security of `seqcp` itself, focusing on the wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk based on this code alone.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the code's benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The overall risk depends on `seqcp`'s implementation, which is unknown here.\n- Since the wrapper itself is harmless, the risk should remain low unless `seqcp` is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- This is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- Any concern about `seqcp` being malicious cannot be assessed from this wrapper code alone.\n- The reports correctly acknowledge that the security of the overall system depends on `seqcp`.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- The high confidence scores align with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code snippet and reports, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to reliance on external function)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.\n- The security concern is entirely external, related to `seqcp`'s implementation, which is outside this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign and poses minimal security risk.\n- The overall security posture depends on the external `seqcp` function, not this wrapper.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No immediate security concerns from this code alone.
