  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqcp function, providing command-line interface access.",
  "sources": "Imports 'typer' library and the 'seqcp' function from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqcp'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'app()' which triggers the 'seqcp' command; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "User executes CLI, which invokes 'seqcp' via the Typer app command.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward wrapper with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard CLI wrapper around an external function 'seqcp'. It uses 'typer' for CLI setup, registers 'seqcp' as a command, and runs the app if executed directly. No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'seqcp', which is external and not provided. The code itself is benign and follows best practices for such wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the external 'seqcp' function. Based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
