  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information for CLI utilities related to VFX frame sequences.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import importlib.metadata -> Retrieve version with version(__package__) -> Assign to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of __package__ could be manipulated in unusual environments, but generally safe in standard packaging contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and assigns the current package's version to __version__, a common pattern for version management. It involves no external input, network activity, or data sinks. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of __package__ is typical, though in rare cases it could be manipulated, but this does not constitute a security concern in normal usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal potential concern about __package__ manipulation is theoretical and generally not problematic in standard deployment. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
