  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing `importlib.metadata` and retrieving the package version via `__package__`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for Python package version retrieval.\n- No external inputs, user data, or network activity are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of `__package__` is typical, though in some edge cases it could be manipulated, but this is unlikely in standard package usage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly retrieves the package version using `importlib.metadata.version(__package__)`. No issues here.\n- **Security implications:** No evidence of security risks, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware presence:** The reports indicate malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any flaws or mistakes in the code. Given the simplicity, this is accurate.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk ≈ 0, obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only retrieves package version info without any external inputs, outputs, or sensitive operations, the overall security risk remains at 0.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Potential edge cases:\n- The use of `__package__` could be problematic if the module is run in an unusual context, but this does not constitute a security risk in this scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard utility for version retrieval with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is benign and secure as described.",
