  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, only importing `importlib.metadata` and retrieving the package version via `__package__`.\n- No input from untrusted sources, no external data handling, no network or file I/O.\n- The use of `__package__` for version retrieval is standard, though it could theoretically be manipulated if the package context is altered, but in normal operation, this is safe.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- The code correctly retrieves the package version and assigns it to `__version__`.\n- No malicious indicators, no data leaks, no untrusted sinks.\n- No anomalies beyond the standard usage of `__package__`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code does exactly what it claims: providing CLI utilities for VFX frame sequences, specifically managing version info. No security issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **None identified.** All reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n- The only minor point is that reliance on `__package__` could be considered slightly risky if the package context is manipulated, but this is a standard pattern in Python packaging and not a security concern in typical use.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n| Issue        | Report # | Reported Malware | Reported SecurityRisk | Suggested Score | Justification |\n|--------------|------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 1-5        | 0                  | 0                      | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated   | 1-5        | 0                  | 0                      | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation. |\n| Risk         | 1-5        | 0-0.1 (mostly 0)   | 0-0.1 (mostly 0)       | 0                 | No significant security risk; minimal code, no external inputs. |\n\nThe scores seem appropriate. The only point is that the `securityRisk` is marginally above zero in some reports, but given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n\n- Some reports mention the use of `__package__` could be unsafe if manipulated externally. While theoretically possible, in standard usage, this is safe and common in Python packaging.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on the code's logic are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — minimal security risk, no external inputs, no data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple utility to retrieve and store its package version. All reports correctly identify it as benign. No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
