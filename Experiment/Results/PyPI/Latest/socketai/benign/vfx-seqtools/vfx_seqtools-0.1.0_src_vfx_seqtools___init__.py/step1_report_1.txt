  "flows": "Retrieval of package version information from __package__ using importlib.metadata",
  "anomalies": "Usage of __package__ without validation; minimal code, no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to retrieve the version of the current package, which is standard practice for version management. There are no input sources such as network, files, or environment variables. The only operation is fetching the package version, which does not pose security risks. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to typical patterns for Python CLI utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It solely retrieves the package version for informational purposes.",
