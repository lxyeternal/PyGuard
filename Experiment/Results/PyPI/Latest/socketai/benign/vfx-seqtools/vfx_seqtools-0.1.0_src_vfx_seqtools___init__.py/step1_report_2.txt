{
  "purpose": "This code provides CLI utilities for handling VFX frame sequences, primarily managing package version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata to determine the version using importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or harmful actions are indicated.",
  "flows": "The source (importlib.metadata.version(__package__)) reads package metadata; this information is stored in __version__ but is not used further.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, malicious patterns, or obfuscated elements. The use of __package__ could be unsafe if the package context is manipulated externally, but in standard usage, it is safe.",
  "analysis": "The script imports importlib.metadata to access package version information. It assigns this version to __version__. There are no external inputs, no data flows to untrusted sinks, and no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The code appears to be a typical utility for version tracking. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to retrieve and store the package version. No malicious or security issues are detected.",
