  "purpose": "Provides CLI utilities for VFX frame sequences, primarily managing package version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or outputs handling untrusted input",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of __package__ for dynamic version retrieval; no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module to obtain the version of the current package dynamically. It assigns this version to __version__. The approach is standard for version management in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no external inputs or untrusted data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for retrieving package version information. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
