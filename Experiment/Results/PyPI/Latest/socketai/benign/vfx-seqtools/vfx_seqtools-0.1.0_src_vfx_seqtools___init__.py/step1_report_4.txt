  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only accesses package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata to dynamically get package version is standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of its own package via __package__. It serves as a simple utility to report package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. It does not handle user input, network activity, or sensitive data. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for package version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and benign utility for obtaining package version info. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
