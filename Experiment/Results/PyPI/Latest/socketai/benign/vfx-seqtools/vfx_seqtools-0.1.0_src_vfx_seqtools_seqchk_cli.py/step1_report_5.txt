{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper that invokes the 'seqchk' function from an external module, likely providing command-line interface access to sequence checking functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely received through the CLI command invoked by the user; specifically, the 'seqchk' function imported from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqchk'.",
  "sinks": "The 'seqchk' function is invoked directly without modification; potential sinks depend on its internal implementation, which is not shown here.",
  "flows": "User inputs via CLI are passed to the 'seqchk' function, which is called when the script is executed; data flows from command line to the imported function.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is a minimal CLI wrapper without embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typer' for CLI functionality and the 'seqchk' function. It creates a Typer app and registers 'seqchk' as a CLI command. The script executes the app if run directly. No data processing, no external network calls, and no obfuscated or suspicious code are present. The core logic depends on 'seqchk', which is not shown here, so its security cannot be assessed. Overall, this is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple CLI interface for the 'seqchk' function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this code snippet itself. The security risk depends on the implementation of 'seqchk', which is external and not provided. The code is benign and standard for CLI wrappers.",
