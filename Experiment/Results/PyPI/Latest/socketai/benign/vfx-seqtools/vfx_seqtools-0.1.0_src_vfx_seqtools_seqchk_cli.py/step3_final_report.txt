{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper that delegates execution to the external function 'seqchk' via Typer.",
  "sources": "Import of 'seqchk' from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqchk' and command registration with Typer.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'seqchk' as a command; no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "CLI invocation triggers 'seqchk' function; no internal data flow within this wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and registers it as a CLI command with Typer. It contains no input validation, data handling, or network activity. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'seqchk', which is not provided. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. The overall risk is minimal, and the code appears safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. Security concerns depend on the external 'seqchk' implementation. The reports accurately reflect this, and no score adjustments are necessary.",
