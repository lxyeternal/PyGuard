{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper that invokes the 'seqchk' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqchk' module, intended for command-line use.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments processed by 'typer' and the imported 'seqchk' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'seqchk' function is called with command-line parameters; potential data leaks depend on its internal implementation, which is not shown.",
  "flows": "User input via command line flows through 'typer' to invoke 'seqchk' with those parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code simply sets up a command-line interface and delegates to another function.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' to create a CLI application and registers the 'seqchk' function as a command. The main block runs the CLI. No suspicious code or obfuscation present. The security depends on 'seqchk's implementation, which is not provided. No input validation or sanitization is evident here, but that is handled within 'seqchk' if needed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk depends entirely on the implementation of 'seqchk', which is not shown. The code itself is benign.",
