{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a CLI wrapper for the 'seqchk' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqchk' module, enabling command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'seqchk' from an external module, and the '__main__' block initiating the CLI app.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak; the script primarily delegates to an external function.",
  "flows": "User executes the CLI command, which triggers 'seqchk' via Typer; data flow depends on 'seqchk' implementation, but not evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Typer to create a command-line interface, linking the 'seqchk' function for CLI use. It has no input processing, data handling, or external network communication within this snippet. The implementation is simple and appears to be a standard CLI wrapper. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are visible, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic CLI wrapper for an external function, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe, functioning only as a conduit to 'seqchk'.",
