{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI wrapper for the 'seqchk' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqchk' module, providing a command-line interface to invoke this function.",
  "sources": "Imports 'typer' and 'seqchk' function; the 'app.command()' decorator registers the 'seqchk' command; the '__main__' block executes the Typer app.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; there is no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves setting up a CLI command using Typer and executing it if run as main. No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for setting up a CLI command using Typer. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for creating a CLI and registers a command 'seqchk'. It then runs the CLI application if the script is executed directly. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The actual functionality depends on the 'seqchk' function, but this wrapper itself appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, insecure code, or suspicious patterns. It simply exposes the 'seqchk' function via command line.",
