  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `typer` and a function `seqchk` from an external module.\n- Sets up a Typer CLI app.\n- Registers `seqchk` as a command.\n- Runs the CLI if executed as the main script.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for a CLI wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues are present in the code itself.** It is a simple wrapper delegating to an external function.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious code.**\n- **They note that security depends on the implementation of `seqchk`, which is not shown.** This is accurate.\n- **No report mentions input validation or sanitization, but since the wrapper delegates to `seqchk`, which may handle that, this is acceptable.**\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code. No signs of malicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Scores are low (0.0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in the wrapper itself.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The only potential concern is the external `seqchk` function. However, since the wrapper code itself is benign, and the reports correctly avoid assigning high risk without evidence, the scores seem justified.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since the code is only delegating to an external function, and no malicious activity is evident, malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- All reports avoid assumptions about `seqchk`'s internal security. This is correct, as we cannot assess it from this snippet.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities, which is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code snippet and reports, the security posture appears benign.** The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at zero or very low, as currently reflected.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal inherent risk; depends on external function, but the wrapper itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard CLI wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The assessments in the reports are accurate and aligned with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
