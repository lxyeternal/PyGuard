{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the seqchk function, providing a command-line interface using the Typer library.",
  "sources": "User executes the CLI command; potentially untrusted input is passed to the 'seqchk' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'seqchk' function may process input; no direct data sinks are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input from the user flows into the CLI, which calls the 'seqchk' function; any untrusted data is processed within 'seqchk'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external 'seqchk' function without inline logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' to create a command-line interface and links a command to the 'seqchk' function from an external module. It sets up a Typer app, registers the command, and executes the app if run as a script. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected in this wrapper. The security implications depend on the implementation of 'seqchk', which is not provided here. The code itself is straightforward and standard for CLI wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper with no inherent malicious intent or security risks. Its security depends on the 'seqchk' function, which is external. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
