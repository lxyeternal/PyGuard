{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface wrapper for the 'seqdo' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo' module, likely facilitating user interaction with that function.",
  "sources": "The script imports 'seqdo' from an external module; no user input, environment variables, or external data sources are directly read in this script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code mainly sets up a CLI command and executes it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard 'typer' CLI setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI framework ('typer') and a function ('seqdo') from an internal module. It creates a Typer app, registers the 'seqdo' command, and executes the app if run as the main script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The script functions as a simple CLI wrapper with no external data handling or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a minimal CLI wrapper for the 'seqdo' function with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger application or toolkit.",
