  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `typer` and `seqdo` from `vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo`.\n- Sets up a Typer CLI app.\n- Registers `seqdo` as a CLI command.\n- Runs the app if executed as main.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper, delegating to an external function.\n- No data input, output, or network activity within this snippet.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The behavior of `seqdo` is unknown; its internal implementation could carry risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Issue presence in code:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. They also correctly note that the actual security implications depend on `seqdo`'s implementation, which is external and not inspectable here.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly emphasize that the code is a simple wrapper and that any security concerns are tied to `seqdo`'s internal behavior, not the wrapper itself.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign appearance. Some reports assign a small security risk (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the dependency on an external function. The report with the lowest confidence (0.7) appropriately reflects uncertainty about `seqdo`.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:**  \n  All reports assign 0 to malware and obfuscated, which is appropriate. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No report claims or implies vulnerabilities beyond the scope of the wrapper. They acknowledge that `seqdo`'s internal behavior is unknown, which is a responsible caveat.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores adjustment:**  \n  Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk very low (~0.1-0.2).  \n  Since the code is a straightforward wrapper, I would suggest **reducing the security risk score to 0** for all reports, unless there is specific knowledge about `seqdo`.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  No reason exists to assign a risk higher than 0.5. The only concern is that `seqdo` might do malicious things internally, but that cannot be inferred from this wrapper code alone.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (since the wrapper is benign, and no malicious behavior is detectable or implied)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- The code appears safe; the security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external `seqdo`.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- I recommend setting all scores to zero, reflecting the benign nature of this wrapper code.\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are justified in their conclusions.**",
