  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports 'typer' and an external 'seqdo' function, then registers it as a CLI command.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network connections, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The actual behavior of 'seqdo' is unknown; it could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation, but this is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a simple wrapper with no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9). No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative. Given the code, the low securityRisk score is reasonable, but perhaps a tiny bit higher than zero could be justified if considering the external 'seqdo' function, which isn't inspectable here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with full confidence (1.0). No issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Again, no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that the security risk depends on 'seqdo' implementation; the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable, given the dependency on an external function. The low securityRisk score reflects that.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code is a simple wrapper, the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is the behavior of 'seqdo', which isn't inspectable here. The scores reflect this appropriately, with some reports assigning a small risk (0.1 or 0.2) acknowledging that risk depends on 'seqdo'.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- Since the code is straightforward and there's no suspicious activity, **a malware score higher than 0 is unwarranted**.\n- The **securityRisk scores** could be uniformly set to 0 unless there's specific knowledge about 'seqdo'.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no inherent security issues in this snippet; risk depends on 'seqdo')\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The scores are appropriate given the information.\n- No changes needed unless additional context about 'seqdo' suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard CLI wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues evident from the snippet. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The security risk should also be 0 unless the external 'seqdo' function is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nLet's proceed with this assessment unless further information about 'seqdo' becomes available.",
