{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqdo' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo' module, providing command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'seqdo' function from an external module; no other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the 'seqdo' function, which may perform actions based on command-line input; potential risk depends on 'seqdo' implementation.",
  "flows": "The CLI command triggers 'seqdo' when executed; data flows from command-line input to 'seqdo' execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'typer' to create a CLI interface, exposing the 'seqdo' function as a command. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code within this snippet. The security risk largely depends on the implementation of 'seqdo', which is imported from an external module. Without inspecting 'seqdo', no malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied. The code itself appears benign and standard for creating CLI wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper around an external function with no obvious malicious or suspicious behavior within this fragment. The security implications depend on 'seqdo's' implementation, which is not provided.",
