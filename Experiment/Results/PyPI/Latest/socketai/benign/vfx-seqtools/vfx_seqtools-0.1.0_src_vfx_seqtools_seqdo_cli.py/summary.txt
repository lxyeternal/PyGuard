  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk primarily depends on the implementation of 'seqdo', which cannot be assessed here. Based on the code provided, all indicators point to a safe component, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.15) to account for external dependency uncertainty."
