{
  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface wrapper for the 'seqdo' function from the vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'seqdo' function from an external module; no direct input reading or data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks; it simply registers and executes a command-line command which may invoke 'seqdo'.",
  "flows": "The script initializes a CLI application and invokes 'seqdo' when the command runs; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; the code is straightforward and standard for a CLI wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typer' for CLI management and a 'seqdo' function from an external module. It registers 'seqdo' as a CLI command and executes the CLI app if run as main. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations, or suspicious behaviors. Since 'seqdo' is imported from an external module, its internal behavior is unknown but not inspectable from this snippet. The code appears to be a minimal CLI wrapper with standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that registers and runs the 'seqdo' command. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks within this snippet. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues.",
