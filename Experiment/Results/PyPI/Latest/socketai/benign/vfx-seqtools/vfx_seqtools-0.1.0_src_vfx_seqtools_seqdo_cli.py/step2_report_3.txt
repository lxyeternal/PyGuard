  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports the 'seqdo' function from an external module (`vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo`) and registers it as a command using the 'typer' CLI framework. When executed, it runs the CLI application, which in turn calls 'seqdo' with command-line arguments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed facts:\n- The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or manipulate sensitive data directly.\n- The 'seqdo' function's internal behavior is unknown from this snippet; its security implications depend on its implementation.\n- The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper, common in many open source projects.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Finds no malicious behavior, no anomalies.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe, and the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings, with slightly less confidence (0.9).\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Notes that 'seqdo' is external, so internal behavior is unknown.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.1).\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code itself is safe; the potential risk hinges on 'seqdo'.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: a simple wrapper, no malicious code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The security risk depends on 'seqdo'.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more cautious, with confidence 0.7.\n- Recognizes that the actual security implications depend on 'seqdo'.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Security risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the dependency on external code.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The code itself is benign, but the potential risk from 'seqdo' is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n### Logical consistency and scoring:\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the dependency on an external function whose behavior is unknown but not suspected of maliciousness based on this snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless evidence suggests malicious behavior within 'seqdo'.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if there is concern about 'seqdo's' internal implementation, but given only this code, keeping it low is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code snippet and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected or suspected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to dependency on external code whose behavior is unknown but not suspicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious behavior. The potential security concern depends entirely on the implementation of 'seqdo', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Given the evidence, I would assign a very low risk score, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of 'seqdo' itself to fully assess security implications.",
