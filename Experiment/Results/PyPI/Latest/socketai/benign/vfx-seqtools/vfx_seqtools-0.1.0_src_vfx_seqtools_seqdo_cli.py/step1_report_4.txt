  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the seqdo function from the vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo module.",
  "sources": "Importing the seqdo function from an internal module, reading command-line invocation.",
  "sinks": "Calling the seqdo function when the CLI command is executed.",
  "flows": "User runs CLI → app command triggers seqdo → seqdo executes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a command-line interface library (typer), sets up a CLI app, and registers an external function (seqdo) as a command. It then runs the app if executed as main. There are no hidden or suspicious operations, no external data being read (beyond typical CLI invocation), and no apparent malicious code or data leaks. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a simple wrapper for a functionality defined elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI wrapper for an existing function. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the visible code. It appears safe.",
