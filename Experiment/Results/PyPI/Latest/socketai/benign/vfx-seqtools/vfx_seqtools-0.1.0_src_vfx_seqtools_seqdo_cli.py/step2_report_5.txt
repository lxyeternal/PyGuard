  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports 'seqdo' from an external module and registers it as a command via Typer.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The actual behavior of 'seqdo' is unknown; it could perform any operation depending on its implementation.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code itself appears benign and straightforward.\n- The primary concern is the behavior of 'seqdo', which cannot be assessed from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is a simple wrapper with no evident issues.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the scores as is.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, but still consistent with the code.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, given the unknown behavior of 'seqdo'.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Notes that actual risk depends on 'seqdo' implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified; since 'seqdo' is external, potential risks could exist depending on its implementation.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable; malware remains 0 as no malicious code is present here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Analysis & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree that there's no evidence of malicious code in this snippet. I concur; malware score should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; keep at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the core code is benign but the behavior of 'seqdo' is unknown, a conservative risk score of around **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate, reflecting some uncertainty.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** **0.15** (acknowledging that 'seqdo' could perform risky operations depending on its implementation)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code itself is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious behavior. The primary concern is the external 'seqdo' function, which could potentially perform harmful actions depending on its internal implementation. Given the information, the current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0, set securityRisk around 0.15, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of external dependencies.",
