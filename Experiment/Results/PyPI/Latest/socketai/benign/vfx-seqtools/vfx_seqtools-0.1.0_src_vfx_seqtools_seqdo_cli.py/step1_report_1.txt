  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqdo' function from the vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo module, providing a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Importing 'typer' for CLI and importing 'seqdo' from an external module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted data, external network connections, or sensitive data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "The CLI invokes the 'seqdo' function when executed, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a CLI command, and calls 'seqdo' via Typer. It appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper without embedded malicious code. There are no external data sources or sinks. The code structure is standard and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI wrapper that delegates to an external function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
