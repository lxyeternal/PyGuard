{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqdo' function, providing command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports 'typer' for CLI framework; imports 'seqdo' from external module 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqdo'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or data leaks present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Command-line invocation triggers 'app()', which executes 'seqdo' as registered command.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper that delegates execution to an external 'seqdo' function. It contains no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The security implications depend entirely on the internal implementation of 'seqdo', which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate sensitive data directly. Given the benign structure, malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score should be minimal, reflecting the external dependency's unknown behavior, but no evidence suggests malicious intent within this wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI wrapper with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk primarily depends on the implementation of 'seqdo', which cannot be assessed here. Based on the code provided, all indicators point to a safe component, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.15) to account for external dependency uncertainty.",
