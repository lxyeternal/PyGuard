  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the seqrm function, providing command-line access via the Typer library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typer' and 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm', execution entry point (__main__).",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'seqrm' function upon CLI command execution.",
  "flows": "User runs CLI -> Typer calls 'seqrm' -> 'seqrm' executes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no unusual data flows or side-effects evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Typer for CLI creation and a specific function 'seqrm' from an external package. It registers 'seqrm' as a CLI command and executes the CLI application if run as main. The code appears straightforward and typical for creating a CLI wrapper. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'seqrm', which is external and not provided here. The code structure is simple, standard, and does not include any obfuscation or risky constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for an external function with no visible malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It relies on the behavior of 'seqrm', which cannot be assessed here. Based on this code alone, it appears safe.",
