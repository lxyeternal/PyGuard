{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqrm function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm, likely intended to provide command-line interface access.",
  "sources": "The code imports the seqrm function and the typer library; no input reading from external sources like user input or environment variables within this script.",
  "sinks": "The script executes the seqrm function when called; potential risk depends on what seqrm does internally. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User executes CLI, which triggers app(), calling seqrm; any input flows depend on seqrm implementation, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a command-line interface using Typer, a common Python CLI library. It registers the seqrm function as a command. There are no apparent security issues or malicious code. The script does not handle or process input data directly; its behavior depends on seqrm. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple CLI wrapper that invokes an external function. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this module. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming seqrm itself is secure.",
