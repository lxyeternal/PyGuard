  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around an external function `seqrm`.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The actual behavior and security implications depend on the implementation of `seqrm`, which is external and not provided here.\n- The code structure is standard, with no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data handling visible.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple CLI wrapper with no evident issues or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- **No significant errors or flaws.**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign CLI wrapper.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Confidence scores (0.9 or 1):**  \n  These seem reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code and the consistent analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Malware scores (0):**  \n  Correct, no malware behavior observed.\n\n- **SecurityRisk scores:**  \n  Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk based on this code alone. Since the actual `seqrm` function's behavior isn't known, these are appropriately low.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No issues or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is a simple CLI wrapper, which by itself does not introduce security risks.\n- The risk depends on the external `seqrm` implementation, which isn't analyzed here.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- Since no malicious activity is observed or claimed, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume `seqrm` is secure; without its implementation, this cannot be confirmed, but given the code context, this is a reasonable assumption.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity detected or implied.                      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                         |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0–0.2 | Minimal risk; depends on external function, but no issues here. |\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk, assuming `seqrm` is secure)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code appears safe, with no evident security issues or malware. The overall security posture is very low risk, assuming the external `seqrm` function is secure and free of malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed no issues in the code.  \n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The overall risk is minimal.",
