{
  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for the seqrm function, likely to facilitate command-line usage of sequence removal or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "Importing 'typer' for CLI handling, importing 'seqrm' from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm",
  "sinks": "Calling 'seqrm' as a command in the CLI, which may execute code when invoked",
  "flows": "User runs the CLI, Typer processes the command, and invokes 'seqrm'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or unusual code patterns, straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a command-line interface using Typer and registers the 'seqrm' function as a command. It imports 'typer' and a specific function from a module. The script simply runs the CLI when executed directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data handling. The 'seqrm' function's implementation is not shown, so its behavior cannot be analyzed, but from this code alone, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a CLI wrapper for an imported function without any visible malicious intent. The overall structure is simple and benign. However, the security of the overall tool depends on the implementation of 'seqrm', which is not provided here.",
