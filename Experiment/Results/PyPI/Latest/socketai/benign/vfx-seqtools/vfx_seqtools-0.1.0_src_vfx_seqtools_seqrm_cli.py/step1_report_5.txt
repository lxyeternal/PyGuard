{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for seqrm command-line utility, providing a command interface for the seqrm function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm.",
  "sources": "import statements importing 'typer' and 'seqrm' from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data outputs, network communications, or system modifications are evident",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up CLI commands",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure, straightforward command registration, no hidden or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'typer' library to create a CLI interface and registers the 'seqrm' function as a command. The code is minimal and typical for a CLI wrapper, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network calls, nor any indication of malicious intent. The code simply sets up a command-line interface for an existing function.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only facilitates invoking 'seqrm' via command line, with no evidence of malicious activity or security concerns.",
