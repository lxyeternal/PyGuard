  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqrm function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typer' and 'seqrm' from a local or external module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'app()' command which runs the CLI application; no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI command -> 'app()' executes -> calls 'seqrm' command handler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of standard CLI framework 'typer'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typer' to create a CLI wrapper around the 'seqrm' command from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm' module. The 'app' object is a 'typer.Typer' instance, with 'seqrm' registered as a command. The main block executes 'app()' to run the CLI. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a simple CLI interface designed to invoke an existing function.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a CLI wrapper around the 'seqrm' function. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It is a straightforward, standard implementation using 'typer'.",
