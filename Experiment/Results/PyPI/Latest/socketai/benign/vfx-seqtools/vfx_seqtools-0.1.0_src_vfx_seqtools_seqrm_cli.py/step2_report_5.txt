  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and potential risks.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that imports and registers an external function (`seqrm`) using Typer.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The actual behavior of `seqrm` is unknown, but the wrapper itself appears benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their analysis, correctly noting the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - They appropriately mention that the security or maliciousness depends on the implementation of `seqrm`, which is external and not provided.\n   - No report overstates the security; they assign low security risk scores, which seems reasonable.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk based on the code itself.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is a simple CLI wrapper, the risk is minimal unless `seqrm` itself is malicious.\n   - Without knowledge of `seqrm`'s internal implementation, we cannot assign high risk scores.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about `seqrm`.\n   - They correctly state that the overall security depends on the external function.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: low obfuscation, no malware, minimal security risk.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily dependent on external function behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, standard CLI wrapper with no suspicious or malicious elements. The risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately low. The overall security posture relies on the external `seqrm` function, which cannot be evaluated here but is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a slight adjustment to the security risk score to 0.1 for conservativeness.\n- No changes needed unless additional context about `seqrm` is provided.",
