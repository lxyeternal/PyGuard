  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper using Typer.\n- It imports a function `seqrm` from `vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm`.\n- When run, it registers `seqrm` as a CLI command.\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no input processing, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The behavior and security implications depend on `seqrm`, which is external and not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All describe the code as a simple CLI wrapper around `seqrm`.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The analysis concludes that the code is benign, with security risks considered minimal or none.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), and malware scores are zero.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The code matches the description: a straightforward CLI wrapper.  \n- No issues or vulnerabilities are visible in the code snippet itself.\n\n**2. Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify that the code's security implications depend on `seqrm`.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- Security risk scores are very low, matching the benign analysis.  \n- Confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n- Since the code is just a wrapper, and no malicious activity is evident, higher scores are unwarranted unless `seqrm` itself is malicious, which cannot be determined here.  \n- The reports correctly avoid assigning high risk scores based solely on this wrapper.\n\n**5. Is there any assumption that could be challenged?**  \n- The main assumption is that `seqrm` is safe. Since its implementation is unknown, the overall security depends on it.  \n- However, within the scope of this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven all this, **the code appears benign, and the reports' evaluations are accurate**. The overall security risk is minimal, with no malware activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, assuming `seqrm` is safe; if there's concern about `seqrm`, it should be evaluated separately)\n\n**Note:** The true security posture hinges on `seqrm`'s implementation, which is outside the scope of this wrapper code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is a standard, safe CLI wrapper with no evident security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
