  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqrm' function, providing command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports 'seqrm' from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqrm' and Typer library for CLI registration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; relies on external 'seqrm' implementation.",
  "flows": "Command registration via Typer leads to execution of 'seqrm' when CLI is invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward CLI wrapper with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports 'seqrm' and registers it as a command using Typer. It contains no input validation, data processing, or suspicious patterns. The security implications depend entirely on the external 'seqrm' function, which is not provided. The code itself is benign, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2, high confidence) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, and the code is a straightforward wrapper, the overall security risk is minimal, contingent on the safety of 'seqrm'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the scores assigned are justified. The overall security posture depends on the external 'seqrm' implementation, which is outside the scope of this review.",
