{
  "purpose": "This code provides command-line interface options and utilities for a package called vfx-seqtools, including version display, logging configuration, verbosity, and frame sequence handling.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from command-line options and environment variables, such as log file paths, log levels, and user flags.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (e.g., log file paths, frame sequence strings) are used in log handlers and may be written to files or output streams.",
  "flows": "User inputs (command-line options) flow into logger configuration, option return values, and command behavior flags. There are no data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code solely manages CLI options and logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for command-line options using the Typer library, including version, dry run, logging, interactive prompts, verbosity, strictness, quiet mode, sequence-only mode, frame range, frame sequence, and threading. The logging_options function configures log handlers and formatters based on user input. All inputs are handled as options with default values. There are no external data fetches, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The code's structure and usage are straightforward, focusing on CLI parameter parsing and logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, handling CLI options and logging configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or security issues. It functions solely as a command-line utility configuration module.",
