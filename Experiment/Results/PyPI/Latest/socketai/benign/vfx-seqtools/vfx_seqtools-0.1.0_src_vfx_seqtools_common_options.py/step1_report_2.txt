{
  "purpose": "This code provides CLI options and logging setup utilities for a VFX sequence toolset, mainly to configure program behavior, logging, and user interaction.",
  "sources": "User input options via Typer command-line arguments, environment variables (not explicitly used here but potential for expansion), and input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console and optionally to a file; command-line argument values that could influence program flow.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., log level, file paths, flags) influence logger configuration and program behavior; no untrusted data flows into critical security-sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external network access is evident. The logging setup and CLI options are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI options and logging setup, all with standard patterns. No external data sources or sinks are used in a suspicious manner. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are apparent. The functions are well-structured, simple, and do not handle untrusted input in ways that could lead to vulnerabilities. The only data input is from command-line options, which are managed safely via Typer, and logging configuration is typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for CLI configuration and logging setup. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The overall design is standard and secure.",
