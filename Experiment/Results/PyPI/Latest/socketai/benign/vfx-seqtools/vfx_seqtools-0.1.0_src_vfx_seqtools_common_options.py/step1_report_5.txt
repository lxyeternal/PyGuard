{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility options for a command-line tool related to VFX frame sequence processing, including version display, logging configuration, user interaction, verbosity, and thread management.",
  "sources": "Input options from command-line arguments (e.g., --version, --dry-run, --log-to-file, --interactive, --verbose, --strict, --quiet, --only-sequences, --frame-start, --frame-end, --frame-increment, --frame-seq, --threads).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, such as console and file logging; potential command-line flag values influencing behavior.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs are captured via typer options and used to configure logging, control flow (e.g., dry run, interactive mode), or specify parameters (e.g., frame ranges, thread counts).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Logging configuration and option handling are straightforward. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines utility functions for CLI options, including version display, logging setup, and parameter parsing. These functions process user-supplied arguments and configure the tool accordingly. There is no data processing, network activity, or external system interaction within this code segment. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code appears to be a standard CLI utility setup for a VFX processing tool, with safe and transparent handling of options. No potentially malicious patterns or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign CLI utility module setting up user options and logging. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It is safe to use in its current form.",
