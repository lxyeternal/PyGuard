  "purpose": "Utility functions for CLI options and logging configuration using Typer and Python's logging module.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for version, dry-run, logging, verbosity, strictness, quiet mode, sequence-only, frame ranges, frame sequence, threading, and other options.",
  "sinks": "Configuration of logger handlers and levels, setting program flags based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence logger setup and program behavior but do not lead to external system calls or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The only potential concern is user-controlled file paths for logs, which is standard but could be misused if set to sensitive locations.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI utility setup, configuring options and logging without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of external communication or obfuscated constructs support a benign assessment. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) accounts for user-controlled parameters but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility setup with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are justified and appropriate.",
