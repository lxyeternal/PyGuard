  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for command-line options and logging configuration for the vfx-seqtools package.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables indirectly via the logging configuration and command-line arguments supplied by the user.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files without validation, except for user-provided file paths for logging.",
  "flows": "User inputs from command-line options (e.g., --log-to-file, --frame-seq) flow into configuration objects like loggers and function parameters; no direct dangerous data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward utility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various command-line options and logging setup functions using Typer and Python's logging module. Inputs are mainly command-line flags and parameters, with no processing that involves untrusted data manipulation or external communication. The only potential concern is the log file path which could be set to a sensitive location if misused, but this is user-controlled and not inherently malicious. There is no code execution, dynamic code loading, or data exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility setup code for CLI applications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles user inputs safely, and no suspicious or malicious code is detected.",
