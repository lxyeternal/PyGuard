{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility options and configuration functions for a command-line interface tool related to VFX frame sequence management, including version display, logging, verbosity, and file handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments (e.g., --version, --dry-run, --log-to-file, --interactive, --verbose, --strict, --quiet, --only-sequences, --frame-start, --frame-end, --frame-increment, --frame-seq, --threads).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the logger (for output), file handlers (writing logs to files), and command-line arguments affecting program flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line input (sources) into configuration options that influence program behavior; no untrusted data directly flows into critical functions like network, system commands, or sensitive operations within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward option parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple configuration functions for CLI options, utilizing the 'typer' library for argument parsing. No external or untrusted data is processed insecurely. Logging configuration is standard and configurable; no malicious logging behavior is evident. The version display logic raises an exception to exit, which is typical for CLI version commands. No network or system manipulation occurs. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of CLI options for a command-line tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is safe and typical in nature.",
