  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the seqmv functionality from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv",
  "sources": "Importing 'typer' and 'seqmv' function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI, which calls the 'seqmv' function; data flows from CLI input to the function call",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'typer' for CLI creation and wraps the 'seqmv' function as a command. The code is minimal, straightforward, and only sets up command-line interface functionality. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. It relies on external modules ('typer' and 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv') which are assumed to be benign, as no malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI wrapper with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an entry point for the 'seqmv' function via command line, with no suspicious patterns or embedded malicious code.",
