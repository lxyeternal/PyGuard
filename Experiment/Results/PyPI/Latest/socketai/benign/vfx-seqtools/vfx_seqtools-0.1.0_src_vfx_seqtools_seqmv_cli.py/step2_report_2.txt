  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports a function `seqmv` from an external module and exposes it via `typer`. It then runs the CLI if executed directly.\n   - The code itself contains no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n   - The implementation is straightforward, and the code acts solely as an interface.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - They correctly note that the security implications depend on the implementation of `seqmv`, which is not visible here.\n   - The reports assign very low malware and security risk scores (mostly 0 or close to 0), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not assume malicious intent beyond what the code shows.\n   - No report overstates the risk; all correctly emphasize that the actual security risk depends on the imported `seqmv`.\n\n4. **Score Analysis and Recommendations:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the code.\n   - Since the code is a straightforward wrapper, no changes to scores are necessary based solely on this snippet.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code itself does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Any malicious behavior would originate from `seqmv`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - The reports appropriately do not attribute malware to this wrapper.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - If `seqmv` internally performs malicious actions, that would be a concern, but this cannot be inferred from the wrapper code.\n   - The reports correctly highlight that the security posture depends on the implementation of `seqmv`.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI wrapper.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The risk scores should remain very low unless additional context about `seqmv` indicates otherwise.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0 unless `seqmv` is known to be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain very low (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2), reflecting that the wrapper itself is benign but depends on external code.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that there are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the code is a standard CLI wrapper. Any higher scores would be unjustified without further information about the behavior of `seqmv`.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the dependency on external code, which is unknown here but presumed benign)\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence.",
