{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for the 'seqmv' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv' module, allowing users to invoke it via command line.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'seqmv' function and the 'typer' module, then attaches 'seqmv' as a command to the Typer app. It does not read external input directly within this script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code; no untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining the CLI application to invoking 'seqmv' when the script runs, but it does not handle or process untrusted data internally.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward, acting as a CLI wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a command from an external module and registers it as a CLI command using Typer. It contains no data handling, no user input processing within this script, and no apparent malicious logic. The functionality depends on the imported 'seqmv' function, which is not shown; if 'seqmv' itself is malicious, that cannot be determined from this code alone. The script itself is a simple wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI wrapper that registers an external function for command-line execution. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Its security profile relies on the security of the 'seqmv' function imported from elsewhere.",
