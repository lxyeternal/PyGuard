  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that imports and exposes the 'seqmv' function via 'typer'.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The implementation is straightforward, and all reports agree that the code itself is benign.\n- The security posture depends entirely on the implementation of 'seqmv', which is not visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple CLI wrapper, with no visible malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no signs of malicious activity in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a very low risk (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's simplicity, this seems reasonable. However, since the actual 'seqmv' function is unknown, the risk could be higher if 'seqmv' is malicious, but from this code alone, it cannot be determined.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious activity, so a high risk score is unjustified.\n- The scores assigned (mostly 0 or near-zero) are appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk, but acknowledging dependence on external 'seqmv')  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code itself is benign and standard.  \n- No malicious indicators are present.  \n- The security risk is minimal but not zero, because the actual behavior depends on the imported 'seqmv' function, which could be malicious if compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable given the code.\n- No adjustments needed unless further information about 'seqmv' is provided.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set the security risk score at around 0.1 to acknowledge the dependency on external code.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to review the 'seqmv' implementation itself or provide further analysis.",
