{
  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper that exposes the 'seqmv' function as a command-line command using 'typer'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'seqmv' from 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv' and registers it as a CLI command.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI; 'seqmv' is called as the command; no internal data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that imports an external function and registers it as a command. It contains no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'seqmv', which is outside this snippet. The code does not process user input directly or perform network/file operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this wrapper and assign low malware and security risk scores. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting reliance on external code. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. Security risks are minimal and depend on the external 'seqmv' implementation. The scores assigned are consistent and justified.",
