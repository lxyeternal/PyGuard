  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that imports a function `seqmv` from an external module and registers it as a command using `typer`.  \n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.  \n- The code itself does not process user input directly, nor does it perform network operations or handle sensitive data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is benign and acts solely as a wrapper.  \n- They emphasize that security risks depend on the implementation of `seqmv`, which is not visible here.  \n- No inaccuracies or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue and suggest any changes if unreasonable:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.  \n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is reasonable.  \n- Since the code only wraps an external function, the risk depends on `seqmv`'s implementation.  \n- Without evidence of malicious behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about `seqmv`'s internal behavior.  \n- They recognize that the security implications depend on the external module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**6. Make sure the scores are consistent with the report:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- The code itself is a benign CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- The malware scores are appropriately zero, and security risk scores are minimal.  \n- The confidence levels are justified given the limited scope.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because the code's security depends on the external `seqmv` implementation, which is unknown but presumed benign here)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward CLI wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways review the implementation of `seqmv` itself to fully assess security, as this wrapper merely delegates execution.",
