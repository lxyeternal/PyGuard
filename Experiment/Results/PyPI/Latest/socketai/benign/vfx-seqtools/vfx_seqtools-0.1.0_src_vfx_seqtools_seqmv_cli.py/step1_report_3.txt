{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for the 'seqmv' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv' module, enabling users to invoke 'seqmv' via CLI commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it imports and executes an existing function ('seqmv') from a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, handle network operations, or perform any sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: it initializes the CLI app, registers the 'seqmv' command, and executes the CLI if run as the main module. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'typer' library to create a CLI interface and registers the 'seqmv' function as a command. It then runs the CLI application if executed directly. There are no user inputs processed within this script, nor does it handle any untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious. The functionality depends on the imported 'seqmv' function, but the script itself is a typical CLI wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply facilitates running an existing function via command line. No malware or security issues are detected.",
