  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that imports a function `seqmv` from an external module (`vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv`) and exposes it as a command-line command via the `typer` library.\n- It contains no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The execution flow is minimal: set up CLI app, register command, run if main.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code itself does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Implementation of `seqmv`:** Unknown; the security and behavior depend entirely on the external `seqmv` function.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None visible within this wrapper code.\n- **Data handling:** No user input processing or data flow within this snippet, so no immediate attack surface.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or anomalies:** None detected.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The analysis correctly states that the security posture depends on the implementation of `seqmv`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or data leaks are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 to 0.1 in some reports, reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on external code. This seems reasonable since the wrapper itself is benign, but the overall security depends on `seqmv`.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- If `seqmv` is malicious, the wrapper would be a conduit. But from this code alone, no evidence supports that.\n- No assumptions are made about `seqmv`; the reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily because the security depends on external code)\n\n**Note:** The high confidence levels and consistent findings across reports support this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign CLI wrapper.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The security risk is minimal, contingent on the external `seqmv` implementation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
