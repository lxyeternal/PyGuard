{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI wrapper for the 'seqmv' function from the 'vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv' module, providing command-line interface functionality using the 'typer' library.",
  "sources": "Import of 'typer' library and the 'seqmv' function; invocation of 'app.command()' which wraps 'seqmv'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'seqmv' via the Typer command registration; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The CLI command triggers 'seqmv' when executed; however, there is no evidence of input data handling within this code segment itself.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, sets up a Typer CLI app, registers the 'seqmv' function as a command, and runs the app if executed directly. There is no data processing, no user input handling shown here, and no network activity or file manipulation observed within this snippet. Since 'seqmv' is imported and invoked via command registration, any malicious behavior would depend on the implementation of 'seqmv', which is not provided. The wrapper itself is benign and standard for CLI interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper without any malicious or suspicious behavior within this segment. Its security depends on the implementation of 'seqmv', which is outside the scope of this review. There are no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent in this code.",
