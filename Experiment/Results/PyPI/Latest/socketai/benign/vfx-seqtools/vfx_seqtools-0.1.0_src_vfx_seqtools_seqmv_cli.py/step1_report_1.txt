{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the 'seqmv' function from vfx_seqtools.actions.seqmv module",
  "sources": "Importing 'seqmv' from an external module, reading command line input via 'typer'",
  "sinks": "Calling 'seqmv' with command line arguments, potential output or execution effects depend on 'seqmv'",
  "flows": "User input via CLI flows into 'seqmv' when invoked, but the specific internal logic of 'seqmv' is unknown",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns observed; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a CLI wrapper that imports a function 'seqmv' and exposes it as a command-line interface using 'typer'. The 'seqmv' function's internal behavior is not visible here, so any malicious activity would depend on its implementation. The code itself only facilitates command-line invocation and does not contain suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no data leakage mechanisms visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions solely as a CLI wrapper and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior on its own. Its security posture depends entirely on the implementation of 'seqmv'. Given only this code, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
