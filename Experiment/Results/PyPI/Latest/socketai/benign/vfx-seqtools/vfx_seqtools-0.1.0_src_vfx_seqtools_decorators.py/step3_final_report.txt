  "purpose": "Utility decorator to attach pre-execution hook functions to other functions, primarily for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts.",
  "sources": "Function signature parameters, inspect.signature parameters, keyword arguments passed to the wrapper.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hook function with filtered kwargs, injection of hook output into source function as a keyword argument.",
  "flows": "Kwargs filtered for hook parameters, hook function executed, hook result injected into source function, signature and annotations updated.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, external system calls, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard decorator factory that manipulates function signatures and annotations to enable sharing CLI options via hooks. It performs argument filtering, signature merging, and annotation updates in a straightforward manner. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The signature and annotation modifications are typical for CLI utility functions. The error handling for argument collisions is appropriate. Overall, the code is a benign utility for CLI argument sharing with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility decorator for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The signature manipulation is standard for such utilities and does not pose security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
