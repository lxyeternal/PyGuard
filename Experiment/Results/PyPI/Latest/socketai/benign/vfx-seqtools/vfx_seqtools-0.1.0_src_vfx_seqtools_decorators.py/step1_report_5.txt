  "purpose": "Utility to share command-line options across multiple Typer scripts by attaching hooks to functions, enabling shared argument groups.",
  "sources": "Import statements; the attach_hook function and its inner functions; inspect.signature calls; function decorators; signature and annotations manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hook_func and source_func; dynamic signature modifications; handling of kwargs and annotations.",
  "flows": "User invokes the decorator, which wraps the source function; during execution, hook_func is called with filtered kwargs, and its output is passed to source_func via a specified keyword argument.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code performs standard introspection and function wrapping; no external network connections or data leaks observed; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution beyond standard decorator behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory to attach hooks to functions, enabling shared CLI options in Typer scripts. It uses standard Python introspection and function wrapping techniques, with no signs of malicious behavior. Signature manipulations and annotation merging are performed explicitly and safely. The code's purpose is to enhance usability of command-line tools, not to perform malicious actions. No suspicious code flows, external communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The approach relies solely on Python's introspection, which is common for CLI argument handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing shared CLI options in Typer scripts. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no malware indicators, and poses no security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
