  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a decorator for sharing CLI options via hooks in Typer scripts, using function signatures and annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes hook with filtered kwargs; injects hook output into source function; signature and annotations are modified accordingly.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious indicators; well-structured code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility for CLI argument sharing, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 (appropriate).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focuses on attaching hooks for CLI options sharing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar flow of data; hook execution and argument passing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard argument manipulation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward decorator with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero but still low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The slightly elevated securityRisk score might be conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for sharing CLI options via hooks, using signature inspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to previous reports; argument filtering, hook execution, injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity; standard signature manipulation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (still low).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature; the securityRisk is marginally higher but still low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; sharing CLI options with hooks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature inspection, hook execution, argument passing.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious code; standard decorator pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a safe utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for CLI options sharing, signature manipulation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar argument filtering and hook execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior; standard approach.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a utility decorator for sharing CLI options via hooks, using introspection, argument filtering, and signature manipulation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; primarily related to argument handling, which is safe.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware scores are all zero, which is correct. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, primarily because of signature manipulation, which is standard for such utilities but could theoretically be misused if misapplied.\n\n**Note:** The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The minor security risk score is appropriate given the nature of signature manipulation but does not indicate any real threat.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
