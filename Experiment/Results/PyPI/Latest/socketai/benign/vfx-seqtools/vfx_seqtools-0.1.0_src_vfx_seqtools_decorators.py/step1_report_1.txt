{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility decorator for sharing command-line options across multiple Typer CLI scripts by attaching pre-execution hook functions to source functions, allowing shared argument definitions.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (hook_func, hook_output_kwarg), inside attach_hook() decorator, inspect.signature() calls, and the wrapper function handling kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hook_func with filtered kwargs, execution of source_func with combined args and hook output, modification of function signature and annotations.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into the wrapper, which filters and passes relevant kwargs to hook_func; hook_func output is injected into source_func call; combined signature and annotations are constructed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. The code appears well-structured for its purpose. No signs of malicious behavior or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to attach hook functions to source functions, mainly for CLI argument sharing in Typer scripts. It uses inspect to manipulate function signatures and annotations, enabling argument injection. The logic is straightforward and purpose-specific, with proper error handling for argument collisions. No external system calls, network activity, or potentially malicious code present. The implementation is consistent with standard practices for dynamic function wrapping.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for sharing CLI options across scripts using Typer. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unauthorized data access or system modifications.",
