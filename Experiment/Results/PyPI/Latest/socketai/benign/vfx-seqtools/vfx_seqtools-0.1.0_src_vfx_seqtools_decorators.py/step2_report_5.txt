  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes a utility decorator for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts, with focus on function arguments, inspect.signature, and argument handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly details data flow from decorator input through signature manipulation to function execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, credentials, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code manipulates function signatures for CLI argument sharing, which is a common pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid utility, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on attaching hooks for CLI options.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, just signature manipulation.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Slightly higher at 0.1, possibly due to the nature of signature modifications, but still benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, about sharing CLI options via decorators.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, just standard introspection and function wrapping.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for CLI argument sharing, same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators, standard techniques.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, confidence 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description, no deviation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, just function wrapping and signature handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect minimal concerns around signature manipulation, but these are standard for such utilities and do not indicate security issues.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the logic and reasoning are sound.\n- The code is a legitimate utility for CLI argument sharing, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern due to signature manipulation, but standard for such utilities)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
