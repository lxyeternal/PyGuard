  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Purpose: Utility decorator to attach pre-execution hook functions to other functions, primarily for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts.\n- Behavior: Uses `inspect` to analyze and modify function signatures, injects hook outputs as arguments, ensures no parameter collisions, and manages annotations.\n- Security implications: No external system calls, network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is purely for CLI argument handling.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Clear; utility for sharing options in Typer CLI scripts.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate. The code performs signature manipulation for CLI argument sharing without any malicious behavior. The high confidence score aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; utility for attaching hooks for CLI options.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is for signature wrapping and argument injection, with no malicious activity. The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) might be due to the signature manipulation, but this is standard for such decorators.\n\n**Justification for risk score:**  \nSignature modification and argument injection, if misused, could potentially cause issues, but not inherently malicious. The code itself is safe.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same utility purpose.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (higher)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious behavior. The increased security risk score reflects the signature manipulation, but this is standard for decorators of this type.\n\n**Justification:**  \nNo external communication or data handling is involved. Signature manipulation is a common pattern in CLI utilities.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is a standard decorator pattern with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior. The slight security risk score reflects the signature manipulation, which is normal for such decorators.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose as a CLI argument sharing utility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher security risk scores in some reports are justified by signature manipulations, but these are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of signature manipulation, a small risk score (~0.1) is acceptable, but not higher.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Value |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Malware          | 0      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0      |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1    |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No security concerns or malicious activity are present. The signature manipulation is a standard technique in CLI utilities and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated as 0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1).",
