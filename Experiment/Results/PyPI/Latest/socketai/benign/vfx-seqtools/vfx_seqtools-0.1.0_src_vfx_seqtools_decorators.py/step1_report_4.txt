{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to share common CLI options between multiple Typer scripts by attaching pre-execution hook functions that modify or add to the arguments passed to CLI commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function signatures, decorator arguments, and keyword arguments passed during function calls.",
  "sinks": "Function execution that can invoke hook functions, modify arguments, and execute source functions with combined parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data from decorator parameters and function call arguments flow into the hook function, then into the source function, with arguments potentially being modified or extended during the process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility decorator to attach hook functions to other functions, primarily for sharing CLI options in Typer scripts. It inspects function signatures, ensures no conflicting parameter names, and constructs a combined signature for the wrapper. The hook function is executed before the source function, and its output is injected as a keyword argument. All operations involve standard inspection, function wrapping, and signature manipulation, without any evidence of malicious code or hidden behaviors. The code is well-structured and adheres to normal Python patterns for decorators and introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate utility for sharing command-line options across Typer scripts. It employs common Python techniques without any malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
