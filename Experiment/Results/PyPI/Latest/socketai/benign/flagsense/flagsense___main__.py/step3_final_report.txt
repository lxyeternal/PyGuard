  "purpose": "A command-line utility to perform object detection on images or folders using a YOLO model via the Detector class.",
  "sources": "Input path provided via command-line argument; filesystem reads of image files; external Detector.detect() method.",
  "sinks": "Detector.detect() processes images and saves annotations to specified directory.",
  "flows": "Input path -> filesystem read -> Detector.detect() -> save annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistency in path concatenation (`args.input_path` vs `input_path`), but no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward image detection script that validates input, processes images or directories, and saves annotations. No network activity, credential handling, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The external Detector class's behavior is unknown, but based on this code, no malicious activity is indicated. The only technical issue is a variable inconsistency in path joining, which does not impact security but should be corrected for robustness. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low (0 and ~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard image detection utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment. Minor code correction is recommended for variable consistency, but overall security posture is very low risk.",
