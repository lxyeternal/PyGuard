{
  "purpose": "The script runs object detection using a YOLO model on a specified image or folder of images, saving annotations to an output directory.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'input_path' argument provided via command-line, which can be a file or directory. The code reads this path from user input and filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output annotations to a directory named based on the input filename, using 'os.makedirs' and 'detector.detect'. It also prints processing status and error messages.",
  "flows": "Input path (user-provided argument) -> filesystem checks -> detector.detect calls -> outputs saved in specified directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. The code dynamically loads a model based on a user-supplied string, but only from a predefined set of options. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard argument parsing, input validation, and file handling. The Detector class is imported from a local module, and its detect method is called with user-specified parameters. No malicious network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration routines are evident. The only potentially sensitive action is reading a filesystem path and saving output, which is typical for such applications. No suspicious patterns such as hidden backdoors, credential leaks, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign object detection utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly validates input paths and processes images accordingly. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
