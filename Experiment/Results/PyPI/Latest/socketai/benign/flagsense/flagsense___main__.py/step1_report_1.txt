{
  "purpose": "The script runs YOLO object detection on specified images or folders of images, using a configurable model.",
  "sources": "Reads input_path from command-line arguments, potentially reading files from the filesystem, and user input for model selection.",
  "sinks": "Calls detector.detect() which likely processes images; no direct data sink in this code, but detector operations may involve file I/O and model inference.",
  "flows": "Input path from command-line → directory or file processing → detector.detect() processing images → saving annotations to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad list of model choices, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or obfuscated code are evident. No network operations or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line inputs to process images via a Detector class, saving annotations to a directory. It employs standard practices for file handling, argument parsing, and exception management. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No sensitive data, credentials, or system manipulation features are apparent. The usage of Detector is external, and its behavior is unknown, but the script itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward image processing utility with no evident malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
