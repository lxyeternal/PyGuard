{
  "purpose": "This script runs YOLO object detection models on input images or directories of images, generating annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads input path from command-line arguments; uses 'argparse' to process model choice and verbose flag; reads files from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Reads image files from filesystem; invokes Detector.detect() which likely processes images and saves annotations to disk.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> filesystem access to read images -> Detector.detect() processing and saving annotations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and a Detector class; no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script uses command-line arguments for input path and model selection, then initializes a Detector object with the chosen model. It processes either a single image or all images in a directory, saving annotations. The code appears to perform typical image detection tasks without any unusual data flow or hidden actions. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only external interaction is filesystem I/O and invoking an external Detector class, whose implementation isn't provided, but its usage here seems straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script for image detection tasks with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely processes images, saves annotations, and does not exhibit any signs of malware or malicious supply chain compromises.",
