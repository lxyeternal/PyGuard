{
  "purpose": "This code imports the Detector class from a local module yolo_inference, likely for object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module .yolo_inference to access the Detector class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports a class without further data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a class, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The import appears standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. Given the simplicity, the code cannot be malicious by itself. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis. No further action or suspicion is warranted based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
