  "purpose": "Import the Detector class from the yolo_inference module, likely for object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing Detector from yolo_inference module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable from the single import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors present in this minimal snippet",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement from a relative module yolo_inference, importing the Detector class. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import could be part of a larger project focused on object detection using YOLO architecture. Without additional context or code, there are no security concerns or suspicious activities identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement for a Detector class from a local module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet.",
