{
  "purpose": "Import the Detector class from the yolo_inference module, likely for performing object detection using YOLO model.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.yolo_inference'. No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing the Detector class from a local module. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code insertion. Given the minimal content, there is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard part of a larger application for YOLO-based inference.",
