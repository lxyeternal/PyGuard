  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from .yolo_inference import Detector`.\n- There is no additional code, data flow, or context provided.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The import statement is straightforward and standard in Python projects. No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and do not assume malicious intent without evidence. Their reasoning appears sound.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n1. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**  \n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is suggested by an import statement.\n   - Obfuscated = 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation in the code.\n\n2. **Security Risk Score:**  \n   - All reports assign 0, which is appropriate for such a minimal import statement.\n\n3. **Confidence Levels:**  \n   - Mostly 1, with one report at 0.9, reflecting high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the minimal and benign nature of the code, the scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n- **Are the conclusions justified?**  \n  Absolutely. The reasoning is consistent, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  Considering the entire context (a simple import statement), I agree with the assigned scores:  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- **Potential for hidden malicious intent:**  \n  Since the code is just an import, unless additional context suggests otherwise, there's no reason to suspect malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None. The code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected.\n- **Score adjustments:** None needed; current scores are appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores > 0.5:** Not applicable here; the code is clearly safe.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** Should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code snippet poses no security concern.",
