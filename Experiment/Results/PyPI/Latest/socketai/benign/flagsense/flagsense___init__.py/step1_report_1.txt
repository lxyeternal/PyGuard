{
  "purpose": "Importing the Detector class from the yolo_inference module, likely for object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which does not involve reading external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a module import from a relative package, presumably part of a larger project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The presence of 'Detector' suggests use of an object detection model, which is common in computer vision tasks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this isolated import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and standard for importing a class from a module.",
