  "purpose": "Import the Detector class from the yolo_inference module, likely used for object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the yolo_inference module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling in this line.",
  "flows": "N/A - single import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module named yolo_inference, presumably for object detection or inference purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity within this single line. As it is a straightforward import, it doesn't introduce security risks by itself. No obfuscation or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement that appears benign. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on this line alone.",
