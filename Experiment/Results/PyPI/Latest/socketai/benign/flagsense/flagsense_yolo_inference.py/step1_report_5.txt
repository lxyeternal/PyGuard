{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load a YOLO model and perform object detection on an input image, generating annotated images and various annotation formats (YOLO, COCO).",
  "sources": "Reads image data from the filesystem (image_path), loads model files from the package's model directory via importlib.resources, and accesses filesystem paths for saving outputs (save_dir).",
  "sinks": "Writes annotation files (TXT and JSON) to disk, saves annotated images if verbose, and loads models from package resources.",
  "flows": "Image path input -> cv2.imread reading image -> model inference -> results processing -> saves annotations and annotated images to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Model files are loaded from package resources; filenames are fixed strings. No network communication or data exfiltration present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The code appears standard for an object detection pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models from package resources, performs detection, and outputs annotations in multiple formats. It uses standard libraries (cv2, json, os) without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, system damage, or covert data theft. The structure is straightforward and typical for image detection workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate object detection tasks with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It only reads input images, processes them through a model, and outputs annotations and images to disk. There are no suspicious network or system operations. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
