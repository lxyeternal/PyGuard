{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a YOLO object detection model on a specified image, generating annotations in YOLO and COCO formats, and optionally saves annotated images.",
  "sources": "Reads image file from 'image_path' parameter; accesses model files via resources path; uses environment to read image via cv2.imread; reads and writes files for annotations and images.",
  "sinks": "Writes annotation files (.txt, .json), annotated images (.jpg), and saves to user-specified directories.",
  "flows": "Image file path input -> cv2.imread reads image -> results from YOLO model -> annotations generated -> files saved to specified directories.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'resources.path' to access model files, which is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments detected; no network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical object detection workflows: loading a model, processing an image, generating annotation files, and optionally saving annotated images. It uses standard libraries and methods. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections are present. The only operations involve file I/O, image processing, and annotation generation. The use of resource paths for model files is safe and appropriate. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an object detection pipeline using YOLO models. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code’s structure and operations are consistent with legitimate usage, and no malware or security risks are identified.",
