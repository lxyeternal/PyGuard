{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a YOLO model, perform object detection on a specified image, and save annotations in multiple formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input image file via cv2.imread and input image path from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes annotated images, YOLO format annotations, and COCO JSON annotations to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Image path input → cv2.imread; detection results → file writing (annotated images, annotations).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; file paths are constructed from safe sources.",
  "analysis": "The code loads models securely using 'importlib.resources' to access model files within package resources, avoiding hardcoded paths. Detection results are processed and saved locally in organized directories. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious system modifications. The code performs standard object detection and annotation tasks with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate object detection utility using YOLO models, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles files and directories properly and does not contain hidden or malicious code segments.",
