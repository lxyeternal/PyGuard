{
  "purpose": "This code performs object detection on images using YOLO models loaded from package resources, then saves annotated images and various annotation formats locally.",
  "sources": "Image file input, model files loaded via importlib.resources, image data from cv2.imread",
  "sinks": "Writing annotated images, YOLO format text files, COCO JSON annotation files",
  "flows": "Image data read from file -> processed by YOLO model -> results used to generate annotations -> saved to disk",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code loads models securely from package resources, processes images with standard libraries, and saves annotations locally. No network calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. The detection and annotation logic are straightforward and align with typical object detection workflows. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate object detection utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates locally, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any suspicious activities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
