{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a YOLO object detection model and perform detection on a specified image, then save annotated images and various annotation formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input image via cv2.imread(image_path); loads model using resources.path with MODEL_MAP values; reads environment via os.path and os.makedirs; reads from disk and writes annotated images, JSON, and text files.",
  "sinks": "Writes annotated images, YOLO-formatted text files, and COCO JSON annotations to specified directories; no external network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Reads image from disk -> Processes image with model -> Generates annotations -> Saves outputs to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. Uses resources.path to load model files, which is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No data exfiltration or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads models from package resources, performs object detection, and saves annotations and images locally. No user input is directly used in a harmful way, and all file operations are straightforward. The code does not connect to the network, execute system commands, or access sensitive environment variables. The model loading process uses standard resource management without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate object detection utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates locally, processes images, and saves results without external communication or harmful actions.",
