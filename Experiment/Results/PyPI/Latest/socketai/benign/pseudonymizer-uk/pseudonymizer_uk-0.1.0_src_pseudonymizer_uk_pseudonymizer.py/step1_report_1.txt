{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Ukrainian language-specific pseudonymizer using Presidio and spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and anonymization.",
  "sources": "User input text in the 'pseudonymize' method; configuration parameters like 'path_to_model' during initialization; recognition results from Presidio analyzer.",
  "sinks": "Replacement of recognized entities within the input text during pseudonymization; loading of spaCy models from specified paths.",
  "flows": "Input text is analyzed by Presidio analyzer, recognition results are used to replace entities in the text with anonymized data, then the processed text is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of standard Presidio and spaCy components. The model path is user-specified, which is normal but could be misused if pointing to malicious models, though not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Ukrainian language-specific Pseudonymizer leveraging Presidio's capabilities. It loads a spaCy model from a provided path, initializes a recognizer registry, adds standard recognizers (email, credit card, URL, phone) with Ukrainian support, and allows adding custom recognizers and operators. The '_load_model' method loads a spaCy model dynamically, which is standard practice. The 'pseudonymize' method performs analysis and replaces recognized entities with pseudonyms. No evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communications, or backdoors, is present. The code mainly relies on existing libraries and standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a language-specific pseudonymizer for Ukrainian text, with no malicious intent detected. It uses standard libraries and methods for NER and anonymization, and there are no suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads present.",
