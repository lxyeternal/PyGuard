{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer using the Presidio framework, integrating custom NER models and recognizers for data anonymization and pseudonymization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'pseudonymize' method which processes provided text. It also loads a spaCy model from a specified path during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if the anonymized or raw data is transmitted over the network or stored insecurely, but this is outside the scope of the code. No explicit data exfiltration or network communication is present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input text is passed to 'pseudonymize', which analyzes it using Presidio, then applies anonymization operators to replace sensitive entities. The model is loaded from a specified path and used within the analysis process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard Presidio components, loads models from a path, and handles recognized entities with no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Ukrainian-specific NLP engine with a spaCy model loaded from a provided path. It sets up the Presidio RecognizerRegistry with predefined recognizers for email, credit card, URL, and phone, supporting Ukrainian language. It allows adding custom recognizers and operators. The '_load_model' function loads a spaCy model dynamically, and the 'pseudonymize' method analyzes the text and applies anonymization based on the recognized entities. All processes appear to be standard use of the Presidio framework for data privacy tasks. No malicious logic or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a legitimate data pseudonymization process for Ukrainian text using Presidio and spaCy, with support for custom recognizers and operators. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indications. The design appears to be for data privacy purposes, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
