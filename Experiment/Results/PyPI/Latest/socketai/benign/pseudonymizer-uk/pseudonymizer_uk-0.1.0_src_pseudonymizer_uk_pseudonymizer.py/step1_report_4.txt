{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer and named entity recognition system using Presidio and SpaCy, designed to anonymize sensitive data in Ukrainian text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text in the 'pseudonymize' method and loads a SpaCy model from a provided directory path.",
  "sinks": "The anonymizer processes and replaces identified entities; the model loading could potentially be a target for malicious model injection if the source is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input text -> analysis via Presidio analyzer with custom NLP engine -> detection of entities -> replacement via anonymizer -> output text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. The model loading from an external path could be risky if untrusted models are loaded. The code dynamically adds recognizers and operators, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Ukrainian-specific NLP engine using SpaCy and loads a model from a provided path. It sets up Presidio recognizers, including predefined ones for email, credit card, URL, and phone, along with custom recognizers if provided. The analyzer processes text to find sensitive entities, which are then anonymized via replacements. The code does not contain code injection points, data leaks, or malicious system commands. The only potential concern is trusting the model path, which could be exploited if untrusted models are loaded, but this is a standard practice in NLP pipelines. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Ukrainian data pseudonymization tool using Presidio and SpaCy, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. Its structure and functionality are consistent with privacy-preserving data processing workflows.",
