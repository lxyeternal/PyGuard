  "purpose": "A Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer utilizing Presidio analyzer and spaCy for entity recognition and anonymization.",
  "sources": "Model loaded from user-specified path, input text for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Analysis results used to replace entities in the input text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> analyze with Presidio -> identify entities -> replace entities with anonymized data -> output text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Model path is externally specified, which could be a vector if models are malicious, but this is external to the code.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a spaCy model dynamically, sets up a Presidio RecognizerRegistry with standard recognizers plus optional custom recognizers, and performs entity analysis followed by anonymization. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The model loading from an external path is a potential external risk but is standard practice. No obfuscation or code injection detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's structure and external factors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Ukrainian language pseudonymizer leveraging Presidio and spaCy. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary external concern is trusting the model source, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe for use with no inherent security risks.",
