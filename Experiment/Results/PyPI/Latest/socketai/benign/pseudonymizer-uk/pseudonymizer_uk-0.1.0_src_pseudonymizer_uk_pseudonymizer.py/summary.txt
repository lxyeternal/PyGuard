  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Ukrainian language pseudonymizer leveraging Presidio and spaCy. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary external concern is trusting the model source, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe for use with no inherent security risks."
