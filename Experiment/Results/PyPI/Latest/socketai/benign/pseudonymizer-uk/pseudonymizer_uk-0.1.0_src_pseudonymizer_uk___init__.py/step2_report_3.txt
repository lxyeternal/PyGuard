  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initialization: importing a class, defining version info, and setting __all__.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is minimal and typical for a Python package __init__.py file.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirmed: The import statement is correct, and no malicious activity is present.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Confirmed: Same as above, standard module setup.\n- Scores: All zero, consistent.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Confirmed: Standard package initialization.\n- Scores: All zero, consistent.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confirmed: Simple import and export setup.\n- Scores: All zero, consistent.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confirmed: Same as above, straightforward module export.\n- Scores: All zero, consistent.\n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, malware should be scored as 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and not obfuscated; score should be 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since there are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns, the overall security risk should be 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. The code is a standard, harmless module initialization snippet.",
