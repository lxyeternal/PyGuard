{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing a class from a local module, setting version metadata, and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads static definitions (__version__, __all__) and imports a class from a local module (.pseudonymizer). No external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network communication, or execute any dynamic code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only sets module-level variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard import and variable definitions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python package __init__.py file. It imports a class from a local module, defines version info, and specifies exported symbols. There are no data flows, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static, clear, and typical for such modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring reflects this accurately.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
