{
  "purpose": "Exporting the UkPseudonymizer class from the pseudonymizer module and defining package version and public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.pseudonymizer import UkPseudonymizer).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, external communication, or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data; the code only sets package metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The import path is local, and the code is minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, defines version information, and specifies the public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py file, serving as an entry point and API surface. No anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply sets up exports and versioning for the package.",
