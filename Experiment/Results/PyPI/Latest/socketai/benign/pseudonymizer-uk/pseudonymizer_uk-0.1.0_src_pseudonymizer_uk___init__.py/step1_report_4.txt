  "purpose": "Export the UkPseudonymizer class from the pseudonymizer module, likely for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pseudonymizer import UkPseudonymizer; assignment of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, setting versioning and export variables with no suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, defines a version string, and specifies what symbols are exported. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module initialization snippet intended to expose a class for external use. No malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
