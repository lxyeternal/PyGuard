  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: The code is a straightforward import and variable assignment, with no suspicious activity.\n   - **Verdict**: Accurate. The code only imports a class, sets version info, and exports it. No data flow, no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard module setup.\n   - **Verdict**: Correct. No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Again, a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Verdict**: Valid. The code is minimal and standard.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Verdict**: Correct.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same conclusion, benign module setup.\n   - **Verdict**: Accurate.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence**: The actual code provided is just an import statement, version string, and export list. There are no data flows, no external network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign malware=0, which is correct given the code. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk.\n- The code is a typical module initialization file with no security concerns.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, and all reports correctly identify it as such. The scores reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code and no security risks.",
