{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ identification numbers within the Presidio security framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the presidio_analyzer.pattern_recognizer and presidio_analyzer.pattern modules, which are used to define pattern-based recognition logic.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution calls present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining pattern objects with regexes, assigning context, and initializing a class that registers these patterns for recognizing Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve a benign purpose. There are no unusual code constructs or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with specified patterns to identify Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers using regex. It includes context for better recognition within relevant text. The implementation appears standard for a pattern-based recognizer without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, pattern-based recognizer designed for a specific identification task within Presidio. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
