{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom pattern recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ identification numbers within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the presidio_analyzer.pattern_recognizer and presidio_analyzer.pattern modules, but does not execute or process any data inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within this code itself; it merely defines a class with patterns and context.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward subclass definition with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides pattern definitions for recognizing Ukrainian registration numbers within the Presidio security framework. It imports necessary classes, defines patterns with regular expressions, and specifies contextual keywords. There are no data processing or external inputs handled directly in this code snippet. The patterns are static regexes designed for pattern matching, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data fetching, command execution, or other potentially dangerous actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign extension of the Presidio framework, intended for pattern recognition of specific Ukrainian identification numbers. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
