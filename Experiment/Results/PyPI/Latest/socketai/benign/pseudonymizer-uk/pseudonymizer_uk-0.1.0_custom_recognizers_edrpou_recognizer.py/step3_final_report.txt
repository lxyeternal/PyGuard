{
  "purpose": "Recognize Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ (business registration) numbers, either as 8 digits or with specific prefixes, within text.",
  "sources": "Text input where patterns like 8-digit numbers or prefixed forms (e.g., 'ЄДРПОУ 12345678') are present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none; the code only performs pattern matching without external data handling or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex patterns matching specific number formats -> recognition output.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, static regex-based pattern recognition with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer with static regex patterns for Ukrainian business identifiers. Patterns are simple and static, matching either 8 digits or prefixed forms with relevant keywords. No dynamic execution, external data, or network activity is present. The code is well-structured, purpose-specific, and free of suspicious or malicious logic. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low or zero security risk scores. The only minor inconsistency is in one report assigning a securityRisk of 0.1, which is overly cautious given the code's simplicity. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static pattern recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and risk. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
