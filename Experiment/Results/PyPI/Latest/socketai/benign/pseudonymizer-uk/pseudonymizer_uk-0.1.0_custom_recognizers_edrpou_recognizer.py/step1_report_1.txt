{
  "purpose": "Define a custom recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources, user input, or network operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines patterns for recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The patterns are straightforward regex matches for Ukrainian identification numbers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer, specifying regex patterns to identify Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers, with associated context for better recognition. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or potentially malicious code is present. The patterns are static regexes, and the class serves a purely functional purpose within a larger system. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom recognizer for a specific data format, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
