{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers within the Presidio security framework, aiming to identify specific patterns related to Ukrainian business registration numbers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input text where it searches for patterns matching Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers and related contextual keywords.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data to perform actions like executing commands, writing to files, or network communication. The code only defines patterns and does not perform such operations.",
  "flows": "The recognizer takes input text as a source, applies regex patterns to identify specific patterns, and potentially outputs recognized entities. No data is transmitted, stored, or acted upon in a malicious way.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior, are present. The code appears to be straightforward pattern recognition logic, with clear regex definitions and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Presidio for pattern recognition, defines specific regex patterns for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers, and specifies contextual keywords for improved recognition. The patterns are regex-based and do not involve any external inputs or insecure handling. No suspicious or malicious code segments are detected. The structure is typical for a custom recognizer, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a custom pattern recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers within the Presidio framework. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and it appears to be a benign, purpose-specific extension.",
