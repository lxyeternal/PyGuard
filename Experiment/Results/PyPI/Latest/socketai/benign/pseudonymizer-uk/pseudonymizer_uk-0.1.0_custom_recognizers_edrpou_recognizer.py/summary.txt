  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static pattern recognizer for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ numbers, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and risk. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
