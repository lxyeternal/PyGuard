  "purpose": "Recognizer class for Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ identification within Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "Pattern definitions in the PATTERNS list and context terms in the CONTEXT list.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; pattern matching is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer with static regex patterns for recognizing Ukrainian ЄДРПОУ codes. Patterns are simple regexes for matching eight digits with optional prefixes. No external inputs, network operations, or data manipulations occur. The class structure and pattern definitions are straightforward and conform to typical usage of the Presidio framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a pattern recognizer for specific Ukrainian identification codes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
