{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer using Presidio's NLP and anonymization tools, with custom recognizers and a spaCy model for NER.",
  "sources": "Code reads the path to a spaCy model, and uses this model for NER; also reads text input for pseudonymization.",
  "sinks": "The analyze and anonymize methods process potentially untrusted text input; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Text input -> NER analysis -> entity detection -> replacement via anonymizer.",
  "anomalies": "The code loads a spaCy model dynamically; no hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Custom recognizers and operators are added but without evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a Ukrainian NLP and pseudonymization pipeline using Presidio and spaCy, with custom recognizers and operators. It loads a model from a given path, initializes the analyzer and anonymizer, and performs entity recognition and anonymization on input text. No external network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to data anonymization. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or behaviors indicative of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Ukrainian language pseudonymizer using Presidio and spaCy, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, purpose-built component for privacy-preserving data processing.",
