{
  "purpose": "A Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer utilizing Presidio and spaCy for entity recognition and anonymization.",
  "sources": "Model loading from a specified path, input text analysis for entity detection.",
  "sinks": "Entity recognition results used internally for pseudonymization; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> analysis via Presidio analyzer -> entity detection -> anonymization and replacement -> output text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a spaCy model dynamically, sets up a Presidio RecognizerRegistry with standard and custom recognizers, performs entity analysis, and replaces entities with pseudonyms. It operates solely within the scope of data anonymization, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a Ukrainian data pseudonymizer. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
