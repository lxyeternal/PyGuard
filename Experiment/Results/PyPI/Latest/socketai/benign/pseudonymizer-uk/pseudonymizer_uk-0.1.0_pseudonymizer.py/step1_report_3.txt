{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer and NER engine using the Presidio framework and spaCy, to identify and anonymize sensitive data in Ukrainian text.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the input parameter 'text' in pseudonymize(), and the spaCy model loaded from the provided 'path_to_model'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs data processing and replacement within the 'pseudonymize' method, with no external data sinks, network connections, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is analyzed via Presidio's analyzer to identify entities, then entities are replaced (pseudonymized) in the text during 'pseudonymize' method, with potential modification via custom operators.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code uses standard libraries and well-known frameworks. The model path is a required argument, which is normal for loading models.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a spaCy model and integrates it with Presidio for entity recognition tailored to Ukrainian. It sets up recognizers for common sensitive data types and allows custom recognizers and operators. The process involves loading a model, configuring recognizers, performing analysis, and replacing recognized entities. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious external communications, or obfuscated code. All functions are related to data processing and anonymization, with appropriate use of libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Ukrainian data pseudonymizer using Presidio and spaCy, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected tasks without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
