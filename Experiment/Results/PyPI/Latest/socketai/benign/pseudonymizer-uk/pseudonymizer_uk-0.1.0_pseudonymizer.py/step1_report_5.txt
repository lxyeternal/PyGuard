{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for Ukrainian language named entity recognition and pseudonymization using Presidio and spaCy, with custom recognizers and operators.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (spacy, presidio_analyzer, presidio_anonymizer), loading of spaCy model from a provided path, and analysis of input text in pseudonymize method.",
  "sinks": "Analysis results processed in the pseudonymize method, involving replacement of entities within the text; no external data sinks or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into analyze() method of Presidio Analyzer, which identifies entities. The results are then used to replace entities via the anonymizer, producing pseudonymized text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies; the code appears to correctly implement language-specific entity recognition and pseudonymization. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads a spaCy model, sets up a Presidio RecognizerRegistry with predefined and custom recognizers, and initializes an AnalyzerEngine for Ukrainian text. The pseudonymization process analyzes input text for entities and replaces them with pseudonyms. The code structure is standard for such tasks, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communications, or backdoors. The code primarily performs data processing within controlled methods, with no external or unsafe operations beyond loading models and processing text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Ukrainian language entity recognition and pseudonymization, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions using well-known libraries, with proper handling of custom recognizers and operators. No malware or security issues identified.",
