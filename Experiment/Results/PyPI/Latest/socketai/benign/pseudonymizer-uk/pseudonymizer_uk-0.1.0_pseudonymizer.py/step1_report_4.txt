{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer using the Presidio framework, spaCy models, and predefined recognizers to identify and pseudonymize sensitive entities in text.",
  "sources": "Code loads a spaCy model from a provided path, initializes recognizers and analyzers, and processes input text to identify entities.",
  "sinks": "The pseudonymize method processes input text and produces an anonymized output; no external sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input text is analyzed by the Presidio analyzer, which identifies entities; these entities are then replaced via the anonymizer, producing the output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network activities are present. The code uses standard libraries and known frameworks without obfuscation or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, sets up a custom spaCy NLP engine for Ukrainian, and constructs a Presidio analyzer with additional recognizers. The class initializes models securely from a provided path, and the pseudonymization process involves standard analysis and anonymization steps. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. No external network communications or system modifications are performed. The structure and methods are typical for a privacy-preserving NLP application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Ukrainian text pseudonymizer using Presidio, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles sensitive data responsibly by anonymizing identified entities. There are no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
