{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Ukrainian-specific pseudonymizer using the Presidio library, spaCy, and custom recognizers and operators to identify and anonymize sensitive information in Ukrainian text.",
  "sources": "Loading spaCy model from a provided path, reading input text in the pseudonymize method.",
  "sinks": "Applying Presidio analysis and anonymization functions, potentially modifying or exposing data during anonymization process.",
  "flows": "Input text → analysis via Presidio (with custom recognizers and model) → processing analysis results → anonymization and replacement of entities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of standard Presidio and spaCy functions. The code dynamically loads models and adds recognizers but does not perform any suspicious or unauthorized network operations or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a custom spaCy NLP engine for Ukrainian language, configures a Presidio RecognizerRegistry with standard and custom recognizers, and sets up an analyzer and anonymizer. The model is loaded from a user-specified path, and the process involves standard text analysis and pseudonymization. No code injection, external network communication, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. The functionality appears to be straightforward and aligned with legitimate data anonymization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a Ukrainian data pseudonymizer using Presidio and spaCy, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs legitimate operations—loading models, analyzing text, and replacing entities. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
