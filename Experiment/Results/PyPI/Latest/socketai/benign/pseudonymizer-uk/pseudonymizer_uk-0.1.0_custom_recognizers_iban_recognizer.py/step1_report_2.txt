{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to define a custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs within the Presidio framework, to identify and extract Ukrainian bank account numbers from text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the regex patterns defined in the PATTERNS list; these patterns are used to match IBAN strings in the text.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; however, if the recognized IBANs are subsequently used without validation, there could be downstream risks, but this code itself does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the patterns for recognition; matched IBANs could then be used elsewhere in the system for validation, storage, or processing, but this code only defines recognition patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code straightforwardly defines regex patterns and a class constructor without any suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'UkrIbanRecognizer' inheriting from 'PatternRecognizer' with specific regex patterns for Ukrainian IBANs. Patterns are well-formed, targeting specific IBAN formats, and the class initializes with relevant parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. No external data handling, network communication, or secret management occurs. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a text analysis framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs within the Presidio library. No malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks are evident.",
