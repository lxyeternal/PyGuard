  "purpose": "A custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs to be used in Presidio for entity recognition.",
  "sources": "The class and its patterns are defined within the code; no external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines patterns for recognition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code's flow is limited to pattern matching setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The patterns are straightforward regex for IBAN recognition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends PatternRecognizer to identify Ukrainian IBANs using specific regex patterns. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or credential handling is present. It utilizes the Presidio framework as intended for pattern recognition. No indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are found. The code is clean, well-structured, and performs a benign pattern matching task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pattern recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as part of a larger framework to identify specific financial identifiers without any suspicious activity.",
