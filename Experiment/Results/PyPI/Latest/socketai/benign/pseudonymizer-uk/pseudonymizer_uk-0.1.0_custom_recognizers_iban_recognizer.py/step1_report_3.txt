{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs to be used within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'presidio_analyzer' library; class attributes defining regex patterns; the constructor method initializing the recognizer.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data inputs, no data writes, no network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily defines static patterns and a class constructor with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns or code structures. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The regex patterns are straightforward for IBAN recognition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from the Presidio analyzer library, defines regex patterns for Ukrainian IBAN formats, and creates a recognizer class. The patterns are simple regexes without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The class constructor properly initializes the recognizer with its supported entity, patterns, name, and language. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, network operations, or data leaks. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, purpose-specific recognizer implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Ukrainian IBAN recognizer for Presidio, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
