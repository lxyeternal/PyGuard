  "purpose": "Pattern recognition for Ukrainian IBANs using regex patterns within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns matching Ukrainian IBAN formats, class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching from input text to recognition output; no external data flow or malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending PatternRecognizer with two regex patterns for Ukrainian IBANs, set within a static class structure. It includes context hints and proper initialization. No external data handling, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The regex patterns are simple and targeted, matching standard IBAN formats. The code is purpose-specific, well-structured, and free of suspicious or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, and the confidence score of 1 is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built pattern recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports accurately assess its safety, and no adjustments are necessary.",
