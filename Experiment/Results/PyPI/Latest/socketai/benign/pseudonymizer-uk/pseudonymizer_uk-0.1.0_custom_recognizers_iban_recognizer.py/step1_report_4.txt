{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs for use in Presidio.",
  "sources": "Imports from presidio_analyzer.pattern_recognizer and presidio_analyzer.pattern; class variables and methods; regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of patterns and context in the class, which are then used by the superclass for recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines regex patterns for recognizing Ukrainian IBANs, and sets context hints. The patterns are straightforward regex matches, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external network calls. The class is a standard extension of a Presidio recognizer with no modifications that would indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
