{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian IBANs within the Presidio security framework, aimed at identifying IBANs in text data.",
  "sources": "The class initialization and pattern definitions, specifically the regex patterns for Ukrainian IBANs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no system or network calls, no file operations, no environment variable access.",
  "flows": "The code compiles regex patterns for input text analysis; there are no data flows involving untrusted data leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the regex patterns are straightforward, with no obfuscated or dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes from presido_analyzer, defines a subclass for Ukrainian IBAN recognition with two regex patterns for compact and spaced formats, and specifies context hints. The patterns appear to be standard regex for IBAN formats without any malicious components. The class constructor properly initializes the superclass with the provided patterns and settings. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent are evident. The code functions solely to recognize specific patterns in text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, pattern-based recognizer implementation for Ukrainian IBANs with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
