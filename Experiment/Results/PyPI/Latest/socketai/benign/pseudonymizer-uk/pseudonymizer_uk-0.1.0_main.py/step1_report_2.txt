{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates usage of pseudonymization and anonymization tools for sensitive Ukrainian text, specifically masking personal data and adding custom recognizers and operators.",
  "sources": "Input text containing personal identifiers and potentially sensitive data, such as tax IDs and names.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed to the console after pseudonymization, which could be considered a data leakage point if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "Input text → pseudonymizer.pseudonymize() → processed output displayed via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for pseudonymization workflows; no suspicious or unusual code constructs. The addition of custom recognizers and operators is a legitimate extension, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports legitimate libraries for pseudonymization (presidio) and custom recognizers. It creates an instance of UkPseudonymizer, processes Ukrainian personal data, and applies custom recognizers and operators, including replacing entities with placeholders. No code injections, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code’s behavior is consistent with data anonymization tasks; no network communications, file manipulations, or hidden actions are present. Overall, the script appears safe, focusing on data masking workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate pseudonymization and anonymization operations without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It utilizes known libraries for data masking and custom recognizers in a typical manner. There are no indications of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or security breaches.",
