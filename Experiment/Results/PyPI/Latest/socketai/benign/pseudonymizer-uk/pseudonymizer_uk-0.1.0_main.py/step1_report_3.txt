{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of a pseudonymizer for anonymizing Ukrainian personal data, with customization options for operators and recognizers.",
  "sources": "Input text containing personal identifiers, such as ID numbers and names.",
  "sinks": "Pseudonymized output where sensitive information is replaced or masked.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through the pseudonymizer, which applies recognition and replacement rules to produce anonymized text.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses custom recognizers and operators without any obfuscation or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No data leaks or network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules related to pseudonymization and recognition, then creates an instance of UkPseudonymizer. It processes a Ukrainian text containing personal data, applying default pseudonymization, custom operator replacements, and custom recognizers for Ukrainian tax IDs. All operations are within standard pseudonymization workflows. No suspicious code, data exfiltration, or malware behavior is observed. The code performs straightforward anonymization tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical pseudonymization of personal data with customization options. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and intended for data anonymization purposes.",
