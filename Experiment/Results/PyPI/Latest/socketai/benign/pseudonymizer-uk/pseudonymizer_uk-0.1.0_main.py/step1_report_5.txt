{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the usage of a pseudonymization library to anonymize sensitive text data, including applying default, custom masking, and custom recognizer functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input text data from a string variable containing Ukrainian personal and legal information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are printed to the console; no data is written to external systems or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through methods pseudonymize() with various customizations; data flows from source string to pseudonymization functions and finally to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of custom recognizer and operator configurations appears standard. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific pseudonymization libraries and custom recognizers, then applies pseudonymization with default settings, custom masking for 'PERSON' entities, and a custom recognizer for Ukrainian tax IDs. No unsafe or malicious behaviors are present. No external network connections, data leaks, or suspicious operations are observed. The code strictly performs data anonymization locally and outputs results to the console, aligned with expected behavior for such an application.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward implementation of data pseudonymization using a specialized library with custom extensions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
