{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates Ukrainian personal data pseudonymization using the pseudonymizer library, with custom recognizers and operators.",
  "sources": "Reads input text containing personal identifiers and tax IDs, primarily from a string variable.",
  "sinks": "Outputs pseudonymized text to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed by the pseudonymizer, which applies recognition and masking, then results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pseudonymization with extension points for custom recognizers and operators. It processes data locally, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The use of custom recognizers and operators is typical for enhancing recognition accuracy. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The print statements could expose sensitive data if logs are insecure, but this is a common practice in testing and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of data pseudonymization with custom extensions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
