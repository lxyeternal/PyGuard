{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of a pseudonymizer class to anonymize sensitive data in Ukrainian text, including adding custom operators and recognizers for specific entity types.",
  "sources": "Input text containing personal identifiers, such as ID numbers and names, which are read from a string variable.",
  "sinks": "Printing results to the console; no external data sinks, network connections, or file operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through the pseudonymizer, which applies default, custom operator, and custom recognizer transformations, then outputs the results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code uses standard library imports and straightforward method calls. The custom recognizer and operator additions are typical for extending functionality and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a pseudonymizer and processes a Ukrainian text containing personal identifiers. It demonstrates typical usage: creating instances, adding custom operators for replacing entities, and adding a custom recognizer for Ukrainian tax IDs. All actions are consistent with data anonymization purposes. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code constructs are present. The code structure appears standard, with no obfuscation or hidden functionalities. The operations are transparent, and the data handling is limited to local processing and printing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data pseudonymization for Ukrainian personal data using a pseudonymizer, with extensions for custom recognition and replacement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data leaks, or malware. It is a standard anonymization script with no security risks detected.",
