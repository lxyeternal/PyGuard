{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of a pseudonymizer to mask sensitive data within Ukrainian legal text, including the addition of custom recognizers and operators for specific identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input text containing personal identifiers, tax ID numbers, and potentially sensitive legal information.",
  "sinks": "Output of pseudonymized text, which replaces original data with masked or generic values.",
  "flows": "Text is processed through pseudonymizer.pseudonymize(), with data flowing from input text to output text, possibly through custom recognizers and operators.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code primarily performs data masking. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports established pseudonymization libraries and a custom recognizer, then performs multiple pseudonymization processes on legal text containing personal data. It adds custom operators and recognizers to enhance data masking. All operations are straightforward, aimed at data privacy. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious intent. The code structure is standard, with clear function definitions and usage. There are no signs of malware or malicious payloads. The code is consistent with privacy-preserving practices and does not exhibit any security risks beyond normal processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data pseudonymization for sensitive Ukrainian legal documents. It uses legitimate libraries and custom recognizers for privacy, with no indications of malicious intent or security threats.",
