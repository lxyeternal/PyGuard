{
  "purpose": "Recognizes Ukrainian Tax ID numbers within text for use with Presidio.",
  "sources": "Input text data processed by the PatternRecognizer class, primarily through regex pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating data leaks or external communication; pattern matching results are likely used internally.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Pattern matching via regex patterns -> Recognized entities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Patterns and context are straightforward and legitimate for the intended purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class UkrTaxIdRecognizer inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with predefined regex patterns to detect Ukrainian Tax IDs. It uses standard regex matching without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network calls. No hidden or malicious code structures are present. The patterns are consistent with the purpose of identifying tax IDs, and the class initialization is straightforward, calling the superclass constructor with appropriate parameters. Overall, the code appears to be a typical pattern recognition module with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured pattern recognizer for Ukrainian Tax IDs with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
