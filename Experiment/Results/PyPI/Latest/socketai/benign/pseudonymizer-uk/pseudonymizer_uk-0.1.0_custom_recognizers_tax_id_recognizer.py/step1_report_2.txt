{
  "purpose": "Define a Ukrainian Tax ID recognizer for Presidio to identify specific tax identification patterns in text.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines patterns for internal recognition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely establishes regex patterns and context for recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward pattern recognition logic with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from presidio_analyzer, defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, and specifies regex patterns for Ukrainian Tax IDs. These patterns are standard regular expressions intended for pattern matching. The class constructor sets up the recognizer with specified patterns, context, language, and entity support. There are no external data reads, network operations, or security-sensitive functions involved. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian Tax IDs within the Presidio framework. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
