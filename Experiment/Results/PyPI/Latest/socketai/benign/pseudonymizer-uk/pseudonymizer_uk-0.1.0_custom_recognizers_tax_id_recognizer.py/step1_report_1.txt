{
  "purpose": "Define a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian Tax IDs (ІПН / РНОКПП) within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'presidio_analyzer.pattern_recognizer' and 'presidio_analyzer.pattern'; class definitions and regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code primarily defines patterns for recognition and does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Imports and class initialization flow, setting patterns and context for recognition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard for pattern recognition. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class 'UkrTaxIdRecognizer' inheriting from 'PatternRecognizer', and specifies regex patterns for Ukrainian Tax IDs. The patterns include matching 10 digits with optional prefixes and various Ukrainian tax-related terms. The class initialization properly sets the supported entity, patterns, context, name, and language. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian Tax IDs, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and standard for its purpose.",
