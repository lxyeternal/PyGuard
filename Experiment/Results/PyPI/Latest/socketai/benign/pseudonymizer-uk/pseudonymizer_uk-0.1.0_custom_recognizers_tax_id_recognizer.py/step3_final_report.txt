  "purpose": "Pattern recognition for Ukrainian Tax IDs (ІПН / РНОКПП) using regex patterns within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns matching 10-digit numbers, prefixed forms, and Ukrainian tax-related terms in text.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code only performs pattern matching without external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input text is matched against regex patterns to identify Ukrainian Tax IDs; no data is transferred elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static regex patterns and straightforward class structure, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with static regex patterns for Ukrainian Tax IDs. It includes no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network calls. The patterns are clear and purpose-specific. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to false positives, but not security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven pattern recognizer for Ukrainian Tax IDs with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the scoring accurately reflects this. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its intended use.",
