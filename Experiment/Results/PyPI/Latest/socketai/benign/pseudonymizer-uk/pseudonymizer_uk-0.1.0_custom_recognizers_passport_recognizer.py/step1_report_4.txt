{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian passports based on specific regex patterns using the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when the recognizer processes text documents; specifically, it scans for patterns matching Ukrainian passports.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process or transmit data, as this code only defines pattern recognition logic.",
  "flows": "Input text is matched against regex patterns to identify passport numbers, with no data being sent or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The regex patterns are straightforward for passport formats.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Presidio modules to create a custom recognizer. It defines regex patterns for Ukrainian passports, with one pattern recognizing basic format and another recognizing formats with prefixes. The patterns are simple regex matching specific characters and digits. No external inputs or outputs are processed beyond pattern matching. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the code solely implements pattern recognition logic as intended. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward pattern recognizer for Ukrainian passports using Presidio. It appears legitimate and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It effectively defines patterns for passport recognition without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
