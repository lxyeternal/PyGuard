  "purpose": "Define a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian passports for use in Presidio's entity analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes (PATTERNS), context list, constructor method",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily defines patterns and configuration for recognition",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data at runtime beyond pattern definitions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Patterns are straightforward regex for passport formats.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer for recognizing Ukrainian passports with specific regex patterns. It includes a basic pattern and a more specific pattern with prefixes. The context list aids in recognition. No user input handling, network operations, or data exfiltration logic present. The patterns are simple regex and do not pose security risks. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code appears to be a standard configuration for pattern recognition within Presidio.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pattern recognition class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
