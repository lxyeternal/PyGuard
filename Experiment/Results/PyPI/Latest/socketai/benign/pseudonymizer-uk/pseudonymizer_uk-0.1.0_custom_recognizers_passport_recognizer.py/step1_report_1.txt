  "purpose": "A pattern recognizer for Ukrainian passports to identify passport numbers in text.",
  "sources": "Input text data where Ukrainian passport numbers may appear.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching functions within the Presidio framework; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Pattern recognition regex matching -> Recognition output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Patterns are straightforward regexes for known passport formats. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer to identify Ukrainian passport numbers. It uses regex patterns to match passport formats, including a basic pattern and a pattern with a prefix. Context cues are provided for improved recognition. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond pattern matching. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The patterns are standard and directly related to the task. Overall, the code is a typical implementation of a regex-based recognizer with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign pattern recognizer for Ukrainian passports with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
