  "purpose": "Recognize Ukrainian passports based on specific regex patterns for passport numbers and prefixes.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns matching passport formats and context list for recognition cues.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; pattern matching is purely local.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into regex pattern matching, with no external data or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with simple regex patterns and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer with two regex patterns for Ukrainian passports, including context cues. Patterns are simple, targeted, and do not involve external data, network calls, or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is benign, purpose-specific, and safe. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with the code's nature. No logical flaws or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured pattern recognizer for Ukrainian passports with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
