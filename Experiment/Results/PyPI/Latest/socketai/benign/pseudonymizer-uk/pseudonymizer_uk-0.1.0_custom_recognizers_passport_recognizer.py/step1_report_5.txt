  "purpose": "To recognize Ukrainian passports based on specific patterns in text.",
  "sources": "Pattern regex definitions for Ukrainian passport formats",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "Regex patterns match input text to recognize passport formats; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern definitions, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with regex patterns for identifying Ukrainian passports. Patterns include basic and prefix variants, with associated context terms. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of pattern-based recognition for Ukrainian passports. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.",
