{
  "purpose": "To recognize Ukrainian Passport numbers in text using predefined regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input text where the passport data may appear; regex patterns matching passport formats.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is processed into sensitive actions or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex pattern matching -> recognition output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Patterns are straightforward regexes for specific formats. No dynamic code execution, network access, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer to identify Ukrainian passports with specific regex patterns. The patterns are simple and targeted, matching common passport formats with no external data sources or side effects. No suspicious or malicious code is evident, and the context and purpose are clear. The patterns are safe and serve a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate recognizer for Ukrainian passports with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses simple, well-defined regex patterns to identify passport numbers, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
