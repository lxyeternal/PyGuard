  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the code's static and safe nature."
