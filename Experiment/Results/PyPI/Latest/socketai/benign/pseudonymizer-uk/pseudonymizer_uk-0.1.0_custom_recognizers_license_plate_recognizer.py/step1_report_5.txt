{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom license plate recognizer for Ukrainian license plates, extending a pattern recognizer class to identify specific regex patterns in text.",
  "sources": "The code reads pattern definitions for license plates within the PATTERNS list and during class instantiation, it may also process input data via the PatternRecognizer base class (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process untrusted input directly; it only defines regex patterns. The actual input processing and potential data flows depend on the wider framework's usage.",
  "flows": "Input text is matched against regex patterns; however, no direct source-to-sink data flow is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The regex patterns are straightforward, matching license plate formats. No suspicious code constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a PatternRecognizer to recognize Ukrainian license plates using specific regex patterns. The regex patterns are designed to match Ukrainian license plates with Latin and Cyrillic characters, including optional spaces. The class constructor calls the superclass constructor with predefined patterns and metadata. No external data processing, network calls, or insecure practices are present. The patterns are static and intended for recognition purposes only. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate extension of a pattern recognition framework for license plates, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It relies on standard regex patterns and class inheritance without suspicious behavior.",
