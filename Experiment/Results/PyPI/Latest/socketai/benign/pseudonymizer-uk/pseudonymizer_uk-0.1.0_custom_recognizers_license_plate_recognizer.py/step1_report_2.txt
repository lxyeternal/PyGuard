{
  "purpose": "Define a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates, supporting Latin and Cyrillic characters.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input are read; patterns are predefined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could leak or modify data; the code only defines patterns for recognition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; pattern recognition is static and within the framework.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The patterns are straightforward regular expressions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with two patterns for Ukrainian license plates. Regular expressions are used to match specific formats, including Latin and Cyrillic characters. No external inputs, data manipulation, or network activity are present. The code appears to be a typical pattern recognizer component without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pattern recognizer implementation for Ukrainian license plates, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
