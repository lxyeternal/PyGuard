{
  "purpose": "Define a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates, supporting Latin and Cyrillic characters with specific formatting.",
  "sources": "The regex patterns used to match license plates, which are hardcoded within the PATTERNS list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (license plate strings) is matched against regex patterns within the patterns list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; patterns are static regex definitions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a PatternRecognizer class and defines a subclass for Ukrainian license plates, specifying two regex patterns for matching plates with Latin or Cyrillic characters. The patterns are standard regexes for string matching, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The constructor initializes the recognizer with supported entity and language. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and poses no security risks. The code is well-structured and appears safe.",
