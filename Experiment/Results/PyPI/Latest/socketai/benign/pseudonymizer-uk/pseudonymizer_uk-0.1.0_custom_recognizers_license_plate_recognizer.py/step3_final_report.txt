  "purpose": "Pattern recognition for Ukrainian license plates supporting Latin and Cyrillic characters using regex patterns.",
  "sources": "The regex patterns defined within the Pattern class for matching license plates.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines patterns and does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The patterns are used to match input strings; no data flows to external sinks or systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer with two regex patterns to identify Ukrainian license plates. The patterns are static, supporting Latin and Cyrillic characters with optional spaces. The class constructor correctly initializes the recognizer with these patterns. There are no external data sources, network calls, or data sinks. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The regex patterns are simple and designed solely for pattern matching, with no dynamic code execution or external dependencies. Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the code's static and safe nature.",
