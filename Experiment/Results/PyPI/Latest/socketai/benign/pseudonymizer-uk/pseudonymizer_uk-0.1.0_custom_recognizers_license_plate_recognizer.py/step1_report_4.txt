{
  "purpose": "Define a custom pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates, supporting Latin and Cyrillic characters with specific formats.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the 'presidio_analyzer' package, defines patterns with regex for license plate matching, and initializes class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that process untrusted external data; the code primarily defines static patterns.",
  "flows": "The code flows from pattern definitions to class initialization, with no dynamic data handling or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. The regex patterns are straightforward for license plate formats.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer for recognizing Ukrainian license plates using regex patterns. It does not execute external commands, handle sensitive data, or perform network operations. Patterns are static and focused on matching license plates with Latin and Cyrillic characters. The code structure and content are standard for a custom recognizer and contain no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian license plates. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
