{
  "purpose": "To recognize Ukrainian car license plates using pattern matching within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pattern definitions for license plate recognition from regex patterns defined in the PATTERNS list.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any untrusted data sinks; it mainly defines patterns for recognition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code simply sets up pattern matching rules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The regex patterns correctly identify license plates without obfuscation or malicious code. No network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PatternRecognizer to identify Ukrainian license plates using regex patterns. Patterns are straightforward regex matching plates with Latin or Cyrillic characters. No input/output handling, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears standard for pattern recognition within Presidio and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern recognizer implementation for license plates, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purpose-specific.",
