{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to define a custom recognizer for identifying Ukrainian military units in text using specific regex patterns within the Presidio framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the regex patterns applied to text for matching military unit identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data for harmful effects; the code only performs pattern matching.",
  "flows": "The source is input text; the flow is through regex matching within the patterns to identify military unit mentions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only defines patterns for recognition without any suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer to recognize Ukrainian military units via multiple regex patterns. These patterns are standard regex constructs for matching specific formats like 'в/ч A1234' or '2837' in context with keywords. The class initialization sets supported entities and context, with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be a legitimate pattern recognizer designed for entity detection within text and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a pattern recognizer for Ukrainian military units. It only contains regex patterns and class setup for entity recognition without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
