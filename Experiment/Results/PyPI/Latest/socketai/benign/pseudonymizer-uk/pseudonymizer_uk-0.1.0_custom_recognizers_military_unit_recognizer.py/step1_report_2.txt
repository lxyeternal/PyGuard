{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom recognizer for Ukrainian military units within the Presidio security framework, aimed at identifying specific patterns related to military identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code sources input data via the 'Pattern' objects' regex patterns and the 'CONTEXT' list which contains keywords.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process or output untrusted data or perform actions based on the input data.",
  "flows": "Input data is matched against regex patterns; no further data flow or processing beyond pattern recognition occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are present. The code consists solely of pattern definitions and class initialization without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pattern recognition classes, defines regex patterns for Ukrainian military units, and sets up a recognizer class with context keywords. There are no data transformations, network operations, or system calls. The patterns appear to be straightforward regexes for matching specific Ukrainian military unit formats. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or suspicious code segments. Overall, it functions as a pattern recognizer with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pattern recognizer designed for identifying Ukrainian military units. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely performs pattern matching within the Presidio framework.",
