{
  "purpose": "To recognize Ukrainian military unit identifiers in text using regex patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input text that is analyzed by regex patterns to identify military units.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions, no untrusted data processing or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input text is matched against regex patterns; no data flow to external systems or outputs is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The patterns and class structure are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from PatternRecognizer, with multiple regex patterns designed to identify Ukrainian military units in text. The patterns are well-structured, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious operations. The class initialization sets up recognized patterns and context terms for entity recognition. No external network calls, file access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of text pattern recognition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate recognizer module for Ukrainian military units using regex patterns. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated parts or suspicious operations.",
