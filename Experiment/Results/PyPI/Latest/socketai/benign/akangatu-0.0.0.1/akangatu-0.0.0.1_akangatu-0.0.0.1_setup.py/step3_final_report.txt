  "purpose": "A minimal Python package setup script serving as a placeholder, with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields in setup(), no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing, network calls, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, which are unusual but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. It contains no dynamic elements, user input, environment variables, or external data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of the code, with consistent scoring: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The empty author fields are minor anomalies but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores are justified and align with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
