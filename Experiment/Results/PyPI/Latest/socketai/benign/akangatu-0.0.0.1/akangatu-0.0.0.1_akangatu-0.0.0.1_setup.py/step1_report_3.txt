  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, including package name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; otherwise standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package named 'akangatu'. It uses setuptools to specify package metadata such as name, version, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or handling of untrusted data. The empty author fields are unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code is a standard, minimal package setup script with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
