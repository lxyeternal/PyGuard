{
  "purpose": "To define the metadata and configuration for packaging a Python project named 'akangatu'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data; the code does not handle user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets static metadata without data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hidden behaviors detected. The setup configuration is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no dynamic or obfuscated elements. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the package appears to be a placeholder with minimal information. No external data sources, user input, or secret handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package setup script for a placeholder package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to serve as a basic template for a Python package.",
