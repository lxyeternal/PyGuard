{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the metadata for a Python package named 'akangatu'.",
  "sources": "The code sources include the import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the imported setup() function call, which uses static strings for package metadata; no external input or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The setup script appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and invokes it with static package metadata including name, version, author, and description. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, or code that could execute malicious actions. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of package configuration. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected. The only notable aspect is the minimal and placeholder-like package description, which suggests it may be a template or stub.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves a typical purpose and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code.",
