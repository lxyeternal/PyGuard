  "purpose": "Static analysis of Java source code to enforce naming conventions and class declaration standards.",
  "sources": "Reads input Java code as a string, processes line-by-line to match regex patterns for class, method, and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any external data handling, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input code is split into lines, each line is checked against regex patterns; violations are recorded as errors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, regex-based, with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static style checker for Java code, using regex to verify class names start with uppercase, method names follow camelCase, and variables follow camelCase. It does not perform external actions, code execution, or malicious activities. All regex patterns are standard for style enforcement. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's behavior is benign, with no external data flows or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Java style linter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
