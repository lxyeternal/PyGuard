  "conclusion": "No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risks is present in the provided reports. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments (e.g., lowering risk from 0.2 to 0.1 in report 3) could improve accuracy. The cautious approach due to incomplete code is justified, and no significant revisions are necessary."
