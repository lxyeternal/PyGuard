  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, network interactions, file reads, environment variables, code snippets (if available).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input, environment) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), indicating potential malicious activity if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, incomplete snippets, lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, limiting definitive conclusions. Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious indicators. Obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the absence of obfuscation evidence. Risk scores are generally set at 0.2, reflecting low but acknowledged uncertainty; however, given the lack of code and suspicious activity, lowering the risk to 0.1 in some cases (notably report 3) is justified. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on the amount of information, with higher confidence when reasoning is more thorough. Overall, the assessments are consistent, cautious, and justified by the limited data.",
  "conclusion": "No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risks is present in the provided reports. The current scores are appropriate; minor adjustments (e.g., lowering risk from 0.2 to 0.1 in report 3) could improve accuracy. The cautious approach due to incomplete code is justified, and no significant revisions are necessary.",
