{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encoding and decoding functions for transforming strings into a set of emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided to the encrypt() method via the 'string' parameter, and to the decrypt() method via the 'encrypted_token' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The methods do not write to files, send data over the network, or interact with external systems. They perform string replacements only within the code's scope.",
  "flows": "Input string to replace characters with emojis (encrypt), then replace emojis back to characters (decrypt). The flow is straightforward and limited to substitution within the string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character replacement for obfuscation but only performs substitution without any code execution or system calls. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no environment variable use, and no external dependencies involved.",
  "analysis": "The class performs simple character substitution for obfuscation purposes. The implementation is symmetrical and consistent between encrypt() and decrypt() functions. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The substitution appears to be purely cosmetic or for obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation beyond character replacement. No suspicious patterns, no code injection, and no external data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character-to-emoji substitution tool intended for simple encoding/decoding. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs only superficial transformations without system interaction or data leakage.",
