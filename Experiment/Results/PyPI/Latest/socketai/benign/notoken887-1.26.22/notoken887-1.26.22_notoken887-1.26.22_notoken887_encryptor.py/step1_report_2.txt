{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher encryption and decryption for strings, replacing characters with emoji symbols.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() or encrypted tokens provided to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent externally, stored insecurely, or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into encrypt(), where characters are replaced; output flows out as an encrypted string. Similarly, encrypted tokens flow into decrypt() and are mapped back to original characters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a substitution cipher is trivial and provides no cryptographic security; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no code injection or dynamic execution; the code is purely string replacement. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods for character substitution-based encoding and decoding using emoji replacements. There are no external inputs, network operations, file operations, or system calls. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns. It appears to be a simple obfuscation or encoding mechanism rather than a security feature. The substitution cipher is weak and does not provide security, but it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a character substitution cipher using emojis for obfuscation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears intended for simple string obfuscation rather than security or malicious purposes.",
