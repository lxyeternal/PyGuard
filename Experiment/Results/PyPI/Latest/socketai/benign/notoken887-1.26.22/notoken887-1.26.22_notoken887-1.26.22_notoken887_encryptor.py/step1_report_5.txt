{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding text by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and decryption via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the transformed strings after substitution. No external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed into 'encrypt' or 'decrypt', which perform character replacements; the transformed string is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive replace calls for character substitution but does not exhibit obfuscation, hidden code, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or backdoors are evident. Replacements are static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a symmetric substitution cipher that replaces specific characters with emojis during encryption and reverses this during decryption. The substitution is static, hardcoded, and straightforward. No external inputs, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The code does not perform any data leakage, credential theft, or malicious actions. It appears as a benign encoding/decoding utility, albeit not secure for cryptographic purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic substitution cipher for character encoding with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe but not suitable for secure encryption purposes.",
