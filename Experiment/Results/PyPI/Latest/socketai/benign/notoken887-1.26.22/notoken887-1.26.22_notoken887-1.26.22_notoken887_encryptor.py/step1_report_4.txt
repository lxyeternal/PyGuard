{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption of strings, replacing characters with emoji or symbol mappings and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the methods return processed strings but do not write to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with emojis (encrypt) → output encrypted string; Encrypted string → replace emojis with characters (decrypt) → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacement for encryption and decryption using static mappings; no external data, network, or system interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher using a large static mapping of characters to emojis and symbols. The replace() methods are chained for character-by-character transformation. No external inputs, environment variables, or system calls are used. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or malware. The functionality appears purely for obfuscation or simple encoding, not for security or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or system modification. It appears to be a harmless encoding utility.",
