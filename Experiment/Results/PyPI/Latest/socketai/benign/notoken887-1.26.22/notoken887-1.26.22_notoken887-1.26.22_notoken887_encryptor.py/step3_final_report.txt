{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple substitution cipher, replacing characters with emojis for encoding and decoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and decrypt() functions.",
  "sinks": "Replacements occur within the string; no external data sinks or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → substitution replacements → output string; similarly for decryption.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive emoji replacements as superficial obfuscation; no malicious patterns or obfuscation beyond character substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static character-to-emoji substitution for encoding and decoding. No external system interactions, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The mappings are hardcoded and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The substitution cipher is trivial and insecure cryptographically but not malicious. The code's structure is simple, with no obfuscation beyond superficial emoji replacements. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased due to superficial emoji substitution but remains low. Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher primarily used for playful encoding or superficial obfuscation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its simple, non-malicious nature.",
