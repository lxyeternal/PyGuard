{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple substitution cipher methods to encrypt and decrypt text by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings to perform character replacements for encryption and decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data leaks, network communications, or interaction with external systems; it solely processes input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed through a series of replace calls mapping characters to emojis (encrypt) or emojis to characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character substitution without any obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected. The replacement mappings are static and extensive but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic substitution cipher encoding and decoding using hardcoded mappings between characters and emojis. No external input/output, no code injection, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The substitution is transparent and reversible, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The functions are simple and stateless, purely performing character replacements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic encoding/decoding utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be for obfuscation or playful encoding purposes, not designed for malicious activity. No malware or suspicious anomalies identified.",
