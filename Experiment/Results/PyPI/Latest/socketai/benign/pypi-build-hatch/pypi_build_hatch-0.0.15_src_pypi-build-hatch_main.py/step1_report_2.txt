  "purpose": "Simple demonstration module providing basic arithmetic functions for adding one and two to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'number' in functions add_one and add_two.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the processed number; no external sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows into functions and is processed to produce output; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions that add 1 or 2 to an input number. No input validation, external data sources, or side effects are present. The code lacks any suspicious logic, external calls, or data leakage points. It is a simple, self-contained demonstration of basic arithmetic functions with clear documentation and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely educational, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a basic example for arithmetic operations without any suspicious elements.",
