  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions demonstrating addition.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in functions add_one and add_two.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the computed value; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' -> addition operation -> return output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code; functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions performing addition, with clear and direct logic. No external dependencies, network calls, or data leaks are present. The functions do not process untrusted data beyond the input parameter, and there are no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The code is purely demonstrative, benign, and easy to analyze. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
