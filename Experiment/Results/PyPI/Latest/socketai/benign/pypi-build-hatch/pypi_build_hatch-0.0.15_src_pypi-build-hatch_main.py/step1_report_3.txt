  "purpose": "Simple utility functions to add one and two to a given number, for demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data: function arguments 'number' in add_one and add_two functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements, outputting the computed number; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to addition operations, then to return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions that perform addition operations on input numbers. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no interactions with files, networks, or environment variables. The functions are basic arithmetic and do not include any hidden or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple, benign demonstration module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs basic addition operations as intended for demonstration purposes.",
