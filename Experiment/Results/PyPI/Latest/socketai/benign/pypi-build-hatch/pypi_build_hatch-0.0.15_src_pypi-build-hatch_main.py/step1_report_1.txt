  "purpose": "Utility functions to add one or two to a given number, for demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements, but no external output or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into arithmetic operations, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No external network calls or data handling beyond simple arithmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions that add 1 or 2 to an input number. The functions perform simple arithmetic and return the result. There are no data input/output beyond the function parameters and return statements. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external dependencies or network activity. The code appears to be purely demonstrative or instructional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and serves as an example for basic arithmetic functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
