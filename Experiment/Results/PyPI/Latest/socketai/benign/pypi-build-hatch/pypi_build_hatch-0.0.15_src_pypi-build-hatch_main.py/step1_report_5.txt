  "purpose": "The code provides simple mathematical functions to add one or two to a given number, serving as demonstration or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in functions add_one and add_two",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the computed result, which are not sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is processed directly and returned without modification or external interaction; flow is straightforward addition operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions that add fixed values to input parameters. No external data sources, environment variables, or untrusted data flows are present. The functions perform basic arithmetic without side effects, external calls, or suspicious operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a benign demonstration of simple functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, simple utility functions for addition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be safe and straightforward.",
