{
  "purpose": "Simple demonstration module with basic arithmetic functions for adding one or two to a number.",
  "sources": "No input sources that read external data; functions take 'number' as an argument, which is assumed to be provided externally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output that could leak data or perform unintended actions; functions simply return modified values.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to return statements after simple addition; no complex data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions that perform basic arithmetic operations, with clear and documented purposes. No external data sources, no data leaks, no system commands, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears purely educational or demonstrational, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for demonstration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
