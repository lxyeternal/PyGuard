{
  "purpose": "Simple entry point for a CLI program that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The `__main__` guard triggers when the script is executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The `print()` function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a typical `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block that executes a print statement. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or any other actions that could be malicious. The code is very simple and appears to be a standard boilerplate for a command-line interface entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious behavior, and serves a basic purpose of printing a greeting message when executed. It does not involve any security risks or suspicious activities.",
