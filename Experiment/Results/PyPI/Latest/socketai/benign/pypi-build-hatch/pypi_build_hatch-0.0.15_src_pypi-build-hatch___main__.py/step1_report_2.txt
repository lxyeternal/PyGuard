{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface, executing a simple print statement when run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `__name__` variable to determine if it is executed as the main module.",
  "sinks": "The `print()` function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data or external systems involved.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the check `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to executing `print()`, which outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple Python module that prints 'Hello, World!' when executed directly. It contains the standard `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard, which is common for CLI entry points. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data sinks beyond standard output, and no data flows involving external input. The code structure is simple and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. It performs a benign print operation with no external dependencies or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a minimal template for CLI programs, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
