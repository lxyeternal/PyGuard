  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point script that prints 'Hello, World!'",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static print statement",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network calls, or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python script with a standard '__main__' guard that outputs a static message. It contains no external data sources, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
