  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string is set. No suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '__version__ = \"v0.0.15\"' which is a standard practice in Python packages for version control. No external input, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
