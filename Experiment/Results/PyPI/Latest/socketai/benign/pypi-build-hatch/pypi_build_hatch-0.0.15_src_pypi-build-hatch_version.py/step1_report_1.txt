  "flows": "Assignment statement, no flow of data from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable. There are no external data inputs, no function calls, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. It is typical for Python packages to specify their version this way. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
