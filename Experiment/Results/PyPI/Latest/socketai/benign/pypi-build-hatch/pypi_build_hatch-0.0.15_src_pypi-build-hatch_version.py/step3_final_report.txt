  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string 'v0.0.15' to __version__, with no external inputs, no function calls, no dynamic behavior, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
