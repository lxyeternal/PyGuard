  "anomalies": "The code only assigns a version string; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting '__version__' to 'v0.0.15'. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows, and no suspicious code patterns. This is typical version declaration code, common in Python packages, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard version string assignment without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
