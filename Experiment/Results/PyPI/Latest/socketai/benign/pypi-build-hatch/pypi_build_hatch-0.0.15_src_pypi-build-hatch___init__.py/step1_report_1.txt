  "purpose": "Defines the public API for the module by importing specific functions from the main module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main' to access 'add_one' and 'add_two'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, 'add_one' and 'add_two', from a local module '.main' and exposes them via __all__ for public use. There are no data inputs, no data leaks, no network activities, and no suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a standard module initialization task without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
