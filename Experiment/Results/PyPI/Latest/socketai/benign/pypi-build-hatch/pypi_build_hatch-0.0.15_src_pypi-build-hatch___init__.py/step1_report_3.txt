{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, 'add_one' and 'add_two', from the main module, likely for use as utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports 'add_one' and 'add_two' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static imports and exports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from a local module and declares them as part of the module's public API via __all__. There are no suspicious patterns, no use of dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network interactions. The structure indicates a standard module export pattern, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal module that re-exports functions for external use. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
