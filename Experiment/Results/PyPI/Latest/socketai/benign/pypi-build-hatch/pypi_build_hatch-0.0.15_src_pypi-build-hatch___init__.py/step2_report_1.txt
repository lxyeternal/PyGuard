  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export pattern, with no data flows, no untrusted input handling, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- The code in question is minimal: importing two functions from a local module and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- The reports consistently conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is very simple: `from .main import (add_one, add_two)` and `__all__ = ['add_one', 'add_two']`.\n- There are no anomalies, no suspicious constructs, no dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **No issues are present in the code itself.**\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They correctly interpret the import/export pattern as standard and non-malicious.\n- No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (or 0.0)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (or 0.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely import/export with no data processing, no external network activity, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is minimal; no vulnerabilities are introduced by such a simple module.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- No claims of malicious intent are supported or implied.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any threat or malicious intent in this code snippet.",
