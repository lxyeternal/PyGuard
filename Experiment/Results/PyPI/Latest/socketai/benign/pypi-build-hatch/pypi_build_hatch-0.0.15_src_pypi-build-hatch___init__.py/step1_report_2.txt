  "purpose": "This code is used to import specific functions from a local module for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import add_one, add_two",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden logic, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a relative module named 'main' and defines __all__ for export control. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. The structure is simple and typical for Python packages, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a Python package that manages function exports. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
