{
  "purpose": "Defines a public API surface by importing specific functions from a local module and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from .main to module namespace, then exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal import/export pattern, no suspicious constructs or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, add_one and add_two, from a local module .main and exposes them through __all__. It is a straightforward module interface with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
