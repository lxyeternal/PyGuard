  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their claims against the provided code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .main import (add_one, add_two)\n__all__ = ['add_one','add_two']\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines public API by importing functions.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code imports `add_one` and `add_two` from `.main` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- **Findings:** No issues; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, importing functions for package use.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Re-export functions for external use.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code imports and exposes functions with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Re-export functions from `.main`.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately describes the import and export pattern, with no anomalies.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, exporting functions.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the benign, straightforward nature.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code in all reports is identical and matches the original snippet.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None of the reports suggest any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Since the code only imports and exposes functions without any data handling, network activity, or hidden logic, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be **0**.\n\n**However,** if I were to assign an overall estimate based on the entire set:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring. The code is a standard module interface with no malicious or security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the `.main` module does not contain malicious code, but based on the provided context, the current code is safe.",
