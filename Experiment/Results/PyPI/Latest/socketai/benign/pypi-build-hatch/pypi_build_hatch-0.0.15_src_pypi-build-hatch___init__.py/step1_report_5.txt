{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that exports two functions, add_one and add_two, which are imported from a local main module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.main), exporting list __all__",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external effects are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and explicitly defines them for export via __all__. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no suspicious code constructs. The structure is simple and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to re-export functions from a local module without any malicious intent or security risks.",
