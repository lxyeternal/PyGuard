  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n```python\nfrom .main import (add_one, add_two)\n__all__ = ['add_one','add_two']\n```\nThis code imports two functions from a local module `.main` and exposes them via `__all__`. It is a minimal, straightforward module interface.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Common themes across all reports:**\n- The code is simple, importing functions from `.main`.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to define a public API surface.\n\n**Assessment of the reported scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- Confidence scores are high (1.0), indicating strong agreement on benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   - Yes. The code matches the description: simple import and export. No issues are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n   - No. The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - `securityRisk: 0` is correct.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n   - The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   - No, the code is benign, so risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, so malware score remains at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n   - No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the code:**  \n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe module interface with no security concerns.",
