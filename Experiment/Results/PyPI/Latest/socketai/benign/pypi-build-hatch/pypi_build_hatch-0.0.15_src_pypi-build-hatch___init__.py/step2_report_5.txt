  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import/export pattern.\n- The code simply imports `add_one` and `add_two` from a local module `.main` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No data flows, no untrusted inputs, no network activity, no anomalies, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Confirming the code's presence and correctness:**\n- The code is minimal but syntactically correct.\n- The import statement `from .main import (add_one, add_two)` is valid assuming a proper package structure.\n- The `__all__` declaration correctly exposes these functions for external use.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n- There are no logical flaws or security issues in the code.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score of 0 aligns with the benign, straightforward code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module interface pattern.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
