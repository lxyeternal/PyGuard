{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, add_one and add_two, from the main module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import (add_one, add_two), which reads the main module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports and exports functions, with no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply exposes imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports functions from its main submodule. It contains an import statement and an __all__ declaration, both standard practices for defining public API surfaces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal, focused solely on interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface that exposes specific functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
