  "purpose": "A set of pytest unit tests for the OutlierRemover class, verifying various outlier detection and handling methods, exception handling, and object representation.",
  "sources": "In-memory pandas DataFrame created within test fixtures and functions; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; all operations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Test functions instantiate OutlierRemover, apply fit_transform to sample data, and verify outputs; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign unit test suite for a data preprocessing class. It uses standard libraries and testing practices, with no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. All tests focus on internal data transformations and exception handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is solely to verify functionality, with no security risks or obfuscation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal security risk score assigned in one report (0.1) is an overestimation; the overall risk is effectively zero.",
