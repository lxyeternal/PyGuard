{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for the OutlierRemover class, which performs various outlier detection and correction methods on pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Code reads test data provided by the sample_data fixture; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sample_data fixture through OutlierRemover methods for processing and transformations within the test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. Usage of standard libraries and a custom class without suspicious code appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports testing libraries (pytest, pandas, numpy) and a custom module (OutText_preprocessing.outlier_removal). It defines multiple test functions verifying different methods of OutlierRemover, including typical and edge cases, such as invalid method handling. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for unit testing and does not perform any external network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for a data preprocessing class focused on outlier handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard testing script for data cleaning functions.",
