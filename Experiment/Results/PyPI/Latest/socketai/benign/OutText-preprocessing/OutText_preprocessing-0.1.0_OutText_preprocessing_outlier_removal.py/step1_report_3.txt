{
  "purpose": "A utility class for detecting and reducing outliers in datasets using various statistical and transformation methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, and sklearn.preprocessing; no external data input sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Data processing methods that modify data in place or return processed data; no external data sinks or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via fit_transform or multi_outlier_multi_columns methods, processed internally through various outlier detection/capping techniques, and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Methods are standard for outlier handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of various outlier detection and mitigation techniques using standard statistical and machine learning libraries. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious system interactions are present. The methods perform typical data transformations such as Z-score filtering, capping, Yeo-Johnson transformations, impact reduction, adaptive trimming, and local standardization. No obfuscated code features or hidden behaviors are detected. The code appears to serve as a utility for data preprocessing, with no malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data preprocessing utility for outlier handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It relies solely on standard libraries for statistical and data transformation tasks.",
