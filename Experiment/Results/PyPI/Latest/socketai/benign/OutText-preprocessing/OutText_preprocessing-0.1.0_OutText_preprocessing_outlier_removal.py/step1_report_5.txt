{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility class for various outlier removal and impact reduction methods on pandas DataFrames or Series, supporting multiple techniques such as z-score, Yeo-Johnson transformation, and adaptive trimming.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through method parameters 'data' in various functions like fit_transform, multi_outlier_multi_columns, and private methods that operate on pandas DataFrames, typically extracting numeric columns for processing.",
  "sinks": "The code performs in-place modifications of data DataFrames, returning the processed versions. No direct data leaks or external network operations are present. There are no suspicious data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (data), through various transformation functions, with source-to-sink paths mainly within data manipulation routines. No untrusted external sources or sinks such as network sockets or file I/O are explicitly used.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are present. The methods use standard data processing libraries and techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of data processing methods designed for outlier detection and mitigation in pandas DataFrames. It employs common statistical and transformation techniques, all using publicly documented libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy, and scikit-learn. No malicious code or sabotage mechanisms are evident. The logic is focused on data transformation, with no external system calls, network communication, or data exfiltration routines. The absence of hidden or suspicious code patterns suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing utility for outlier mitigation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It strictly performs in-memory data transformations using reputable libraries. No malware indicators or security risks are identified based on this review.",
