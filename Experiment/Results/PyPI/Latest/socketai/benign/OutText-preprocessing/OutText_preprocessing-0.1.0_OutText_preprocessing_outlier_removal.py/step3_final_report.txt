  "purpose": "A data preprocessing utility for outlier detection and mitigation using statistical methods.",
  "sources": "Data is read from pandas DataFrame or Series objects; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is returned as pandas DataFrames; no external data sinks or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into outlier detection methods (e.g., z-score, Yeo-Johnson), which modify or filter the data, returning cleaned DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no obfuscation, external calls, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard statistical transformations and outlier handling techniques using well-known libraries. It does not perform network, file, or system operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The methods are transparent, and the code structure is clear. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data preprocessing utility with no malicious or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
