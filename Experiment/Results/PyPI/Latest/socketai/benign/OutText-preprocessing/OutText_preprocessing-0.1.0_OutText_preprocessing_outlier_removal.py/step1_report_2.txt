{
  "purpose": "A utility class for flexible outlier removal and impact reduction in datasets, supporting multiple methods including z-score, Yeo-Johnson transformation, impact capping, adaptive trimming, and local standardization.",
  "sources": "Data inputs via the 'fit_transform' method, 'multi_outlier_multi_columns' method, and data passed into various internal processing methods. Data is read from pandas DataFrame objects.",
  "sinks": "Processed data returned as pandas DataFrames; no explicit data leakage or untrusted output. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from pandas DataFrame columns; transformation functions process numeric data; thresholds and statistical computations are used to modify data; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code uses standard statistical transformations, DataFrame manipulations, and well-known data processing techniques. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for outlier management with multiple methods, all of which are typical statistical and data transformation techniques. Functions operate on numeric pandas DataFrame columns, applying z-score calculations, transformations, capping, and smoothing. The methods are standard and do not perform any network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration. There is no evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent. The design is transparent and focused solely on data processing for outlier handling. No external dependencies or functions invoke suspicious or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data preprocessing techniques for outlier management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. The overall security risk is negligible. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
