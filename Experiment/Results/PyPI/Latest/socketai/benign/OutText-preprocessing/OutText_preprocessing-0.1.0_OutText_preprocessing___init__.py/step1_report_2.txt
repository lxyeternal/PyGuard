  "purpose": "Defines module exports for outlier removal and text preprocessing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.outlier_removal and .text_preprocessing).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive information processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, establishing module interface exports. There are no operations, data handling, or external interactions that could introduce security risks or malicious intent. The structure is typical for Python packages defining public API surfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export declaration with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and straightforward.",
