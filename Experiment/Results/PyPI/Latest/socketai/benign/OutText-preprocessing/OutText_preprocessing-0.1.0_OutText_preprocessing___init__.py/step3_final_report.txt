  "purpose": "Module re-export of classes OutlierRemover and TextPreprocessor for external use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .outlier_removal and .text_preprocessing",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow beyond module initialization",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export statements with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py pattern, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and typical for module initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
