{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module that re-exports classes 'OutlierRemover' and 'TextPreprocessor' from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules '.outlier_removal' and '.text_preprocessing'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; simple module re-export",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module re-exporting without data processing, user input, or external network activity. It imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, typical for Python package organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module re-export with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
