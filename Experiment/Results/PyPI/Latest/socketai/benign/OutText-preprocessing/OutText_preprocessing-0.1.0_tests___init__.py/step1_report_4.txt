  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables or possibly external sources such as environment variables or function parameters. Exact sources are not specified due to lack of visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, or file writes if present, but the specific sink points are not identified without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or external data) to sinks (outputs, network, files) via intermediate processing, but detailed flow paths are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident in the provided code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The absence of visible external data sources, suspicious behaviors, or malicious operations suggests a benign purpose. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected. Since the code fragment is minimal or unspecified, confidence in this assessment is limited, but based on available data, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a benign function, with no anomalies or suspicious activities detected. Due to the limited code context, the confidence score is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
