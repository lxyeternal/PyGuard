The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, considering the use of external libraries and potential minor misuse, but overall the code poses minimal threat."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0 (or 0.1 considering the path issue). The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with this analysis."

      "conclusion": "Report 2 presents high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and security risk of 0.65. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately set to low levels. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, and no significant revisions are needed."
