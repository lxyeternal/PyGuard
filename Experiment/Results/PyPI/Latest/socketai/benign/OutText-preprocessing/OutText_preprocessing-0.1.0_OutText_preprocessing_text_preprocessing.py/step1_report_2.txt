{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for preprocessing and cleaning text data for NLP tasks, including functions for handling contractions, emojis, special characters, multi-language stopword removal, and more.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as stopword lists, contraction dictionaries, and input text from parameters or DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that send untrusted data over the network, write to files, or access sensitive system resources.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through various cleaning functions, with no external data flows or untrusted data sources beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External library usage (nltk, emoji, autocorrect, pandas) is standard for text processing.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard text preprocessing tasks such as removing numbers, punctuation, stopwords, emojis, and expanding contractions, with support for multiple languages. It uses external libraries in a typical manner, with no indication of malicious intent. No network operations, hidden backdoors, or code injection features are present. All functionalities are typical for NLP preprocessing modules. The only potential concern is the use of the 'autocorrect' library, but it is a legitimate library for spell correction and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical NLP preprocessing class with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses common libraries for text cleaning, with no evidence of harmful functionalities or malware. The code appears safe and benign.",
