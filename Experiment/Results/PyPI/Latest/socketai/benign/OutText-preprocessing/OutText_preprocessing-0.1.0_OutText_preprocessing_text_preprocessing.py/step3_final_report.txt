{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive NLP text preprocessing utility supporting multiple languages, performing cleaning, contraction expansion, emoji removal, URL removal, small word removal, repeated character reduction, number-to-word normalization, and spell correction.",
  "sources": "Input text data provided to methods such as clean_text, advanced_clean, or applied via DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "Processed text returned or stored; no external data flows, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input text → cleaning functions (e.g., remove numbers, punctuation, emojis, URLs) → contraction expansion, spell correction, normalization → output text.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors; static contraction dictionaries contain redundancies but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard NLP libraries and techniques for text cleaning. It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or system modifications. The use of libraries like nltk, emoji, autocorrect, and pandas is legitimate. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The contraction dictionaries are static and straightforward. The spell correction and emoji removal are benign features. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or complex dynamic code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign NLP preprocessing utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, considering the use of external libraries and potential minor misuse, but overall the code poses minimal threat.",
