{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for text preprocessing and cleaning, supporting multiple languages and various text normalization methods.",
  "sources": "Inputs include text data from method parameters, potentially from DataFrame columns when using apply_to_dataframe.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no code writes data to external systems, network, or file, or performs actions like executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows through cleaning, normalization, and contraction expansion methods. No suspicious data flow paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are detected. The code performs straightforward text processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of text preprocessing routines, including removal of numbers, punctuation, stopwords, emojis, and URL cleaning. It also supports multiple languages for stopwords and contraction expansion. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is observed. The use of common libraries (nltk, emoji, autocorrect, pandas) aligns with legitimate NLP preprocessing tasks. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, network communication, or other malware behaviors. The code adheres to typical design patterns for text cleaning and normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate text preprocessing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network actions. Overall security risk is very low.",
