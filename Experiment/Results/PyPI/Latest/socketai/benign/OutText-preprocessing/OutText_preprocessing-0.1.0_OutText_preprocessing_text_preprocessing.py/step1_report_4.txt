{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive text preprocessing class for NLP tasks, including cleaning, contraction expansion, emoji removal, spell correction, and multi-language stopword filtering.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters (e.g., text inputs, DataFrame columns), the stopword lists from nltk, and internal dictionaries for contractions. It also downloads stopwords data from nltk during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the spell correction method using 'autocorrect', which could process untrusted input, and the application of various regex-based cleaning functions. No direct data leakage or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Text data flows from input parameters into cleaning and normalization methods, where it may be transformed, spell-checked, or cleaned further. Data then can be stored back into DataFrame columns or returned as processed text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are present. The contraction dictionaries are large but static, and the code operates purely on text processing functions without obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical NLP preprocessing class that leverages standard libraries like re, string, nltk, emoji, and autocorrect. It performs text cleaning, contraction expansion, emoji removal, URL removal, spell correction, and multi-language stopword filtering. All operations are standard, with no indications of malicious intent. No external network calls or file writes are present. The download of 'stopwords' occurs during initialization, which is typical for NLP tasks. The dictionaries for contractions are static and do not involve dynamic code execution or external data fetching. The functions handle text transformations securely, with no evident data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured NLP preprocessing class with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard text cleaning tasks suitable for NLP workflows. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are identified.",
