  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign NLP preprocessing utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, considering the use of external libraries and potential minor misuse, but overall the code poses minimal threat."
