{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project called 'OutText_preprocessing', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.md', importing 'setuptools' functions, and specifying dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script is for package setup; no runtime data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to follow standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata, dependency lists, and configuration. It reads a README file for description, specifies dependencies like pandas and numpy, and sets testing configurations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for Python package setup files and does not include any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
