{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'OutText_preprocessing', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static package configuration data",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "N/A; configuration code with static data, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup.py pattern, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package dependencies, and includes metadata such as author info and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no input validation, and no data leaks are present. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The dependencies are common scientific libraries, and the script simply prepares package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices without suspicious or malicious content.",
