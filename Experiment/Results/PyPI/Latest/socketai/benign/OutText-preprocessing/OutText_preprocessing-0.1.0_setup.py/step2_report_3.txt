  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py configuration.\n- No untrusted input processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The use of open('README.md') is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- Dependencies are common scientific libraries.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 across all instances.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is consistently 0.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor concern could be the use of open() without context validation, but this is standard practice in setup scripts.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; no security risks are apparent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe setup.py script with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** Given the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
