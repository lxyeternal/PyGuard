{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute a Python library named 'OutText_preprocessing' that provides outlier removal and text preprocessing functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from 'README.md' for long_description, and it automatically discovers package modules with find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; the script mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a package setup script and does not process runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code adheres to standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, reads a README file for the description, specifies dependencies, and configures testing tools. All components are standard for Python package distribution. No input or output operations are performed at runtime beyond reading a file, and there are no dynamic code executions or external connections.\n\nThe code appears to be a typical setup.py file used for packaging Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to package and distribute the specified library.",
