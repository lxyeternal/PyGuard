  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python project 'OutText_preprocessing'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md'; gathers package information using find_packages(). No untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this script.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with typical dependencies. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup configuration using setuptools. It imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, dependencies, and test configurations. There are no dynamic code executions, external data processing, or potential attack vectors. The dependencies listed are common scientific and testing libraries. The file reads a README file for long description, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard packaging configuration for a Python project.",
