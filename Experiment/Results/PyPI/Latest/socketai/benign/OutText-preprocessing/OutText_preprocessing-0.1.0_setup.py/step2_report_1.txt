  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project.\n- The code reads 'README.md' via open() without validation—standard practice, not suspicious.\n- No dynamic code execution, untrusted input processing, or external connections are present.\n- Dependencies are common scientific libraries, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The confidence level is high (1) in all cases, indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious code features are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of 'tests_require' is deprecated in favor of 'tests_require' or 'extras_require', but this is a minor issue unrelated to security.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the use of 'open()' without a context manager, which could lead to resource leaks if the file isn't properly closed. However, this is a common pattern in setup.py scripts and does not impact security.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Risk: Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThis setup.py script is a typical, benign package configuration with no security concerns.",
