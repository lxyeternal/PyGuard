  "purpose": "Unit tests for the TextPreprocessor class in the OutText_preprocessing module to verify text preprocessing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports of pytest, sys, os, and the TextPreprocessor class; data inputs such as sample_text, text strings in tests.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code does not write or transmit data, or execute external commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input strings (sample_text, texts in tests) are passed to the transform method of TextPreprocessor instances. No untrusted sources interact with sinks that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unit tests to validate text preprocessing functions: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization, handling multiple texts, empty strings, and invalid input types. It imports testing frameworks and the main class under test, then creates test cases to ensure expected behavior. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden code, or external communications. All inputs are controlled within the test environment, and there are no signs of obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a text preprocessing class with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily performs validation of functionality without external dependencies or data leaks.",
