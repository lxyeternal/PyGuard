  "purpose": "Unit tests for the TextPreprocessor class to verify text preprocessing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.path modification, pytest fixtures, and test functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, code injection, or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data from test cases flows through the transform method of TextPreprocessor; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.append with os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname('__file__')) is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a text preprocessing class using pytest. It imports necessary modules, appends a path, and runs multiple tests on the TextPreprocessor class to verify its functions. No external data sources, network activities, or file manipulations are present. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no interactions with sensitive data. The sys.path modification is non-standard but benign in this context. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward test suite with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test suite with no malicious or security-compromising behavior detected. No evidence of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe.",
