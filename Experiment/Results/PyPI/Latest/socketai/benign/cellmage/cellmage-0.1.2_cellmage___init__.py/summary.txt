  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting filesystem and import operations common in plugin systems but not inherently dangerous."
