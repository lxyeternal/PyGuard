  "purpose": "Provides model name mappings between aliases and full model names, loading from YAML files and managing multiple mappings.",
  "sources": "YAML files loaded via load_mappings(), directory traversal in find_mapping_file()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; YAML files are read and stored in memory",
  "flows": "YAML file content loaded into _mappings dictionary; directory search for configuration files",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard practices and no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads YAML files using yaml.safe_load(), manages mappings with add/remove/get methods, and searches parent directories for configuration files. It performs file I/O and directory traversal without executing code or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The YAML parsing mitigates code injection risks, and the directory search pattern is standard. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, configuration management purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility for managing model name mappings. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to loading untrusted YAML files, which is mitigated by safe parsing. The scores in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
