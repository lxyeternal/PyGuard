  "purpose": "Manage and load model name mappings from YAML files, supporting alias-to-full name conversions and file discovery in directory structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from YAML files via yaml.safe_load() when load_mappings() is called, and from the filesystem using Path.exists() in find_mapping_file().",
  "sinks": "The data loaded from YAML is stored in internal mappings; the code does not directly feed untrusted data into vulnerable sinks. File existence checks are safe filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "YAML file content flows from load_mappings() into internal mappings; find_mapping_file() flows directory paths based on the provided or current directory.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads model mappings from YAML files, which is a controlled operation using yaml.safe_load(), a safe function for parsing YAML. It handles file discovery in a directory hierarchy. No data is executed or transmitted; the only potential concern is malformed YAML or unexpected data structure, but this is managed with validation checks. No external network calls, no code injection points, and no sensitive data handling beyond YAML parsing are present. The use of logging is standard. Overall, the code appears to perform intended configuration management without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for managing model name mappings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads YAML files and manages internal mappings with filesystem searches. No malware or security threats are evident.",
