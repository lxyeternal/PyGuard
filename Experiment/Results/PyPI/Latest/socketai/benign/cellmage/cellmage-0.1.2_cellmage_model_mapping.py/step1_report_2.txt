  "purpose": "Manage model name mappings through loading, adding, removing, and retrieving mappings, primarily from YAML configuration files.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (open, Path.exists) and YAML.safe_load for loading YAML configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of untrusted YAML files loaded from the filesystem which could contain malicious content or malformed data, but YAML.safe_load mitigates most code execution risks.",
  "flows": "File content read -> YAML.safe_load -> update internal dictionary; no external data or untrusted input flows directly to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries, with proper exception handling for file operations. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads YAML files to load mappings into an internal dictionary. The loading process uses yaml.safe_load, which prevents code execution via YAML deserialization. No external network activity, cryptic code, or hidden backdoors are present. The class offers standard file lookup in parent directories, which is a typical pattern. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks. It appears as straightforward, well-structured configuration handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for loading and managing model name mappings from YAML configuration files. It employs safe YAML parsing and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
