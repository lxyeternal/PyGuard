  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility for managing model name mappings. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to loading untrusted YAML files, which is mitigated by safe parsing. The scores in all reports are appropriate and justified."
