  "purpose": "Provides a class for loading, managing, and retrieving model name mappings from YAML files, primarily for alias-to-full-name conversions.",
  "sources": "Reading YAML files via open() and yaml.safe_load(), reading from filesystem to find mapping files.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from YAML files into internal mappings, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's use of file I/O and YAML parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads YAML files to populate a mapping dictionary, which is a common pattern. It includes standard error handling and logging. The find_mapping_file method searches parent directories for specific configuration files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. All operations are confined to file system access and data processing. Use of yaml.safe_load is appropriate for avoiding code execution risks. No unusual code, dynamic execution, or secret leaks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration management utility with standard file I/O and YAML parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely to load and manage model name mappings.",
