{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for managing model name mappings loaded from YAML files, supporting loading, adding, removing, and retrieving mappings, as well as locating mapping files in directory hierarchies.",
  "sources": "Reads from YAML files (via yaml.safe_load) in load_mappings; reads file existence via Path.exists; reads environment via Path.cwd",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network communication, no system command execution, no file writing beyond reading YAML files.",
  "flows": "Reads YAML files (source) during load_mappings; uses Path.exists to locate files; data flows from files into internal dictionary; get_full_name and add_mapping access internal mappings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors. The find_mapping_file searches parent directories, which is normal, but could be used to locate configuration files in hierarchies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for loading and managing model name mappings from YAML files. It safely loads data via yaml.safe_load, which is standard and not inherently dangerous. No user input or untrusted data is directly processed, only files specified or discovered locally. The file location function searches directories for specific filenames, a common pattern. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious system behavior is present. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malware patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward, and the library imports are standard. The use of Path for filesystem navigation is normal. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for managing model mappings, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It safely handles file operations and YAML loading without executing untrusted code or data. Overall, it is a standard, safe implementation.",
