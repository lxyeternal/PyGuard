      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting filesystem and import operations common in plugin systems but not inherently dangerous."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is designed for legitimate extension purposes, transforming cells into prompts for an LLM. However, its reliance on embedding cell content into executable code via repr() creates a potential vector for code injection if malicious input is provided. No active malware or malicious activity is detected, but the pattern warrants cautious handling. The malware score should be low, with some concern about security risk due to dynamic code execution, and a modest obfuscation score reflects the complex string generation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility for managing model name mappings. No malicious or obfuscated code is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to loading untrusted YAML files, which is mitigated by safe parsing. The scores in all reports are appropriate and justified."
