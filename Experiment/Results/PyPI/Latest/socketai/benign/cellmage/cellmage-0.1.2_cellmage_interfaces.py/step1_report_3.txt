{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract interfaces for interacting with language models, loading personas and snippets, managing conversation history, and providing UI context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input handling present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions. No network operations, file writes, or system commands are directly invoked.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines interfaces without implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code strictly declares interfaces and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple abstract classes defining interfaces for various components of a language model application. There are no executable or runtime actions, network calls, or data processing logic. No potential vectors for malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are present within these interface definitions. Since this code only sets up abstract interfaces, it cannot execute malicious activities by itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface definitions for a language model application and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural, serving as a contract for implementations. Therefore, the malware score is zero, and the security risk score is also zero.",
