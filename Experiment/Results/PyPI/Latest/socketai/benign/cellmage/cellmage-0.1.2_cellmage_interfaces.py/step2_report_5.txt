  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, content, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Confirms the code is purely abstract interface definitions with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. Since it's just interface definitions, the risk is minimal. The confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that these are abstract classes without implementation. Notes potential data flows if implementations are added but no actual malicious activity in the interface code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The interface-only nature precludes malicious behavior. The reasoning is thorough.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is purely interface definitions with no runtime or external interactions. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—interfaces only, no executable or external communication. No malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, confirms that the code is purely abstract, with no data processing or external interactions, thus no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no executable code, data flow, or external communication.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Appropriately 0; the code is purely interface definitions with no security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the content.\n- Since the code is just interface definitions, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that these are safe, standard interface definitions with no malicious potential.",
