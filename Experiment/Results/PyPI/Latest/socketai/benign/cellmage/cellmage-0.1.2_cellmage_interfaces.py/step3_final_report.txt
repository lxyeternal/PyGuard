{
  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for language model clients, persona loading, snippet provision, conversation history storage, and context provision within a modular AI system.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; code contains only class and method definitions without data input or external calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; interface methods are placeholders without implementation, thus no source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or network activity; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract class definitions with method signatures, serving as interfaces for various system components. There are no implementations, data processing, or external interactions. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity and simplicity. The security risk score is 0, given the lack of executable logic or data flow that could introduce vulnerabilities. Confidence in these assessments is high (1.0), as the code is purely declarative and standard for interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of interface definitions for a modular language model system. It contains no executable logic, malicious behavior, or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
