{
  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for components of a language model client system, including chat handling, persona loading, snippet management, conversation history storage, and UI context provision.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists entirely of class and method definitions without data input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output mechanisms are directly implemented or exposed.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code; it only specifies method signatures for subclasses to implement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard design patterns for interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed entirely of abstract class definitions serving as interfaces, outlining methods without implementation. It does not include any runtime code, data handling, or external interactions. The absence of concrete logic means there are no direct data sources or sinks, nor any executable flows that could be exploited. The structure is straightforward and adheres to typical design conventions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of interface definitions for a language model client system, with no executable logic or data handling. It appears safe, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Its primary purpose is to enforce structure in implementations, not to perform operations itself.",
