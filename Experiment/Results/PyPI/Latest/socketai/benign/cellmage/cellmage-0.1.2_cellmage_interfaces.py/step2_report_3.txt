  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is purely abstract interface definitions with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues identified.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, this code defines interfaces without implementation. It notes potential data flows if implementations are provided, but no actual data handling occurs here. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—interfaces only, no runtime logic or external interactions. No malicious behavior or security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, purely abstract class definitions with no executable code or data flows. No signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—interfaces only, no implementation, no runtime behavior, no security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is solely composed of abstract interface definitions with no executable logic, data flows, or external interactions. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriately set to zero across all reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks are evident in interface definitions alone.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe assessments are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, serving as a structural contract for implementations, with no inherent security issues.",
