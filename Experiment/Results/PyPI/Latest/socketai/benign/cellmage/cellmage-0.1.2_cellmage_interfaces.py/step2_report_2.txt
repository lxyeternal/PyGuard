  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Confirms the code is purely interface definitions with no executable logic, no external data, or malicious activity. The report assigns malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Justification:** The code is foundational and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of executable logic, secrets, or malicious code. Notes potential data flows in concrete implementations but not in the interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Additional notes:** The report correctly states that actual risks depend on implementation, which is not present here.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—no executable code, no malicious activity, purely interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Additional:** Highlights that no runtime actions or external calls are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, purely abstract classes with no implementation, no data handling, no network or file I/O.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Correct.\n- **Additional:** Emphasizes the safe, declarative nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others—interfaces only, no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Additional:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely interface definitions with no executable logic, external data handling, or malicious behavior.\n- The assigned scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward, declarative structure.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified in interface definitions.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard set of interface definitions for a modular language model application. It is safe, non-obfuscated, and free from malware or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature.",
