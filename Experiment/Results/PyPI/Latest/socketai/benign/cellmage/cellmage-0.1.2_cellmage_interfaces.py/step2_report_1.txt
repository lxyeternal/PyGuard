  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, content, and scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely abstract class definitions with no implementation or executable logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified, no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that these are interface definitions with no inherent security issues. The high confidence (1.0) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on the absence of executable code, secrets, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The report notes potential data flows in concrete implementations but clarifies that the interface code itself is benign. The confidence (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, purely interface definitions with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly emphasizes that no malicious activity can be inferred from these abstract classes. Confidence (1.0) is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern — interface definitions with no executable code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The report accurately notes the lack of malicious patterns or embedded secrets. Confidence (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, focusing on the purely declarative nature.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly states that these are interface definitions with no security concerns. Confidence (1.0) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of abstract class definitions with no executable logic, data handling, or network interactions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, as there are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** Appropriately scored as 0 across all reports, given the lack of concrete implementation or data flow.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions for a modular language model system, with no evidence of supply chain security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code fragment appears safe, well-structured, and free of security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
