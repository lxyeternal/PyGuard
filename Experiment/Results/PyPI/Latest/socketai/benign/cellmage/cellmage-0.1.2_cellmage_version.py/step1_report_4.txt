  "purpose": "Define version information for a software package using semantic versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "String formatting operations to generate version strings.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of hardcoded version components into version strings (VERSION_SHORT and VERSION).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses straightforward string assignments and formatting without obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX) and constructs version strings using string formatting. There are no input sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The comments clarify versioning semantics but do not introduce any suspicious behavior. The code appears solely to manage version information in a conventional manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing software version strings with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
