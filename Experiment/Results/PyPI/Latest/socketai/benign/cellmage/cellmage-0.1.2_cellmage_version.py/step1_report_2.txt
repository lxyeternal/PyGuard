  "sinks": "String formatting outputs; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Version components are combined into formatted version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version numbers are typical and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version components as string constants and constructs version strings via string formatting. There are no input sources, no untrusted data, and no operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. It is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration without any malicious intent or security risks.",
