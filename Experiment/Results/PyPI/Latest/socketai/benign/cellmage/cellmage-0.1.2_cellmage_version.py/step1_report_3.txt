  "purpose": "Define versioning information for the software package using semantic versioning conventions.",
  "sources": "Constants _MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, and _SUFFIX, which are set explicitly within the code.",
  "sinks": "String formatting operations that generate VERSION_SHORT and VERSION strings.",
  "flows": "Values of _MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, and _SUFFIX are combined through format strings to produce version identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version components as string constants and constructs version strings through straightforward string formatting. It includes comments explaining semantic versioning and nightly build suffixes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The logic is simple and aligns with standard versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of version string definitions with clear comments and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
