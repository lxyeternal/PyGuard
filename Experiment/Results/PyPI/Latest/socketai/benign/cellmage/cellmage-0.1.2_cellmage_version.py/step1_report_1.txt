  "purpose": "Define versioning information for the software project using semantic versioning conventions.",
  "sources": "Constants for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX) initialized with string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Formatting of version strings using string formatting with static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward assignment and string formatting without external input or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines version number components as string literals and constructs version strings through simple string formatting. No external data sources, user input, or environmental variables are used. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscation. It adheres to standard versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version definition and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard, safe, and appears to be a typical versioning snippet.",
