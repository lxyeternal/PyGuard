  "purpose": "Define version information for the software package, including major, minor, patch, and suffix components.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "Formatting strings to create VERSION_SHORT and VERSION variables.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version components into string variables for version identification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version number components as strings, then constructs version strings using string formatting. There are no input sources, network operations, environment variable reads, or data leaks. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, external communication, or sensitive data handling. Its purpose is purely to define version information, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard versioning boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
