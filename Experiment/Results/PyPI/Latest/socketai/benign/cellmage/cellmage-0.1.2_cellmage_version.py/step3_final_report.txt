  "purpose": "Define version components and construct version strings for release management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals for major, minor, patch, and suffix version parts.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static assignment with no external input or output.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version parts to string variables, then formatting into version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-commented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as static strings and formats them into version strings. It involves no dynamic data, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is purely for version management, with comments explaining semantic versioning. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard versioning snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
