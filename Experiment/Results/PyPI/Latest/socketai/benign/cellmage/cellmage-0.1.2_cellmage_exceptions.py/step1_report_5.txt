  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a notebook-based large language model (LLM) environment.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception, no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output affecting security.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class declarations for exception handling, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, each representing specific error scenarios related to LLM operations. All classes are straightforward and do not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. There are no input sources, data sinks, or flows involving untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines custom exception classes for structured error handling. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The implementation appears safe and standard.",
