  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Notebook LLM operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures, no data input or external sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code strictly defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. It includes no data handling, network activity, or execution of untrusted code. There are no obfuscated elements or signs of malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling in Python. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling within a larger system. It does not contain any malicious code, malware, or security risks.",
