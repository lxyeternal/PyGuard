  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Notebook LLM system",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structure",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Class inheritance hierarchy; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, all inheriting from a base error class. There are no function calls, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and static, serving as a structured error handling mechanism. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward class definitions for exception handling with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
