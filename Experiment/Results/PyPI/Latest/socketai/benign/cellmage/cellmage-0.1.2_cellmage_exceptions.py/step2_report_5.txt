  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, serving as an error handling structure.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs are detected.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or handle sensitive information.\n\n3. **Error in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports' reasoning aligns with the code content; they correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - **Confidence:** All are 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n   \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They focus on the static nature of the code and its lack of external interactions.\n\n6. **Potential Risks and Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, the risk is minimal.\n   - No reason to assign higher malware or security risk scores.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious constructs)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a typical purpose in error handling. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
