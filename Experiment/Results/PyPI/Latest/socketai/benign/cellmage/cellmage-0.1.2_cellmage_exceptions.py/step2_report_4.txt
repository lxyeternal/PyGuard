  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or input/output operations.\n   - The classes are straightforward, static, and serve as error categories.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are detected.\n   - The code is benign and typical for error handling in Python applications.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - The logical consistency of the scores aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Intent:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no basis for any malware or security risk.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are warranted here.\n\n5. **Any Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, detailed, and correctly conclude that the code is safe.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no security concerns.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - No modifications or re-evaluations are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence scores are justified at **1**.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Notebook LLM system. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scoring reflects this accurately.",
