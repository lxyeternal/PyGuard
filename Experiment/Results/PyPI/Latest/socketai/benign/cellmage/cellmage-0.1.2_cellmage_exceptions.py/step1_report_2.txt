  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Notebook LLM operations.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; these are simple class declarations with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from a base exception class. All classes are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no data manipulation or storage within these snippets. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling mechanism, typical for Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious intent, no malware, and no security risks. It functions solely for error classification within a larger system.",
