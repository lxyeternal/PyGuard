  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Notebook LLM system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions; no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with no functions, data processing, or external calls. It is static and serves as a structured error handling mechanism. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
