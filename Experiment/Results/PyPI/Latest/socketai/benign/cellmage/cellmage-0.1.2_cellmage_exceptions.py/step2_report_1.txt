  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided reports and the code snippet.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, all inheriting from a base exception class.\n   - There are no function calls, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, static error handling structure.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, external interactions, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions with no external or dynamic behavior, the risk score should remain very low.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n   - Any higher score would imply potential malicious or risky behavior, which is not supported by the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - There are no assumptions about hidden behavior or external dependencies.\n   - Their reasoning is sound and based on the code's actual content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code is benign and poses no security concerns.",
