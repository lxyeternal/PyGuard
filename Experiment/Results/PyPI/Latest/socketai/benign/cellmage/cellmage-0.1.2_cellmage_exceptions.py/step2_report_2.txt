  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class. There are no function calls, data processing, or external interactions. No issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a structured error handling mechanism. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as no malicious behavior is detected.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.  \n   - **Confidence (1)**: Justified, given the straightforward nature of the code and consistent analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, static class definitions with no external interactions, there's no reason to assign a higher risk score. The code's purpose is clear, safe, and standard.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's static structure. No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. All reports correctly assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, with full confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is purely class definitions for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard, benign implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
