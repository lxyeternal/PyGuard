  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Notebook LLM application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from base Exception class.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and handling mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Error handling flow via custom exceptions, but no data flow from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Python class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are designed to categorize different error types for a specific application. There are no input data sources, no data processing, no external calls, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining exception classes, which is a common and safe practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes used for error categorization. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and appears safe.",
