  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of symbolic weight management classes. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, with the security risk score being slightly overcautious but justifiable. The supply chain security posture for this code should be considered safe."
