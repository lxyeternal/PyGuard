{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling weights associated with states and terms, supporting mathematical operations, replacements, and querying in a probabilistic or weighted logic system.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and project-specific modules; class methods accessing attributes and performing computations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted external input or send data over networks; no code that writes to files, executes system commands, or communicates externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within class methods performing internal manipulations and calculations, such as addition, multiplication, replacement, and matching of weights and terms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns beyond standard class and method definitions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structures (Weight and Weights) for managing and manipulating sets of weighted terms and states. It uses standard Python features and safe data handling. No external input sources are processed insecurely, nor are there indications of malicious data transmission or system compromise. All methods perform expected mathematical or data management operations. The import statements and class methods do not perform any network or file operations that could be malicious. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a larger system for weighted logic or probabilistic modeling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of weighted state and term management classes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. There are no external data sinks, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears safe and benign.",
