  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, domain-specific utility for managing logical issue structures. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interactions. The reliance on external methods is standard and does not imply malicious intent unless those methods are maliciously implemented elsewhere. Overall, the code appears safe with minimal security risk."
