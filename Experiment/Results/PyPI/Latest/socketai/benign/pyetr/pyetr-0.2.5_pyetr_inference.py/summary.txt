  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific reasoning framework implementing inference and decision procedures. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
