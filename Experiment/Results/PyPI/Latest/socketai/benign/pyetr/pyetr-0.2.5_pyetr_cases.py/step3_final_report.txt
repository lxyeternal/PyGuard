{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for logical reasoning, inference, and testing within a framework that models views, probabilities, and logical relations. It primarily serves as a test suite or educational example for a reasoning system.",
  "sources": "String inputs parsed into View objects via View.from_str, class attributes defining views and probabilities, internal method calls such as update, query, depose, factor, etc.",
  "sinks": "Internal method calls and data transformations; no external network, file, or system calls; no data exfiltration or external I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> View.from_str parsing -> internal method calls (update, query, depose, factor) -> logical inference outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The complex string parsing ('ps') is part of the framework's modeling, not malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of classes and functions for modeling logical and probabilistic reasoning, with inputs from string representations and class attributes. It uses standard methods for inference and testing, with no external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns. The use of string parsing ('ps') and internal method calls is consistent with a reasoning framework. No signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The data flows are contained within the system, and the code is intended for testing, demonstration, or educational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and designed for logical inference testing. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1). It is safe for use as a dependency in a supply chain.",
