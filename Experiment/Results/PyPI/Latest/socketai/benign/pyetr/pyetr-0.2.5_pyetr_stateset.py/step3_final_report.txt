{
  "purpose": "The code manages logical states, terms, and pattern matching, providing functions and classes for symbolic reasoning and set operations without external I/O or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions such as 'term', 'atom', 'search_term', and internal class attributes; no external data sources or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal data transformations within functions and class methods; no external system interactions or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through pattern matching, set operations, and substitutions within functions like _get_open_terms, get_opens, and class methods, without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected; assertions are safe and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured symbolic logic framework utilizing standard Python features such as set operations, class inheritance, and pattern matching. It does not perform any external I/O, network communication, or system modifications. The functions and classes serve to manipulate logical atoms, states, and terms for reasoning purposes. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, which is purely logical and data-manipulation oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a symbolic reasoning library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified given its internal data handling and absence of external effects. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very strong.",
