{
  "purpose": "The code models and manipulates dependencies between universal and existential arbitrary objects, providing methods for relation composition, validation, and querying.",
  "sources": "The code reads from class attributes, method arguments, imported modules, and external data passed to functions such as dependencies, sets of arbitrary objects, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include: dependency object creation, set and list operations, and callback invocations that may process or return arbitrary objects. No explicit network or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data sources such as callback outputs and external arguments flow into dependency object creation, relation modifications, and replacements via methods like match() and _replace_arbs(). These flows primarily influence internal data structures without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious logic are observed. The code performs standard dependency modeling with straightforward data handling. No obfuscated code or malicious intent is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code rigorously models dependency relations among arbitrary objects, with functions for transitive closure, conversion between dependency forms, and relation composition. It includes validation to ensure internal consistency and methods to replace objects and perform queries. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or malicious side effects. Callbacks are used for flexible object replacement or matching, which is standard and safe in this context. Overall, the code appears well-structured and legitimate, with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code module functions as a dependency modeling library, providing safe and standard operations for dependency analysis without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It neither accesses external resources nor performs harmful actions. The code is clean, straightforward, and appears safe for use.",
