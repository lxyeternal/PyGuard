  "purpose": "Define public API exports for a Python package, importing various classes and functions from submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules (.atoms, .dependency, .stateset, .tools, .view).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data input, external network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious patterns. Version string is straightforward. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of an __all__ list declaring public symbols, import statements bringing in classes and functions from internal modules, and setting a version string. There are no functions, no data processing, no input handling, and no external communications. The import statements suggest modular design, and the version string is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are visible. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script defining public API symbols. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on this code alone.",
