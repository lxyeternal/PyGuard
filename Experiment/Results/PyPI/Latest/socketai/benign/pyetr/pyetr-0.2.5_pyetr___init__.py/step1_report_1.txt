{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export a set of classes, functions, and constants related to predicates, dependencies, states, and views, likely for use in a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports various components from local modules (.atoms, .dependency, .stateset, .tools, .view). It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, system effects, or security vulnerabilities. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is observable; the code primarily establishes namespace exports and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code constructs, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded secrets. It mainly involves import/export statements and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of public API symbols (__all__), imports several classes and functions from local modules, and sets a version string. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive operations. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file or module index.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as an index or interface for a package, exposing various components. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is standard and safe.",
