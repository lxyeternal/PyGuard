{
  "purpose": "Defines the public API symbols for the package and imports internal modules to expose classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.atoms, .dependency, .stateset, .tools, .view)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling",
  "flows": "Import statements and the assignment of __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export structure with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module index file that declares __all__ for public API exposure, imports internal classes/functions, and sets a version string. It contains no dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is typical for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package interface file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and transparency.",
