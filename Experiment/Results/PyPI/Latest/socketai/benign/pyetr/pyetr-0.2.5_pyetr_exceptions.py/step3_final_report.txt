{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for undefined operations, inheriting from ValueError.",
  "sources": "The constructor accepts a message and optional args, which are passed to the superclass.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The message and args flow directly to the superclass constructor without additional processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a 'pragma: not covered' comment indicating test coverage exclusion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
