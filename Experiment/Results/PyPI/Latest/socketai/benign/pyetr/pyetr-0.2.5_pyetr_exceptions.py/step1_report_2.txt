  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for undefined operations or errors related to undefined operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines a class without any data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, defining a simple custom exception. The 'pragma: not covered' comment suggests the constructor is excluded from test coverage but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError, intended for signaling undefined operation errors. The constructor accepts a message and optional additional arguments, passing them to the superclass constructor. No external data inputs, network communication, or file operations are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The structure and content are typical for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate, benign piece of code.",
