{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for handling undefined operations that extend the built-in ValueError.",
  "sources": "The class is used as a type of exception, so it reads input when instantiated with a message argument.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if instantiated with untrusted input as a message, it could be used to display or log untrusted data, but no direct sink is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input (message) flows into the super().__init__ method, which could propagate untrusted data if the message is untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The class is a straightforward exception subclass with standard constructor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from ValueError. The constructor accepts a message and optional arguments, passing them to the base class. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard and benign, intended for use as a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It’s a standard pattern used in Python for defining custom errors.",
