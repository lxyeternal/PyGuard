  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling undefined operation errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError, named OperationUndefinedError, with a custom __init__ method that calls the superclass constructor. It follows standard Python class and exception patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. There are no input or output operations, no data flows, and no hardcoded secrets or external interactions. The code is simple and clear, intended solely for exception handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
