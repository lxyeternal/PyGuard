  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for undefined operations",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, standard Python class inheritance; no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError named OperationUndefinedError with an initializer that forwards its message and additional arguments to the superclass. There are no external inputs, data handling, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
