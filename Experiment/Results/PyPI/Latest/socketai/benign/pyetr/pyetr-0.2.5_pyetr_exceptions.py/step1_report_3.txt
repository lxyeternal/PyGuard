  "flows": "None; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definition with no suspicious elements or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'OperationUndefinedError' inheriting from ValueError, with an initializer that passes the message and additional arguments to the superclass. There are no external data inputs, no use of external libraries, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
