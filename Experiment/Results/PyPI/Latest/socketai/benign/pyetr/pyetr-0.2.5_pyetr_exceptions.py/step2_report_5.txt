  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward custom exception class inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data flows involving untrusted input are present.\n- The code is consistent across reports, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely to define a custom exception, which is a common and benign pattern.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The only possible concern could be if the exception message, when instantiated with untrusted input, could lead to issues like log injection or display of malicious data. However, this is a general concern with exception messages and not specific to this code snippet. The code itself does not process or sanitize input; that responsibility lies with the caller.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
