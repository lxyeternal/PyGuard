  "purpose": "Utility for generating and managing arbitrary object names, replacing objects within views, and generating power sets for symbolic reasoning or testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures such as existing_arb_objs, arb_objects, and view attributes; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; data remains within in-memory structures, with no external data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Generation of new ArbitraryObject instances from existing sets; replacement of objects within views; internal data manipulations without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Assertion in __init__ of ArbitraryObjectGenerator that raises an error on unknown schemes; no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for name generation and object replacement, using standard Python constructs. It does not process external untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assertion in the constructor is a safeguard, not a malicious backdoor. The logic is clear, and the code operates solely within memory, making it safe from supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It functions as a utility for symbolic object management. The assigned scores in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk approximately 0.1–0.2—are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
