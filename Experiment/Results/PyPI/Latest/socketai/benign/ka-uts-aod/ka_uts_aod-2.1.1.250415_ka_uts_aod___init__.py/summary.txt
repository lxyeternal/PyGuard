  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; however, Report 5's use of dynamic execution functions and obfuscation features suggest moderate suspicion. The overall risk is low but warrants careful manual review, especially of dynamic code features. Adjusted malware score for Report 5 to 0.6, obfuscated to 0.3, and risk to 0.4 to better reflect potential threats."
