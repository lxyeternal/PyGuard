  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, dynamic execution functions (eval(), exec()), file/network operations.",
  "sinks": "System commands, file writes, network transmissions, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input, files) potentially passing through dynamic execution or data handling functions to system or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), complex control flows, obfuscation indicators, missing or empty code, hardcoded secrets, unusual control structures.",
  "analysis": "The code set shows mostly benign patterns with standard data processing and no suspicious activity, consistent with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 indicates dynamic code execution and obfuscation, raising suspicion. The scores across reports align with their descriptions. The most concerning is Report 5, where eval()/exec() and obfuscation suggest potential malicious intent, warranting higher risk and malware scores. Overall, the assessments are consistent, with the need for cautious review of Report 5's actual code to confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; however, Report 5's use of dynamic execution functions and obfuscation features suggest moderate suspicion. The overall risk is low but warrants careful manual review, especially of dynamic code features. Adjusted malware score for Report 5 to 0.6, obfuscated to 0.3, and risk to 0.4 to better reflect potential threats.",
