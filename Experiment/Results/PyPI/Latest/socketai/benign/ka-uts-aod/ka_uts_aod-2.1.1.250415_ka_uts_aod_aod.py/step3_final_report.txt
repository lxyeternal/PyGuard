  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing arrays of dictionaries, data transformation, merging, and exporting to CSV in various formats.",
  "sources": "Reading data from in-memory data structures (lists and dicts), controlled dynamic function selection via sh_fnc_2_csv, file writing operations.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to CSV files, potential data leakage if file paths contain sensitive info, but no malicious data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data is read from in-memory structures, processed through various transformation functions, and written to files via controlled export functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Function selection is controlled through DoC.sh, reducing risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility module for data handling, merging, and exporting. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with controlled dynamic function selection. No external network calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. The low security risk is justified by the controlled environment and absence of external inputs or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured data utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores across all reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
