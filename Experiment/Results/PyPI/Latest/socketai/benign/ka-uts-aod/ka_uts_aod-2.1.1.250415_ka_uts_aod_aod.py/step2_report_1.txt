  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes the code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, emphasizing controlled function selection and safe practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The dynamic function selection via `sh_fnc_2_csv` is controlled through `DoC.sh`, which appears to be a configuration or documentation class, reducing risk.\n- The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the code's utility nature.\n- Malware score=0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, highlighting standard data processing functions with no external data sources or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The functions operate on in-memory data and write to files; no network or external calls.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard patterns.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) perhaps due to file writing, but this is typical for data utilities.\n- Malware remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing benign data manipulation and export functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code, external data, or malicious behavior.\n- Use of standard libraries and patterns.\n- The controlled function selection reduces risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data transformation and CSV export, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- File output functions are typical; no malicious activity detected.\n- No obfuscation or external communication.\n- The risk score is appropriate for data export utilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard data handling with no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No network, external inputs, or suspicious code.\n- The functions are standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are low and justified given the code's utility nature and controlled function selection.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to file I/O, but overall low.\n\n**Additional notes:** The dynamic function selection via `sh_fnc_2_csv` could be a minor concern if the source `DoC.sh` is compromised, but the report indicates it's controlled and unlikely to be malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
