  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing arrays of dictionaries, including data transformation, merging, exporting to CSV, and conversion to different formats.",
  "sources": "Reading data from input parameters such as lists, dictionaries, and file paths; accessing dictionary keys and values.",
  "sinks": "Writing CSV files to specified file paths; converting dataframes and writing to files.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input variables, processed through various functions, and written to files or returned as transformed data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code. The only potential concern is dynamic function selection for CSV export, but it is straightforward and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class AoD with static and class methods for manipulating arrays of dictionaries, including addition, merging, filtering, and exporting. It employs safe operations, uses standard libraries for CSV and dataframes, and logs errors when exceptions occur. The function sh_fnc_2_csv dynamically retrieves a function based on a string key, which is from a controlled source (DoC.sh), likely a configuration or documentation class, reducing risk. The overall structure is standard for data processing utilities, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for data manipulation and export, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, uses safe programming practices, and relies on controlled function retrieval for CSV output. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
