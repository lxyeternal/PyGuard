  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing and transforming arrays of dictionaries, including exporting data to CSV using different libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, pandas, polars, and custom modules; static and class methods accessing data structures and performing file I/O.",
  "sinks": "File writing methods (to_csv_with_pd, to_csv_with_pl, to_csv_with_dictwriterows), which write data to files; potential data leak if sensitive data is included in output files.",
  "flows": "Data is transformed and written from in-memory data structures (arrays of dictionaries) to CSV files via multiple export functions, with optional data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code employs standard data manipulation and export techniques. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for managing arrays of dictionaries (AoD), including merging, filtering, transforming, and exporting data. It uses standard libraries and patterns without obfuscation. File output functions are common in data processing tasks and do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling present. The presence of custom logging and document modules does not raise suspicion. Overall, the code appears to be a typical utility module for data handling with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for data transformation and export, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs safe operations and uses common patterns without hidden or malicious actions.",
