  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility classes/functions for managing arrays of dictionaries, exporting data, and merging datasets. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Dynamic function selection via `sh_fnc_2_csv` is controlled through `DoC.sh`, which is presumably a safe configuration or documentation class.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1  \n  *These are reasonable given the benign description.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies no security issues. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data transformation, merging, and CSV export. No external data sources or untrusted inputs, no network or system commands, no malicious patterns. The code is standard for data utilities.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  *Again, appropriate given the benign nature.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious signals; the risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data management, merging, exporting, and conversion. No external or untrusted input processing, no network/system calls, no obfuscation. The dynamic function selection is controlled and safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1  \n  *Appropriate.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern; the utility functions are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data management and CSV export, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious code. File output functions are typical in data processing.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  *Reasonable.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—data manipulation and export utilities, standard libraries, no external inputs or network calls, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2  \n  *Appropriate.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely data handling, with no network, system, or code injection activities.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns. All reports agree on this.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the absence of external inputs, network activity, or code injection, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting the utility nature and controlled function selection.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility module for data manipulation and export, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
