  "purpose": "Define metadata for the Python package 'ka_uts_aod', including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other attributes.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables setting metadata information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A — static metadata assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of simple variable assignments defining package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string and numeric values to variables representing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright. The values are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no external data interactions. The use of Unicode characters in __cake__ is benign and stylistic. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as package metadata and contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard header for a Python package.",
