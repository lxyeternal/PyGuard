  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no significant data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode escape sequences in a variable, but nothing suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of module-level variable assignments for package metadata. No functions, external input handling, network activity, or code execution observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The Unicode characters are benign and serve as decoration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, representing standard package metadata. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present.",
