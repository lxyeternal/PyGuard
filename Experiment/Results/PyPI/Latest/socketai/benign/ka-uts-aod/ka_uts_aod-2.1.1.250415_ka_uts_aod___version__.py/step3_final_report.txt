{
  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations including title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, copyright, and decorative Unicode.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments with static literals; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode characters (__cake__) for decoration; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or code execution. Unicode characters are used decoratively and do not introduce any malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, clear, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, static package header. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
