  "sinks": "Execution of callables within options.dynamic_labels, potential data leaks if callables access sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Calling get_labels leads to invoking functions in options.dynamic_labels, which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors; dynamic_labels containing callables that could be malicious if untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the execution of arbitrary functions stored in options.dynamic_labels, which could be malicious if sourced from untrusted inputs. The exception handling is broad, potentially hiding errors but not malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2–0.3) are consistent with the code's benign nature but acknowledge the potential risk if dynamic_labels are untrusted. To mitigate this, validation or sandboxing of functions is recommended. Overall, the code is safe but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with a potential security risk stemming from executing untrusted functions in dynamic_labels. The current scores are appropriate; however, the risk could be slightly increased if dynamic_labels are sourced from untrusted inputs. Proper validation or sandboxing is advised to prevent malicious exploitation.",
