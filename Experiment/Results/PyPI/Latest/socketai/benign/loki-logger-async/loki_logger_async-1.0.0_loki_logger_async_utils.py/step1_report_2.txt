  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating timestamp, serializing data to JSON, and assembling labels from options.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'options' object attributes (dynamic_labels, app_name, labels). It also invokes callable functions in dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps in safe_json, str conversion of timestamp, and access to options attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from options object and its attributes through functions, with potential dynamic label values fetched via function calls, then serialized or returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic_labels with callable values may lead to unexpected behavior if these functions are malicious or perform unintended actions, but this is typical for dynamic label generation. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions: now_ns generates a high-precision timestamp as a string, safe_json safely serializes data to JSON, catching exceptions to prevent crashes, and get_labels constructs a labels dictionary from the options object, executing functions stored in dynamic_labels. There are no external data inputs other than the options object, and no untrusted data flows directly to dangerous sinks. The use of dynamic labels with callable values could be exploited if these functions are malicious, but this pattern alone is not inherently malicious. The code appears to be straightforward utility code with standard practices. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions as utility helpers for timestamp generation, JSON serialization, and label assembly. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contain malware, or pose security risks based on the current context. The use of dynamic labels with callable functions warrants cautious use but is not suspicious in itself.",
