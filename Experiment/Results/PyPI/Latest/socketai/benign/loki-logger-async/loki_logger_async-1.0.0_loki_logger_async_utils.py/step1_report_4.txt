  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating timestamps, serializing JSON data, and retrieving labels with dynamic label support.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (options), environment (time module)",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() for serialization",
  "flows": "Data from options and options.dynamic_labels to json.dumps() via safe_json, and from options to get_labels output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns observed. The dynamic_labels are generated via functions, but no evaluation of those functions' contents is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: now_ns() returns current time in nanoseconds as a string; safe_json() serializes data to JSON with exception handling; get_labels() attempts to generate a dictionary of labels, including dynamic labels obtained by calling functions from options.dynamic_labels. The code uses standard modules (json, time) and straightforward logic. No external data sources, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected. The dynamic labels could potentially run arbitrary code if the functions in options.dynamic_labels are malicious, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting those functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for handling time, JSON serialization, and label retrieval. There are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks within this fragment itself. The only potential concern is that dynamic_labels functions could be malicious if provided by untrusted sources, but the code does not itself execute or handle such functions maliciously.",
