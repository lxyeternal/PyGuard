  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating timestamps, safely serializing data to JSON, and retrieving label data, possibly for monitoring or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from options.dynamic_labels, options.labels, and options.app_name.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input leading to data leaks or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The options.dynamic_labels data is processed to generate labels; input data flows into JSON serialization and dictionary construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The dynamic_labels extraction via a lambda may be unusual but is not inherently malicious. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, which might obscure issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The now_ns function generates a high-precision timestamp in nanoseconds, which is standard. The safe_json function attempts to serialize data and returns an empty object string on failure, a common safe fallback. The get_labels function constructs a labels dictionary, merging static and dynamic labels, where dynamic_labels are generated by calling functions stored in options.dynamic_labels. Error handling is broad, catching all exceptions without logging, which could hide errors but not malicious intent. No external network or system modification code is present. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malicious intent in the code structure or logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility functions with no malicious behavior detected. It handles data serialization and label generation safely. The broad exception handling could obscure errors but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign.",
