  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating timestamps, safely serializing data to JSON, and retrieving labels with dynamic content.",
  "sources": "Reading system time via time.time(), reading options.dynamic_labels and options.labels, options.app_name, and calling functions within options.dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps for data serialization, which could potentially be exploited if data is manipulated maliciously before serialization.",
  "flows": "get_labels reads dynamic labels from functions, which are then incorporated into a dictionary and serialized with json.dumps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic_labels with function calls, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if options.dynamic_labels is malicious or improperly validated. Exception handling defaults to empty dict, but no validation of the functions' safety is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions without any direct malicious actions. The 'now_ns' function generates a timestamp in nanoseconds, which is standard. The 'safe_json' function serializes data with exception handling, preventing crashes. The 'get_labels' function attempts to build a labels dictionary by calling functions stored in options.dynamic_labels. If these functions are malicious or unsafe, they could execute arbitrary code, posing a potential security risk, especially if options.dynamic_labels is user-controlled or not validated. Overall, the code itself is not malicious, but the dynamic execution of functions introduces a risk if external inputs are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with no inherent malicious intent. However, the use of dynamic function calls within options.dynamic_labels presents a potential security risk if untrusted code can influence these functions. Proper validation or restrictions should be applied to ensure safety.",
