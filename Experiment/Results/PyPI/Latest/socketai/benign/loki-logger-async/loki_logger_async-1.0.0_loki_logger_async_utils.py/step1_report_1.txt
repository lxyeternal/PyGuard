{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating the current timestamp in nanoseconds, safely serializing data to JSON, and assembling label data from provided options.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current time, data passed into safe_json, and options.dynamic_labels and options.labels.",
  "sinks": "The json.dumps function could potentially be a sink if malicious data is passed, but it is used here safely with exception handling.",
  "flows": "Data from options.dynamic_labels and options.labels flows into get_labels, which processes and combines them into a dictionary, then potentially into JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The functions are straightforward and do not contain hidden or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: 'now_ns' for timestamp, 'safe_json' for safe JSON serialization, and 'get_labels' to assemble label data from an options object. 'now_ns' calculates nanoseconds timestamp, 'safe_json' attempts JSON dumping with exception handling, preventing crashes on unserializable data. 'get_labels' extracts labels from options, with error handling for dynamic labels. All functions perform simple, well-understood operations with no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for timestamping, JSON serialization, and label assembly. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues are evident.",
