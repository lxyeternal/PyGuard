  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with a potential security risk stemming from executing untrusted functions in dynamic_labels. The current scores are appropriate; however, the risk could be slightly increased if dynamic_labels are sourced from untrusted inputs. Proper validation or sandboxing is advised to prevent malicious exploitation."
