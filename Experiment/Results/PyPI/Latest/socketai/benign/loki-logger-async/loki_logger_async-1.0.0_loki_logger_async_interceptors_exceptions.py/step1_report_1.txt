{
  "purpose": "This code sets a custom global exception handler to log uncaught exceptions with a timestamp, then calls the original exception hook.",
  "sources": "Reads exception information from the sys.excepthook mechanism, which captures uncaught exceptions, and accesses logger options for timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Logs exception details into a buffer and flushes logs, potentially writing sensitive exception data into logs.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> custom_hook captures exception -> logs formatted traceback with timestamp -> flushes logs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic retrieval of timestamp via lambda; relies on external logger object. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces sys.excepthook with a custom function that logs uncaught exceptions along with a timestamp retrieved from logger options. It then calls the original hook, preserving default behavior. The use of traceback.format_exception is standard for error logging. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be intended for enhanced error logging in an application, with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception handling and logging. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed to improve error tracking by logging exceptions with timestamps. No anomalies or malware are present.",
