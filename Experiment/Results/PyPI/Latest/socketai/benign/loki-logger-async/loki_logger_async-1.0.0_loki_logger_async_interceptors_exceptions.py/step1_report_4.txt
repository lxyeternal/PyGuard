{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a custom exception hook to log uncaught exceptions with a timestamp and then calls the original exception handler.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; accesses logger options and buffer internally",
  "sinks": "Appends exception details to logger buffer and flushes logs, potentially exposing sensitive data if logger contains such info",
  "flows": "Uncaught exceptions trigger custom_hook, which logs the traceback and then calls the original handler",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected; code structure is straightforward and focused on exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code redefines sys.excepthook to intercept uncaught exceptions, log detailed tracebacks with timestamps, and then proceed with the default exception handling. It depends on an external logger object, which appears to be used for logging purposes. No external data sources, no data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is a typical pattern for enhanced exception logging, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for exception interception and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
