  "sinks": "logger.log_buffer, logger.flush_logs",
  "flows": "Uncaught exception -> custom_hook -> format traceback -> append to log_buffer -> flush logs -> call original excepthook",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; relies on external logger object without evident malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code replaces the global exception handler with a custom function that logs exception details along with a dynamically retrieved timestamp, then calls the original handler. It uses standard traceback formatting and appends logs to a buffer, flushing them afterward. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign error logging, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The logger's configuration could influence data sensitivity, but this is outside the code scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation for enhanced exception logging. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
