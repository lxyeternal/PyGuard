  "purpose": "To intercept unhandled exceptions and log detailed traceback information along with a timestamp.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.excepthook, accessing logger.options.dynamic_labels, and logger.log_buffer",
  "sinks": "Appending exception traceback information to logger.log_buffer and flushing logs",
  "flows": "sys.excepthook -> custom_hook -> logger.log_buffer -> logger.flush_logs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or unusual code behaviors observed; standard exception handling customization.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines sys.excepthook to capture unhandled exceptions, format the traceback, include a timestamp from a logger's dynamic labels, and then logs the exception details. It then calls the original exception hook. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network transmission, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. Usage appears to be for enhanced error logging, which is common in debugging or production monitoring setups. The code does not perform any insecure operations or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard method to enhance exception logging with timestamps. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears intended for improved debugging or monitoring rather than malicious activity.",
