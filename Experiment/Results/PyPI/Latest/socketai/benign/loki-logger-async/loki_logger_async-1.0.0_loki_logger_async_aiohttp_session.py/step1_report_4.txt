  "purpose": "Send log data to a Loki server asynchronously with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reading options.tenant_id, options.auth_token, options.url, and log_buffer.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive headers like Authorization, log_buffer data, and response text if response status is not 204.",
  "flows": "Options fields (tenant_id, auth_token, url) and log_buffer -> HTTP POST request -> server response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code structures. The use of try-except pass could hide errors but is not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a payload with labels obtained from get_labels(options) and log data. It adds an Authorization header if auth_token exists, potentially using a bearer token. The request is made asynchronously with a timeout of 3 seconds. Errors are silently caught and ignored, which could hide issues but doesn't imply malicious intent. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward asynchronous log uploader to Loki with optional authentication. No malicious behavior or supply chain security threats are identified. The silent exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
