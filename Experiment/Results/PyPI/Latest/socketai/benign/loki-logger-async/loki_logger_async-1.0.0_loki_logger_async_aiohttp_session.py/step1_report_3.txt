  "purpose": "Send log data to a Loki server asynchronously with configurable options and headers.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'log_buffer' and 'options' parameters; 'get_labels(options)' function call.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'options.url' using 'aiohttp' with payload and headers.",
  "flows": "get_labels(options) and 'log_buffer' generate payload and headers, which are sent via an HTTP POST request to 'options.url'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a JSON payload with labels and log values, sets headers including tenant ID and optionally an auth token, and performs an asynchronous POST request to a specified URL. It handles exceptions silently, which is a typical pattern for network requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of parameters is straightforward, and no suspicious external behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for asynchronously posting logs to a Loki server. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks within this snippet.",
