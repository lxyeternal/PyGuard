  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to log printed messages with timestamp labels and buffer management.",
  "sources": "Any code calling the built-in print function, which is replaced by custom_print.",
  "sinks": "The logger's log_buffer where messages are stored, and the console output via original_print.",
  "flows": "Built-in print calls -> custom_print -> logger.log_buffer and original_print.",
  "anomalies": "The code intercepts and redirects all print output without explicit validation or restrictions. No external input sources or data validation observed. The logger options include a dynamic label for timestamp, which appears flexible but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to replace Python's default print function with a custom one that logs messages with a timestamp label before printing. It captures the original print function to ensure output still occurs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious external calls are present. The modification affects all print statements, which is common in logging setups. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The code is straightforward and appears intended for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard print interception for logging and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It modifies the built-in print to prepend a timestamp label and buffer the output, which is a common logging pattern. No malware or security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
