{
  "purpose": "The code intercepts the built-in print function to log printed messages with a timestamp and possibly additional context, then proceeds to call the original print function.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the *args parameters passed to the custom_print function, which captures all arguments intended for print.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to logger.log_buffer, which stores log entries, and calls logger._check_flush(), potentially influencing the logging behavior or triggering log operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from print arguments (*args) through the custom_print function, where a message is constructed and appended to log_buffer with a timestamp, then print output is passed to the original print function.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically replaces the built-in print function without explicit control, which could be used to hide or alter output. The logger's methods (_check_flush and log_buffer) are accessed with potential internal or private naming, which might indicate a custom or non-standard logger. No validation or sanitization of print arguments is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a mechanism to intercept and log all print statements in the environment, which can be useful for debugging or monitoring. It uses standard Python features such as builtins and function wrapping. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behavior. However, the replacement of the print function could be misused to hide output or suppress logs if misconfigured. The logger's internal methods and data structures are accessed directly, which could be risky if the logger's implementation is not trusted. Overall, the code appears to be for logging purposes without malicious intent but could be part of a monitoring or debugging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of print interception for logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It modifies global behavior in a way that could be misused to hide output but does not perform any harmful actions itself.",
