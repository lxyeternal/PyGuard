{
  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to log printed messages with a timestamp and store them in a buffer.",
  "sources": "The custom_print function captures all calls to print, which could include user inputs or other data being printed.",
  "sinks": "Appends messages to logger.log_buffer, potentially exposing data in logs. Also, it calls logger._check_flush() which could trigger log writing or other side effects.",
  "flows": "print() calls custom_print() -> constructs message -> appends to log_buffer -> calls _check_flush() -> calls original_print()",
  "anomalies": "Uses monkeypatching of the built-in print function, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No external network activity or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code replaces the default print function with a custom version that logs messages along with a timestamp from logger.options.dynamic_labels. It stores messages in a buffer and then calls a flush check before printing normally. The implementation appears to be for logging or debugging purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The only concern might be if logger.log_buffer or _check_flush() perform unintended actions, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply overrides the print function to add logging functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
