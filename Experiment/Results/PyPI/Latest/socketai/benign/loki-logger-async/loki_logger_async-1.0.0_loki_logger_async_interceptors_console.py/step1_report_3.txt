{
  "purpose": "Override the built-in print function to log printed messages with a timestamp label and buffer management.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'logger' object passed as an argument, specifically accessing 'logger.options.dynamic_labels' and 'logger.log_buffer'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the logged messages are stored in 'logger.log_buffer' which could be accessed later, but no direct data exfiltration or network activity is evident.",
  "flows": "The custom_print function captures print arguments, adds a timestamp from logger options, appends the formatted message to logger.log_buffer, calls a buffer flush check, and then calls the original print function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code replaces the global print function which could be used maliciously if misused, but in itself, it appears as a logging utility.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the built-in print function to intercept all print statements. It retrieves a timestamp label from logger.options.dynamic_labels, which is expected to be a dictionary with callable values. It formats the message and appends it to a log buffer, then invokes a buffer flush check. Finally, it calls the original print function to output the message normally. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code functions as a logging enhancement, potentially used for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging utility that intercepts print statements to log messages with timestamps. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It could be misused if the logger object itself is compromised, but the code as provided is standard for enhancing logging functionality.",
