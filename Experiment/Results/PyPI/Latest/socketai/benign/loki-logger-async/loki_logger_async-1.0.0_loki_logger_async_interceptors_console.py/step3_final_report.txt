{
  "purpose": "Intercepts the built-in print function to log printed messages with timestamps into a logger buffer, then proceeds with normal printing.",
  "sources": "Arguments passed to print (*args), accessed via builtins.print, and logger.options.dynamic_labels.get('timestamp')",
  "sinks": "logger.log_buffer where log entries are stored, and the call to logger._check_flush()",
  "flows": "Print arguments -> custom_print constructs message -> timestamp retrieved -> log_buffer appended -> _check_flush called -> original print executed",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of print arguments; direct access to logger's internal attributes; global override of print function",
  "analysis": "The code replaces the global print function with custom_print, which captures all print arguments, prepends a timestamp obtained from logger.options.dynamic_labels, and appends the message to logger.log_buffer. It then calls logger._check_flush() and finally invokes the original print function. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The main concern is potential misuse for hiding output, but this is typical in debugging or logging utilities. The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign logging utility that intercepts print statements to add timestamped logs. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk stems from the potential misuse of overriding print globally, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
