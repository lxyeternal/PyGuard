  "flows": "check_and_flush -> _schedule_flush or flush_logs -> send_logs -> post_to_loki",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async log buffering with size and interval checks, scheduling flushes via asyncio tasks, and sending logs through an external function. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious activity are evident. External dependencies are assumed legitimate. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common logging practices. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and external network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured asynchronous logging utility with no malicious intent or security flaws. External dependencies are the main vector for potential issues, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk is minimal. The assigned scores are consistent and justified.",
