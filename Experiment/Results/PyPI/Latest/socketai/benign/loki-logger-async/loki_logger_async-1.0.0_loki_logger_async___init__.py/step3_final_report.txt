  "purpose": "Export the LokiLogger class for external use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .loki_logger module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports and exposes a class without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports LokiLogger from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a module initializer or export file. It contains no data flows, network activity, or dynamic code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, with no suspicious patterns or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module export pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
