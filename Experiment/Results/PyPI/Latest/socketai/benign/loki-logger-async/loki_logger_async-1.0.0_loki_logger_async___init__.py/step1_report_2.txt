  "purpose": "This code imports the LokiLogger class from a local module and exposes it for external use, likely as part of a logging or monitoring system.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing loki_logger.LokiLogger from the local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources are present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and declares an API export list. There are no data processing, external data reads, or execution flows that could be malicious. The minimal structure and absence of data handling suggest it is a standard module export statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond exposing the LokiLogger class.",
