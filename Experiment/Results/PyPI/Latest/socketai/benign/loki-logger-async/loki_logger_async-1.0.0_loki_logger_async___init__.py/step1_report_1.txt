  "purpose": "Export the LokiLogger class for external use, likely for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing LokiLogger from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a straightforward import and export statement, no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of importing a class and defining an __all__ export list. There are no data flows, user inputs, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure and content are typical for a module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase for exposing the LokiLogger class.",
