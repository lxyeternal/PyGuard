{
  "purpose": "Defines an export for the LokiLogger class from a local module, likely for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.loki_logger import LokiLogger).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink identified; no external data handling or output found.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes an export.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named LokiLogger from a local module and sets __all__ to expose this class. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other actions that could indicate malicious activity. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup for exposing a logger class, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
