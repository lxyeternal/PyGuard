{
  "purpose": "Exports the LokiLogger class for external use, likely as part of a logging framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .loki_logger",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow, only module import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named LokiLogger from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use. No data input, external communication, or data processing occurs here. The structure is typical for a module's __init__.py or similar. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving solely as an export declaration for a logger class. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
