{
  "purpose": "The code defines a LokiLogger class responsible for capturing events and flushing logs asynchronously. It integrates interceptors for exceptions, logging, and print, and registers a flush on program exit.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (event_name, properties) and internal method calls (now_ns, safe_json, interceptors, log_buffer).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send or process untrusted data to external systems; no explicit sinks for network or file output are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into log message construction; log_buffer stores data; flush_logs copies and clears buffer; send_logs transmits logs via the flush_manager.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Use of interceptors suggests behavior modification but is not suspicious on its own.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger object that intercepts standard output and exceptions, buffers logs, and flushes them asynchronously. The use of 'atexit' to ensure logs are flushed on program exit is standard. The functions 'now_ns' and 'safe_json' are utilities that likely handle timestamping and JSON serialization securely. No external data is read directly from untrusted sources, and no malicious network activity or data leaks are apparent. The overall structure and code are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard logging implementation with appropriate safety measures and no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
