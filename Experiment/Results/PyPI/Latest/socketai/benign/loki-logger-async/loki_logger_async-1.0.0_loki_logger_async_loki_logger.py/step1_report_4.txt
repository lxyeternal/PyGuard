{
  "purpose": "The code implements a LokiLogger class for logging events with buffering and flushing capabilities, including interceptors for exceptions, print, and logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data mainly from method parameters (event_name, properties) and internal state (log_buffer). It also uses external functions (now_ns, safe_json).",
  "sinks": "Data is stored temporarily in log_buffer and then sent via flush_manager.send_logs, which could potentially send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from track_event method into log_buffer, then upon flush_logs, it is sent through send_logs. Interceptors may also modify or log data during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or unusual code constructs detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. Interceptors' implementations are not shown but appear to be standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical logging utility designed for event tracking, with asynchronous flushing and interceptors for exception, print, and logging capture. No malicious behavior is evident. Data handling appears standard. External modules like interceptors and utils are not provided, but based on imports and usage, they seem intended for standard interception and utility functions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign logging implementation without signs of malicious intent or security risks. It effectively manages event logging with buffering and interceptors, with no malicious behavior or supply chain risks detected.",
