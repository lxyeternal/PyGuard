  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries holding labels; 'DynamicLabels' maps strings to callable functions returning any value, 'FixedLabels' maps strings to fixed strings.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard typing constructs; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints, then defines two type aliases for dictionaries. 'DynamicLabels' associates strings with functions that return any type, which could be used for dynamic label generation. 'FixedLabels' associates strings with fixed string values. There is no complex logic, data manipulation, or I/O operations. The code appears to serve as type annotations for use elsewhere, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet that defines type aliases for labeling dictionaries. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
