{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for label mappings, one dynamic with callable values and one fixed with string values.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or handling that could lead to leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward type alias definitions with no unusual constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations for dictionaries with specified key-value types. There are no function calls, data manipulations, or data flows. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of typing hints for flexible label mappings is typical in Python projects and poses no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward type alias declarations with no malicious intent or security risks.",
