  "purpose": "Definition of type aliases for label mappings with callable and string values.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or processing of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two type aliases: DynamicLabels as a dictionary with string keys and callable values returning any type, and FixedLabels as a dictionary with string keys and string values. There are no function calls, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward type alias declaration without logic or runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type hinting convenience and does not contain or perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
