  "purpose": "Define type aliases for label dictionaries with dynamic and fixed string values",
  "sources": "Type annotations import, assignment of type aliases",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward type alias definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for dictionaries; 'DynamicLabels' maps strings to callable objects returning any type, and 'FixedLabels' maps strings to strings. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks. The code is minimal, clear, and appears to serve as type hints without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No complex logic, no external data handling, no potential for malicious flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign type alias definition with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation present.",
