  "purpose": "Type alias definitions for labeling dictionaries in Python code, serving as type hints.",
  "sources": "No data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic code execution; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code contains only type alias declarations without data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two type aliases: 'DynamicLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and callable values, and 'FixedLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and string values. The code is minimal, correct, and used for type hinting. No data flows, external interactions, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of type alias declarations with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
