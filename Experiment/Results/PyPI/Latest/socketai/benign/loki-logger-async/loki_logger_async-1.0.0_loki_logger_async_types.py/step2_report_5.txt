  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simple type alias definitions using Python's typing module.\n   - The original code snippet defines:\n     ```python\n     from typing import Callable, Dict, Any\n\n     DynamicLabels = Dict[str, Callable[[], Any]]\n     FixedLabels = Dict[str, str]\n     ```\n   - There are no functions, data processing, data input/output, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only declares type aliases with no runtime behavior or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence that the code is benign)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely type alias declarations, which are safe.\n   - No runtime code, no external data, no dynamic execution.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the code's nature—simple type alias declarations with no runtime behavior, data handling, or external interactions—there's no reason to assign any higher scores. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
