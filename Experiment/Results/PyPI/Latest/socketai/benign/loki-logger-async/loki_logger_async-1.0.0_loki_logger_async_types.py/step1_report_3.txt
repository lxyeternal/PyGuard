  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries mapping strings to functions or strings, likely for labeling purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations detected.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only type alias definitions; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations using Python's typing module. It defines 'DynamicLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and callable values returning any type, and 'FixedLabels' as a dictionary with string keys and string values. There are no functions, data input/output, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected in this minimal and straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign type alias declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not involve data processing or external interactions, thus presenting no security risks.",
