  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple type alias definitions for dictionaries, with no data input/output, no function calls, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, minimal, and serve as type hints.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or complex logic are present.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code defines two type aliases:\n  - `DynamicLabels = Dict[str, Callable[[], Any]]`\n  - `FixedLabels = Dict[str, str]`\n- These are standard typing constructs used for labeling purposes, likely in larger codebases.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- Given the simplicity and clarity, there are no grounds to increase scores or suspect malicious activity.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\n- The code is purely type alias declarations, serving as type hints.\n- No data flows, no external interactions, no suspicious patterns.\n- The high confidence and consistent findings across reports support a benign classification.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. I recommend maintaining the scores as they are: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0**.",
