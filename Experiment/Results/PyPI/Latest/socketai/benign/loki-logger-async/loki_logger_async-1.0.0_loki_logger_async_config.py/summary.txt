  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration class with no malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for misuse of dynamic_labels containing callables, which could execute arbitrary code if invoked improperly. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found. The overall security risk is low but slightly elevated due to the flexibility of dynamic_labels."
