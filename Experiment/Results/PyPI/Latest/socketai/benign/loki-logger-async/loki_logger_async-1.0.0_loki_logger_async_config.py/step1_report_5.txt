{
  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logger, including connection details, authentication, batching, and labeling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned directly to instance variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of Optional for auth_token and dynamic labels is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for configuration options with an initializer setting various attributes. Parameters like url, tenant_id, and auth_token could contain sensitive data but are passed as arguments, not hardcoded. The use of optional types and default empty dictionaries is typical. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The class appears to be straightforward and secure in its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for Loki logging options with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles sensitive data via parameters but does not store or process it insecurely. Overall, it appears safe.",
