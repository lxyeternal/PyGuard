  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logger, including connection details and labels.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor parameters: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, and label values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes without further processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. Usage of optional auth_token suggests flexibility but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for configuring Loki logging, initializing attributes with provided parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious logic. The auth_token is optional, which is typical for authentication mechanisms. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It handles sensitive data carefully by making auth_token optional, but otherwise, it does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
