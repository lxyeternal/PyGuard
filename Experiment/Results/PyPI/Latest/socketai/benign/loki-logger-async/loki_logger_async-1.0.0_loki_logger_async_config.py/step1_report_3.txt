{
  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logger, including connection details, authentication, batching, and labels.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are provided via constructor parameters: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, and dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the URL for logging, tenant_id, app_name, and auth_token, which could be misused if exposed or mishandled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into instance variables. No untrusted input flows directly into sensitive operations or external systems within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of optional dynamic labels via callables is standard and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that assigns provided parameters to instance variables. The auth_token and URL could be sensitive if exposed, but no code manipulates or transmits them here. The inclusion of dynamic labels allows runtime label generation, which is flexible but not suspicious. There are no obfuscated patterns, external network calls, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for logging options, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It manages configuration data securely within the scope of the class definition.",
