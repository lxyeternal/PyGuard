{
  "purpose": "Define configuration options for a Loki logger, including connection details, labels, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include constructor parameters: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as url, tenant_id, app_name, and auth_token could be exposed or misused if improperly handled or transmitted insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into instance attributes; no external data flow or network operations are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container for logger configuration with optional parameters. It initializes attributes from provided arguments, defaulting to empty dictionaries for labels and dynamic_labels if not supplied. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. No external calls or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple configuration class without malicious intent or security issues. It handles configuration data securely by avoiding hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
