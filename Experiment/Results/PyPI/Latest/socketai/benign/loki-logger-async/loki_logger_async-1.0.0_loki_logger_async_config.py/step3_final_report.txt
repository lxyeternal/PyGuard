  "sources": "Constructor parameters: url, tenant_id, app_name, auth_token, labels, dynamic_labels",
  "sinks": "Potential invocation of callables stored in dynamic_labels if used elsewhere, leading to arbitrary code execution",
  "flows": "Storage of parameters in class attributes; no direct execution or data flow to external systems within this code",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic_labels accepting callables, which could execute arbitrary code if invoked without validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with parameters for Loki logging. The main concern is that dynamic_labels can hold functions, which, if maliciously supplied, could execute arbitrary code when called. The class itself does not execute these callables; the risk depends on how and where they are invoked. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and safe in isolation, but the potential misuse of dynamic_labels warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration class with no malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for misuse of dynamic_labels containing callables, which could execute arbitrary code if invoked improperly. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found. The overall security risk is low but slightly elevated due to the flexibility of dynamic_labels.",
