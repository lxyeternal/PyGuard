{
  "purpose": "The code manages data loading, mathematical operations, object serialization, and visualization, primarily for structural analysis or similar applications.",
  "sources": "File dialogs for selecting pickle files, CSV/JSON data files, and image files; untrusted pickle files loaded via pickle.load() in methods _open_object and _open_multiple_objects.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted pickle files loaded into pickle.load(), which can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.",
  "flows": "File dialog retrieves file path -> open file in binary mode -> pickle.load() deserializes data -> potential execution of malicious code if file is untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load() without validation or sandboxing, which is inherently risky; no validation or signature verification implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pickle.load() to deserialize objects from files selected via GUI dialogs without any validation, signature check, or sandboxing, exposing a high security risk if untrusted files are loaded. No malicious code or obfuscation is present; the main concern is the potential for remote code execution through malicious pickle files. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this risk, with malware scores at 0 and risk scores ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 depending on the perceived threat level. Given the known security issues with pickle, the risk should be considered high unless safeguards are implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious code or obfuscation but employs unsafe deserialization practices that pose a significant security risk. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be elevated to reflect the danger of executing untrusted pickle files. Implementing validation, signature verification, or replacing pickle with safer serialization methods is strongly recommended.",
