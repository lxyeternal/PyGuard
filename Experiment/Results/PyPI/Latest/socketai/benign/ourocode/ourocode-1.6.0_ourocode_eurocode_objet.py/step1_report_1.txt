  "purpose": "This code provides a class for managing objects related to structural data, including loading and saving data, performing mathematical operations, and handling physical units, primarily for structural analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include CSV and JSON files loaded via _data_from_csv and _data_from_json methods; file dialogs for saving and opening objects; and potential user inputs via get_value method.",
  "sinks": "Serialization and deserialization of objects through pickle files (save_object, _save_muliple_objects, _open_object, _open_multiple_objects), which could potentially execute malicious code if a malicious pickle file is loaded.",
  "flows": "User input via file dialogs flows into loading methods (open, load), which deserialize objects from pickle files. Data from CSV/JSON files flows into data processing methods. Mathematical operations are performed on provided values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for object serialization/deserialization poses security risks if untrusted files are loaded; no validation or signature checks are present. The code includes broad exception handling without specific error processing. Potentially unnecessary or risky use of dynamic imports and reflection in _reset_physical_dictionnary. No explicit input validation or security controls for file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates loading and saving Python objects via pickle, which is inherently risky if files are untrusted, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. The class methods that handle pickle loading (e.g., _open_object, _open_multiple_objects) do not verify file integrity or authenticity, creating a high security concern. Other parts of the code perform mathematical computations and unit conversions without evident security flaws. No network activity, system modification, or suspicious domain interactions are detected. The use of importlib.resources, os, and pandas appears standard. The method get_value parses JSON strings with string replacement but does not involve malicious code. Overall, the main concern is the use of pickle with unverified files, which can lead to remote code execution if malicious pickle files are loaded.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain explicit malicious behavior or backdoors. However, the reliance on pickle for object serialization/deserialization introduces a significant security risk if untrusted pickle files are loaded. No other malicious indicators, such as network activity or data exfiltration, are present. The overall security risk is moderate to high due to unsafe object deserialization practices.",
