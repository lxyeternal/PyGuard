  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious code or obfuscation but employs unsafe deserialization practices that pose a significant security risk. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be elevated to reflect the danger of executing untrusted pickle files. Implementing validation, signature verification, or replacing pickle with safer serialization methods is strongly recommended."
