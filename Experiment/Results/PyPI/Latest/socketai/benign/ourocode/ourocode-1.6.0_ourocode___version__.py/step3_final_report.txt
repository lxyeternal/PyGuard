  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to __version__, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the assignment is straightforward and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a simple, static string assignment with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no functions, data handling, external interactions, or obfuscation. The code is minimal, standard, and benign. All review reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or potential vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
