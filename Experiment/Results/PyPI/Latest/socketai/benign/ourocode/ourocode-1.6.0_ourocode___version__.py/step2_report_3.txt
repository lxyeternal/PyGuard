  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n   - The conclusions about benignity and lack of malicious behavior are justified.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The risk scores correctly reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code's simplicity makes it impossible for it to be malicious or obfuscated. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
