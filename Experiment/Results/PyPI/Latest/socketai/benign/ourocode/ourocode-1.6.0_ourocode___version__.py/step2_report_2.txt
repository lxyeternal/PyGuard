  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and compare their findings with the original code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, flows, or suspicious behaviors in the original code.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which aligns with the assessment that the code is harmless.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a standard version string assignment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code snippet is a simple, standard version string assignment with no data flows, external interactions, or suspicious patterns. All reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Estimated scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**\n\nThere are no security concerns here.",
