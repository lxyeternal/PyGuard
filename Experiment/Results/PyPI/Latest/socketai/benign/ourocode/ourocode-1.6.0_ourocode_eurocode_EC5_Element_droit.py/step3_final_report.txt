{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for structural analysis of timber elements based on EN 1995 standards, utilizing CSV data for material properties and performing calculations for various load and safety checks.",
  "sources": "CSV files such as 'caracteristique_meca_bois.csv', 'kmod.csv', 'limite_fleche.csv' for mechanical properties, load factors, and geometric data.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, system commands, or data exfiltration; data flows from CSVs into class attributes and calculation functions.",
  "flows": "CSV data into class attributes, then through mathematical computations and decorators for display; no dynamic code execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns; decorators are used solely for display purposes, not malicious code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, purpose-specific, relying on external CSV data for properties, performing standard calculations for timber structural analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The use of decorators is for presentation, not code execution. No network activity or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, domain-specific structural analysis tool for timber elements, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It is transparent, purpose-driven, and safe for use.",
