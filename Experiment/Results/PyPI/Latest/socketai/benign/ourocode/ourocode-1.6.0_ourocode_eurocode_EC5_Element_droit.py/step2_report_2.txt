  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** The code is for structural calculations based on EN 1995, reading data from CSV files (e.g., 'caracteristique_meca_bois.csv', 'kmod.csv', 'limite_fleche.csv').\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from CSVs into class attributes, then through mathematical calculations. No external network, system commands, or data exfiltration are involved.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or network calls. The use of 'handcalc' decorators is for display purposes, not malicious code.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate structural analysis tool, with standard data handling and calculations. No malicious behavior or sabotage signs. The high confidence (0.95) and malware score (0) support this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it reads characteristic data from CSV files for timber properties, no suspicious data sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard—CSV data into class attributes, calculations for stresses and safety checks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** No code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity. Some print statements in methods (e.g., in Kv) are for debugging, not malicious.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured structural analysis module. No signs of malicious intent. Confidence is perfect (1.0), malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Extensive classes for timber structural analysis, relying on CSV files for characteristic data, no suspicious sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from CSVs and user inputs into calculations; no external communication or data leaks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** No obfuscation, no code injection, no network activity. Decorators are for display only.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, purpose-driven, and free of malicious behavior. Confidence is high (1.0), malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to previous, reading characteristic data from CSVs, performing standard calculations.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are from CSVs and parameters into calculations; no external transmission or malicious code.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** No obfuscation, no network activity, no code injection. Decorators are for display.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate engineering code, safe from malicious activity. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Structural analysis classes, CSV data for material properties, no suspicious sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data flow, no external network or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:** No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network calls. Decorators are for display.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard engineering code, no malicious signs. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Behavior & Data Handling:** All reports describe code that reads from CSV files containing material and mechanical data, performs calculations, and displays results. No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Use of 'handcalc' is for display, not malicious.\n\n- **Security Risks:** Very low. The code is purpose-built for structural analysis, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. Risk scores are also low, consistent with the data.\n\n- **Obfuscated & Malware Scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Potential for Hidden Malicious Code:** None detected. The code relies on external CSVs and standard libraries, with no dynamic or network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or hidden code patterns.\n\n**Risk Score:** ~0.1 to 0.2 — Very low, given the purpose and data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe entire codebase appears to be a legitimate, purpose-driven structural analysis tool for timber elements, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It relies on external CSV data, performs standard calculations, and uses decorators for display purposes only. No security concerns are evident.\n\n**Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** ~0.1 (very low)  \n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the safety and integrity of the code from a security perspective.",
