{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and methods for structural analysis of wooden elements, including calculating sections, resistances, and behavior under loads, primarily for engineering purposes related to EN 1995 standards.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data files (characteristics, kmod, gammaM, limite_fleche, etc.), user input parameters (dimensions, material classes, load types), and attributes like humidity and load conditions.",
  "sinks": "Calculates and returns structural parameters such as section properties, resistances, and stress states; no data is sent over a network or written externally; no code injection or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "User inputs or parameters feed into class constructors and methods, which compute properties and resistances; data files are loaded and used to determine mechanical characteristics; calculations depend on these data and inputs, with results stored in object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code includes extensive use of external data files and calculation functions but no suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as network communication, file modification, or system commands. The presence of plotting and commented-out classes does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes representing structural elements, with methods for calculating physical properties and stresses based on input parameters and external CSV data. No code sections perform operations that could harm the system or exfiltrate data. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The calculations appear to be standard for structural analysis, with no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate engineering analysis module for wooden structural elements, based on standard calculations and external data files. It does not contain malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
