  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, data flow, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes classes for structural calculations based on CSV data. Data flows from CSVs into class attributes and methods; no external system commands or network calls.\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No suspicious sinks; uses decorators for display, not malicious code. No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is well-structured, performing standard calculations for timber elements, relying on external CSVs. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate structural analysis code, safe, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, mainly due to external data dependency).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on structural analysis with CSV data.\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No network or system commands; extensive use of CSVs; no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation for timber analysis; no malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 (very low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data:** Same domain, multiple classes for timber elements, reading characteristic data from CSVs.\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No network, no code injection, no secrets; decorators for display only.\n- **Analysis:** All standard calculations; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly legitimate engineering code, safe.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data:** Similar, focusing on structural calculations with external CSV data.\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No external communication, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, domain-specific calculations; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low security risk.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data:** Same pattern—structural analysis based on CSVs.\n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No network/system calls; no obfuscation; data sources are characteristic data.\n- **Analysis:** Standard engineering calculations, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. **Consensus: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected. **Consensus: 0.0**\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is purely computational, relies on external CSV data, and contains no malicious patterns, the risk is minimal. Slightly higher in some reports due to external data dependency, but overall very low.\n\n### My Final Estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear, structured, and transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — mainly due to reliance on external CSV data, but not malicious.\n\n**In conclusion**, this code is a legitimate, domain-specific structural analysis tool for timber elements, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. It appears to be well-designed for its purpose, with high confidence in its safety.",
