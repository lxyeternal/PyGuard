  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for calculating various structural properties and safety checks for wooden beams and elements based on EN 1995 standards, including sections, inertias, resistance factors, and load ratios.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from CSV files (e.g., 'caracteristique_meca_bois.csv', 'kmod.csv', 'limite_fleche.csv') using class methods; uses input parameters like dimensions, loads, and material classes; and extracts data from class attributes and CSV files throughout the classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of untrusted input data to compute resistance and load ratios, but all data sources are CSV files and class attributes; no direct data leakage, system commands, or network connections are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV files into class attributes and methods, then through calculations involving parameters like dimensions, material properties, and loads. Calculations involve property accesses, CSV lookups, and mathematical operations that are standard for structural analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or code that performs network operations. The use of 'handcalc' decorators is for display and documentation purposes, not malicious. No backdoors or privacy violations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured with clear class hierarchies and logical data flow. Data is loaded from CSV files for mechanical characteristics, and calculations follow standard structural engineering formulas. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data handling is found. The code relies on external CSV data and standard Python libraries; no external network calls, code injections, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate structural analysis tool for wooden elements, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It reads data from trusted CSV files, performs standard calculations, and uses decorators for display purposes only. Overall, it is safe and purpose-driven for engineering calculations.",
