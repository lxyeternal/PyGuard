{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for structural analysis of wooden elements, including calculations for sections, strength, and stability according to EN 1995 standards.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV files (e.g., caracteristique_meca_bois.csv, kmod.csv, gammaM.csv, limite_fleche.csv, etc.) and user-provided parameters such as dimensions, loads, and material classes.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations on input parameters and CSV data; does not include explicit data leaks or network transmissions. No code injection, database access, or external data transmission is detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV file reads and input parameters into class properties and methods, then through calculations involving mathematical operations. No untrusted input flows directly into dangerous sinks like system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code patterns; no use of dynamic code execution like eval or exec; no hidden backdoors or malicious logic. Some print statements (e.g., in Kv method) are for debugging but are not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements structural calculations for timber elements following EN standards, utilizing CSV data for material properties and parameters. Functions are well-structured with property decorators and helper methods. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, file manipulation beyond reading CSVs, or code injection mechanisms. The use of handcalc decorator is for calculation display, not for executing arbitrary code. The overall code appears to be a legitimate engineering analysis module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate structural analysis module for timber elements, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily reads configuration data, performs calculations, and displays results. No suspicious or harmful code patterns are present.",
