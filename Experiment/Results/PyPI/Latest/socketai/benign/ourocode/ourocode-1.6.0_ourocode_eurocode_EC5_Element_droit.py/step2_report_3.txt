  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Describes classes for structural calculations based on EN 1995, reading CSV files for mechanical data, loads, and characteristics.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; data flows from CSVs and class attributes into calculations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. Use of 'handcalc' decorators is for display, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, standard for structural analysis, and appears legitimate. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Very high confidence this is a legitimate engineering tool with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar focus on structural analysis, reading characteristic CSVs, no suspicious data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, data leaks, or code injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns. Use of 'handcalc' for display is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, legitimate purpose, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear and trustworthy; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Extensive classes for timber analysis, reading characteristic CSVs, performing physics-based calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or data exfiltration; calculations are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code. Decorators are for display, not code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate structural analysis code, domain-specific, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** High confidence in safety; code appears purpose-driven and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar structure, reading characteristic data, performing calculations for timber elements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. Decorators for display are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard engineering code, safe, with no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (still very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Likely safe; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Classes for structural analysis, reading characteristic CSVs, performing calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code. Use of decorators is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate domain-specific code, safe to use.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators; appears to be a standard engineering module.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is domain-specific, reading from CSVs, performing standard calculations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no malware or obfuscation (scores 0). No hidden malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, primarily due to external data reliance but not malicious.\n- **Behavior & Logic:** Consistent with legitimate structural analysis software, no suspicious activity, network calls, or data leaks.\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, considering external data dependencies but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, domain-specific structural analysis tool for timber elements based on EN standards. It reads data from CSV files, performs standard calculations, and displays results for engineering purposes. No signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Please proceed with confidence in the safety of this code.**",
