{
  "purpose": "The code implements fire resistance calculations for wooden structural elements, relying on external data (CSV files), external libraries, and class attributes to perform physics-based engineering computations related to fire safety standards.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data files, accesses class attributes, and uses external libraries such as 'forallpeople', 'handcalcs', and 'ourocode' for calculations and display.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file writing beyond internal data handling; no malicious commands or code injection detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (CSV, class attributes) through calculation functions, decorators for display, and internal data structures, with no external communication or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hidden code patterns; code is well-structured and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code performs physics-based fire resistance calculations for wooden elements, utilizing external data and libraries legitimately. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The use of decorators like 'handcalc' is for inline calculation display, typical in scientific notebooks. The code is domain-specific, transparent, and adheres to standard engineering practices. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific engineering calculation library for fire resistance analysis with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its external data dependencies and calculation complexity.",
