  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific engineering calculation library for fire resistance analysis with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its external data dependencies and calculation complexity."
