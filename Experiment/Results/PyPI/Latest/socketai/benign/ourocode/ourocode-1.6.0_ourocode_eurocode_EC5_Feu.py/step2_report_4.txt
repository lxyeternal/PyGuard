  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Structural fire resistance calculations for wood elements per EN standards.\n- **Sources:** Reads CSV data, accesses class attributes, uses external libraries.\n- **Sinks:** No external data transmission or code injection.\n- **Flows:** Standard data flow from inputs to calculations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; code appears standard.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate domain-specific calculations, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Similar focus: fire behavior of wooden elements, detailed calculations, external data via CSV.\n- No suspicious behaviors, no external network activity, no obfuscation.\n- Uses external libraries appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Focus on structural fire analysis, loading external data, performing physics calculations.\n- No network, file writes, or suspicious code.\n- Well-structured, domain-specific.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Defines classes for fire resistance, loads data, performs calculations.\n- No malicious behaviors, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- Purpose aligns with engineering analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Similar purpose: fire resistance calculations, data from CSV, external modules.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Focused on physics/engineering computations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports describe code that performs complex, domain-specific calculations related to fire resistance of wooden structures. The code reads data from CSV files, uses external libraries (e.g., 'forallpeople', 'handcalcs', 'ourocode'), and employs decorators for display purposes. These are typical in engineering computation tools.\n\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or dynamic execution beyond standard calculation wrappers. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns are observed.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Security Risks:** All reports assign obfuscation=0 and very low security risks, consistent with transparent, domain-specific scientific code.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores assigned (mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2 for risk, 0 for malware and obfuscation) are reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear, domain-specific, and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of calculations and data handling, a **low risk score (~0.1-0.2)** remains appropriate. The only potential concern is if external CSV data could be untrusted, but that’s typical in engineering tools, and no evidence suggests manipulation or malicious data.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, domain-specific engineering tool for fire resistance analysis of wooden structures. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided reports. The low risk score is justified by its external data dependencies and calculation complexity, which are standard in such applications.\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring for any dynamic or runtime behaviors if deploying in sensitive environments, but based on current analysis, the code is safe.",
