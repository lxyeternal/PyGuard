  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements fire resistance calculations for wooden elements, reading data from CSVs, accessing class attributes, and external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data flow; no external data leaks or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; external libraries are legitimate.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs physics-based calculations with external data and decorators for display. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate engineering code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low, due to domain-specific calculations).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on fire behavior calculations, reading CSVs, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system communication, only internal calculations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Domain-specific physics calculations, standard external library use, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, specialized scientific code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Structural fire analysis, with external data, class attributes, and calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hidden or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Focused on physics/engineering calculations, standard library use, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid scientific/engineering code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on fire resistance, with external data, detailed class methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Clear calculations, external libraries for display and math, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate engineering software.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Fire-resistance calculations, reading CSVs, performing physics-based computations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Focused on physics and data handling, standard for such tools.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, domain-specific code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate **0**. The code performs domain-specific calculations, reads data from CSVs, and uses external libraries legitimately. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate **0**. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher than 0.1-0.2, mainly because the code involves complex calculations and external data handling, but these are standard in engineering software. No indications of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the complexity and external data dependencies, but still very low risk overall.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The use of 'handcalc' decorators is for display purposes, typical in Jupyter notebooks, not malicious.\n- External data sources and libraries are used appropriately for engineering calculations.\n- No signs of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The code is domain-specific, focused on structural fire safety analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-designed engineering calculation library with no security threats or malicious intent. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, but monitor for any future obfuscation or unexpected external communications if the codebase evolves.",
