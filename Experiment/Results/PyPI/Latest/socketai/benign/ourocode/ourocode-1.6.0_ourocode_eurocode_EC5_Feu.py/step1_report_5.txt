{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for fire-resistance calculations of wooden structural elements, including beams, considering various fire protection and exposure scenarios, as well as related mechanical properties.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration and property data from CSV files and internal class attributes, and importing external modules for calculations.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data leaks, network calls, or system modifications are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input properties and external CSV data into calculation methods, with intermediate results stored in class attributes; no untrusted data flows directly to system or network effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code predominantly performs calculations and data handling without suspicious behavior. The use of external modules is standard for engineering calculations.",
  "analysis": "The script implements complex structural fire resistance calculations for wooden elements, including properties, time-dependent carbonization, and protection effects. It imports modules and CSV data, performs mathematical interpolations, and uses a decorator 'handcalc' for display purposes. No signs of code injection, malicious system calls, or data exfiltration are evident. The overall structure and logic focus on engineering calculations with proper data management and no suspicious dynamic code execution or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and specialized structural engineering calculation module with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data reading, mathematical computations, and property management in a standard manner, aligned with its engineering purpose.",
