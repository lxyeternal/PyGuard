  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a detailed fire resistance calculation code for wooden elements, reading CSV data, and using external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks, network activity, or code injection; standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious commands. The code uses external libraries legitimately for engineering calculations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate engineering code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on fire behavior of wooden elements, reading CSV, external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; calculations are physics-based.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focus on structural fire analysis, external data, and calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose—fire safety analysis with detailed class structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external file operations beyond data input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, standard calculations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Fire-resistance calculations, reading CSV, external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code. The code is domain-specific and well-structured.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that performs engineering calculations for fire resistance of wooden structures. They read data from CSV files, perform mathematical computations, and use external libraries for display and calculation purposes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, malicious commands, or obfuscation are evident across all reports.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated 0, and risks are low (~0.1–0.2), which is consistent with the technical nature of the code.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the use of `handcalc`, which is for inline calculation display in Jupyter environments—this is standard for such tools and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the domain-specific, calculation-heavy nature, a low risk score (~0.1–0.2) is justified, reflecting minimal security threat.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific engineering calculation library with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.",
