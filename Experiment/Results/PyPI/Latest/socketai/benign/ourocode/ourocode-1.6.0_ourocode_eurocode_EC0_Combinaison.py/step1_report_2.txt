{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class Combinaison used for generating and managing load combinations for structural analysis, specifically in a civil engineering context, with detailed methods for creating load scenarios and handling data related to structural loads.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from CSV files via _data_from_csv and from the get_all_loads() method of the model_generator object. It also reads from the alt.value attribute, which suggests user input or external data influencing calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code performs data manipulations and creates DataFrames; it does not execute any system commands, network calls, or file write operations. There are no explicit sinks that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources (CSV, get_all_loads(), alt.value) into various calculations and data structures. The flows primarily involve loading and processing load data, and generating combinations stored in class attributes or DataFrames. There is no evidence of data flowing into dangerous system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out code and code comments that are benign. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. Usage of external libraries numpy and pandas are standard for data manipulation. No backdoors, hidden functions, or malicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "A comprehensive review of the code reveals it is a structured implementation for load combination generation in structural engineering. It employs standard data processing libraries (numpy, pandas), and performs calculations based on input data, configuration flags, and external CSV files. No code segments perform network communication, file writing, command execution, or any action that could harm or compromise the system. The commented-out code and structure do not suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be legitimate application logic related to civil engineering computations, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate application module for load combination calculations, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard libraries and practices for data handling, with no suspicious operations detected. Overall, the risk of malware or security issues from this code is extremely low.",
