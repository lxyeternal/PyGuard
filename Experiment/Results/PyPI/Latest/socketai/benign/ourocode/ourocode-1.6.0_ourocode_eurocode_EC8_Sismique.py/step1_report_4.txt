{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line indicating the script should be run with a specific Python interpreter located at env\\Scripts\\python.exe and specifies UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sources": "The shebang line at the beginning of the script",
  "sinks": "There are no data processing or untrusted data handling points in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only specifies execution environment and encoding",
  "anomalies": "The shebang path uses a Windows-style relative path with backslashes, which may be non-standard but is not inherently malicious. No other unusual code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet consists solely of a shebang line and an encoding comment. It does not include executable code, data handling, or potentially malicious commands. The shebang specifies a local virtual environment interpreter, which is common in Python projects. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify the interpreter and encoding. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected in this snippet.",
