  "purpose": "Shebang line specifying the Python interpreter within a virtual environment, with a comment about encoding.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself, reading the interpreter path.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the shebang line is a static script header.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional Windows-style backslash path in shebang; no executable code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is merely a shebang line pointing to 'env\\Scripts\\python.exe' with a comment about UTF-8 encoding. No executable code, data processing, or malicious behavior is present. The Windows-style path is non-standard but not malicious; it may cause execution issues on some systems but does not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the snippet. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities exists. The only minor concern is the path format, which is a configuration issue rather than a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The snippets are harmless shebang lines specifying the interpreter path in a Windows environment. They contain no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
