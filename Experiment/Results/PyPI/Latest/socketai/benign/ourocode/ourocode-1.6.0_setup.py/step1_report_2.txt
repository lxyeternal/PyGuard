{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup parameters for the Python package 'ourocode', including metadata, package data, and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from 'ourocode/__version__.py' and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data; no network, file writes, or execution of untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file -> uses data in setup() parameters; reads README content for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info can be risky if the file content is malicious, but in this context, it appears controlled and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It executes reading the version from a separate file using exec(), which is common but can be dangerous if the file contents are malicious or altered. The rest of the code specifies package metadata and data files, which are standard. There are no suspicious network connections, code injections, or malicious data handling present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior detected. The use of exec() for version loading warrants a note but is typical in package setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for reading the version, which should be safe if the version file is controlled and unmodified.",
