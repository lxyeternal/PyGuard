{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'ourocode' with metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'ourocode/__version__.py', reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The version information from '__version__.py' is executed and assigned; no external data flows to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute contents of '__version__.py', which can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with. However, if the '__version__.py' is controlled and trusted, this is a standard pattern for dynamic version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'exec' to read version info, which can be a security concern if the '__version__.py' file is compromised. Otherwise, the rest of the setup configuration appears standard and safe. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. There are no network connections, no data leaks, and no dangerous code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical package setup procedures with a potentially risky use of 'exec' for version reading. If the version file is trusted and controlled, the risk is minimal. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
