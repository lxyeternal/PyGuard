  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same setup script for the 'ourocode' package.\n- The core concern across reports is the use of `exec()` to read the version from `__version__.py`.\n- They agree that the rest of the setup code is standard and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are generally high (0.8-0.9), indicating that the reviewers believe the code is mostly benign with a minor security concern.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no evidence of malicious code.\n- Security risks are rated low (~0.1-0.3), mainly due to the use of `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The use of `exec()` to load version info is a known pattern but can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- No other issues, such as untrusted data sinks, network activity, or obfuscation, are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The primary flaw is the reliance on `exec()` for reading a static version file. While common, it can execute malicious code if the version file is tampered with.\n- No other code flaws or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code is detected.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent across reports.\n- Risk: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, which seems reasonable given the `exec()` concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which aligns with the fact that the only concern is the `exec()` usage, a known but relatively low-risk pattern if files are trusted.\n- The risk scores seem appropriately conservative.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly set to 0; no malware is detected or implied.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports assume that if the version file is compromised, malicious code could be executed. This is a valid concern but depends on file trustworthiness.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about malware are made.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the setup script is standard with a minor security concern related to `exec()`.**  \n**No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident.**  \n**The main recommendation is to replace `exec()` with a safer alternative, such as reading the version string directly or importing the version module in a controlled manner.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `exec()` usage, but minimal if the version file is trusted)\n\n**Final note:** The code is typical for package setup scripts. The only improvement is to avoid `exec()` for security reasons, but this does not change the overall benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is generally safe and standard.\n- The only concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which should be replaced with a safer method.\n- No malware or malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Replace `exec()` with a safer approach, such as:\n  ```python\n  version = {}\n  with open(\"ourocode/__version__.py\") as fp:\n      exec(fp.read(), version)\n  ```\n  could be replaced with:\n  ```python\n  import os\n  version_file = \"ourocode/__version__.py\"\n  version_namespace = {}\n  with open(version_file) as f:\n      code = compile(f.read(), version_file, 'exec')\n      exec(code, version_namespace)\n  version = version_namespace['__version__']\n  ```\n  or, better, import the version module directly:\n  ```python\n  from ourocode.__version__ import __version__\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `exec()`)",
