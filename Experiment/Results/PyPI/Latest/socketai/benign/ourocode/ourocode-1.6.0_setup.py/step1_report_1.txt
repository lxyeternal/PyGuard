  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ourocode' Python package, configuring package metadata and data files.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__.py file for version info; reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file during setup; reading README.md content for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version file, which could execute arbitrary code if the version file is maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks. The only potentially risky part is executing the contents of 'ourocode/__version__.py' via exec(). This could be exploited if the version file is compromised to contain malicious code. The rest of the script is standard setup configuration, with no other suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself appears to be a typical setup script with a single potentially risky point of executing external code via exec(). If the version file is trusted and secured, the risk is minimal. No malicious intent or malware is evident beyond this point.",
