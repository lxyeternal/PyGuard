{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'ourocode' Python package, primarily loading version info and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__.py' via open() and exec(); reading README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from version file; no other data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes code from version file; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which can execute arbitrary code if the version file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a known pattern of loading version info via exec(), which poses a security risk if the version file is maliciously altered. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of exec() is standard but should be replaced with safer alternatives. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis, considering the controlled environment assumption.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with a minor security concern regarding exec(). No malware or malicious behavior detected. The main recommendation is to replace exec() with a safer method to load version info, such as importing the version module directly or reading the version string without execution.",
