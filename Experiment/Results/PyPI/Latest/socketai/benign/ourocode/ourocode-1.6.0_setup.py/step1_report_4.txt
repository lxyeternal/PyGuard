  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ourocode' Python package, configuring package metadata and data files.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__.py file to obtain version info; reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from reading version info and README content during setup, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version info from a file; while exec() can be risky, in this context it's limited to reading a predefined version file, not user input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads version information via exec() from a local file and reads README.md for package description. No external data input, network operations, or potentially malicious code are present. The exec() usage is common in setup scripts to load version info but should be used cautiously; here, it appears to load a static version file. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The use of exec() for version loading is standard practice in setup scripts and does not pose a security threat in this context.",
