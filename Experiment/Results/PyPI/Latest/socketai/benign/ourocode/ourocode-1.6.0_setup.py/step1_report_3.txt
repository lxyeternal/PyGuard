  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ourocode' Python package, including version extraction and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'ourocode/__version__.py' and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious actions; no external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Version information is loaded from a local file; long description is read from a local markdown file. No flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' to read the version file poses a security concern, as 'exec' can execute arbitrary code if the version file is maliciously modified. Otherwise, the code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup operations. The key point is the use of 'exec' to read the version, which could potentially execute malicious code if the version file is compromised. No other suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The rest of the code is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is mostly benign, with the notable exception of using 'exec' to parse the version file, which could be a security risk if the file is tampered with. No malicious intent or malware is detected beyond this concern.",
