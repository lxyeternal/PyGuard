{
  "purpose": "This code defines a 'Neige' class for calculating snow loads on structures based on Eurocode standards, utilizing regional data from a CSV file and environmental parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads regional snow zone data from 'carte_action_region.csv' via pandas; accesses class attributes such as location code, altitude, roof angles.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal calculations and decorators for display; no external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV and class properties into calculation methods for snow load parameters (Sn, Sx, Se, fs). No external or untrusted data sources influence control flow or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Decorators ('handcalc') are solely for formatting/reporting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a domain-specific implementation for structural snow load calculations, performing physics-based computations with static data and parameters. It employs standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or security vulnerabilities. The extensive use of decorators is for visualization, not malicious intent. External data is static and assumed to be trustworthy; no user input is processed in a way that could lead to injection or code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent, and domain-appropriate implementation for calculating snow loads. It poses no security or supply chain risks based on the current analysis.",
