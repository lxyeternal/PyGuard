{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Neige' for calculating snow loads on structures based on Eurocode standards, including methods for loading data, computing snow load parameters, and performing related calculations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from a CSV file 'carte_action_region.csv' using pandas, and various class attributes are set or computed internally. No external inputs are directly processed in real-time or from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations, primarily on hardcoded parameters or class attributes. No direct data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV file reading into pandas DataFrame, through class properties and methods for calculations, with no external or untrusted data inputs leading to critical sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Use of 'handcalc' decorators suggests integration with a Jupyter notebook for display purposes, which is benign. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present. All external data sources are static files, and no code injection points are identified.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a structured, domain-specific implementation for calculating snow loads based on established standards. It reads data from a CSV file, performs calculations, and uses decorators for display, which is typical for scientific computations. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden functionalities. The code operates on well-defined parameters and internally controlled data. All external dependencies are standard libraries or well-known packages, with no suspicious code patterns. No signs of obfuscation or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific calculation module with no malicious behavior or supply chain security risks detected. It mainly performs calculations based on provided parameters and static data files, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
