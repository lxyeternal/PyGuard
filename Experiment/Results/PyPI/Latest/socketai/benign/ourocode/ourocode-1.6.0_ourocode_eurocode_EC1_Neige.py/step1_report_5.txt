{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for calculating snow load effects on buildings according to Eurocode standards, including methods for snow load calculation based on location, building roof type, and altitude.",
  "sources": "CSV file 'carte_action_region.csv' for regional snow zones, class properties and methods for building parameters, user input via constructor arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks indicating data leakage or system modification; computations involve standard mathematical operations and property access.",
  "flows": "Input data from CSV and class attributes flow through property methods to compute snow loads and related parameters, with no evident data exfiltration or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code via @handcalc decorators; the code imports external libraries, but no suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are evident; no backdoors or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class 'Neige' inheriting from 'Batiment' to compute snow loads based on various parameters, with computations based on regional data, roof type, altitude, and other factors. The code utilizes external CSV data, property decorators, and the 'handcalc' decorator for presentation or calculation display, but all functions are for physics-based calculations. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification code segments are present. The code's behavior appears consistent with a specialized engineering calculator, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate engineering computation module for snow load analysis, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It reads regional data, performs standard physics calculations, and has no indications of malicious data exfiltration or system compromise.",
