{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing, possibly involving input handling and output generation.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from stdin, file reads, environment variables), user prompts, or data parsing methods.",
  "sinks": "Output functions (e.g., printing, writing to files or network sockets), especially if they handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially passing through transformations before reaching output sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data, processes it through defined functions, and outputs results. It uses standard library functions without any suspicious patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious intent are evident. The structure and formatting are typical for a Python data processing script. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and consistent with normal data processing scripts.",
