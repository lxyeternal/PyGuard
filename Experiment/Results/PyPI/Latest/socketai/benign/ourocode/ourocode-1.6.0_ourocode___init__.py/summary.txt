  "conclusion": "Most reports are correctly scored as benign with low risk. Report 3 exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a slightly higher malware score (from 0.3 to 0.5). The current scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence provided. No further changes are necessary."
