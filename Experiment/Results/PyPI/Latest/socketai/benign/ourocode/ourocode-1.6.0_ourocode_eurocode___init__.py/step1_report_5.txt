  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to performing a specific operation or function, but without the actual code, the intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, or external libraries, though specifics are not provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing system commands, but without concrete code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be explicitly identified without the code; generally involves untrusted input reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detectable without the actual code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Based on the provided prompt, no malicious patterns or security risks are evident. The review lacks specific code elements to evaluate, leading to low confidence in identifying issues.",
  "conclusion": "Without the code, no definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The review remains inconclusive, and no suspicious activity is observed based on the current information.",
