{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but the exact intent is unclear due to lack of context and potential obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly network connections or file I/O, depending on the functions invoked.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, executing dynamic code, making network requests, or accessing sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like system commands, network calls, or file writes, potentially via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual features include dynamic execution (e.g., eval, exec), obfuscated variable names, or excessive use of imported modules without clear purpose. Hardcoded secrets or URLs are also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code must be reviewed thoroughly, focusing on any use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, network communications, or access to sensitive data. The presence of obfuscation or complex control flows increases suspicion. Without concrete code, the assessment relies on typical malicious patterns, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration points, or unauthorized system access methods.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available analysis framework, no explicit malicious behavior is definitively identified without further code details. However, the presence of obfuscation or suspicious imports warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate pending detailed inspection.",
