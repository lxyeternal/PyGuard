  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package potentially intended for general utility or library functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from imported modules or functions; no external input sources like user input, network, or files are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically; however, specific sinks are not visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "Unclear due to incomplete code; no explicit source-to-sink data flow can be established from the fragment provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident in the visible code. The code appears straightforward and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and does not demonstrate complex logic or unusual behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security-sensitive operations such as insecure data handling or network transmission. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malware indicators. Confidence is high that this code is safe within the limited context.",
