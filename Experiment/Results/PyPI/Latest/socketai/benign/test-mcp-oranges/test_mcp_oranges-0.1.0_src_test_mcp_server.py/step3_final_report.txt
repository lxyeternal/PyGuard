{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup for a FastMCP server with a simple greeting tool, likely for testing or demonstration.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static string used in instantiation and function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Static data from instantiation to tool function; no external data flow or untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'DummyTestMCP' suggests a non-production, test environment; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class, creating an instance with a test name, defining a simple tool returning 'Hello World!', and running the server. No external input, no malicious constructs, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The minimal setup indicates a benign testing or demonstration script. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be justified as minimal, but given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 is more accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal example with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for an accurate reflection of its benign status.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
