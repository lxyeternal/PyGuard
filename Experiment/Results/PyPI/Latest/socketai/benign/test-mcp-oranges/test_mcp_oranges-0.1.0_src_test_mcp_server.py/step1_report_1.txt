{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a FastMCP object from the mcp.server.fastmcp module, defining a simple 'hello_world' tool function that returns a greeting string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; all data is hardcoded or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data or external communication; the code only returns a static string.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the mcp object initializes, defines a tool, and then runs, with no external data flow or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a minimal, standard implementation without suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a class from a module, creates an instance with a static string parameter, defines a simple function decorated as a tool, and runs the MCP server. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or other suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, minimal setup for a FastMCP server with a simple greeting tool. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
