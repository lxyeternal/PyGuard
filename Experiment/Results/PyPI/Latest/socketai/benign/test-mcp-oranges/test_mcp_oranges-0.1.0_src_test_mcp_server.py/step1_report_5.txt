{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a FastMCP object and registers a simple tool that returns 'Hello World!'. It appears to be a minimal example for a plugin or extension framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it only defines a function and runs the framework. The only data input is the string 'DummyTestMCP' used to instantiate the object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data, send network requests, or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the function is a static greeting with no external dependencies or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module, initializes an object with a test parameter, registers a simple greeting function, and runs the framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The minimal nature of the code indicates it is a benign sample or boilerplate setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a basic setup for a tool framework with a simple function. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected.",
