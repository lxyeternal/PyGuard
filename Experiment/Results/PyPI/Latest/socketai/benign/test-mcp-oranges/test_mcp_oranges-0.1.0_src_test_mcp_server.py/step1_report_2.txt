{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a FastMCP object and defines a simple tool that returns 'Hello World!', then runs the MCP server.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing FastMCP from mcp.server.fastmcp; the string 'DummyTestMCP' used in object initialization.",
  "sinks": "The mcp.run() method call which starts the server, potentially exposing endpoints.",
  "flows": "Import of FastMCP -> Initialization with 'DummyTestMCP' -> Definition of hello_world() function -> Execution of mcp.run() which starts server and exposes the tool.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a placeholder or test name 'DummyTestMCP' suggests testing or non-production code; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, initializes it with a test name, defines a simple function annotated as a tool, and runs the server. The function itself is benign, returning a static string. The server start command is standard for such frameworks. No external data input, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The usage appears consistent with a test or example setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example or test setup for a FastMCP server with a simple tool. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are evident. The use of 'DummyTestMCP' suggests a non-production context.",
