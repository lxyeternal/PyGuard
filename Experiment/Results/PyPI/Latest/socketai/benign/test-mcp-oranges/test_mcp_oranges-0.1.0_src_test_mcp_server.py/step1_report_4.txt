{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple FastMCP server with a 'hello_world' tool for returning a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class 'FastMCP' from the 'mcp.server.fastmcp' module and initializes an instance with a string parameter. No external input sources are explicitly used within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of untrusted data. The only operation is returning a static string.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the 'hello_world' function returns a static string, and 'mcp.run()' executes the server loop without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard patterns for defining a tool with FastMCP and includes no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'FastMCP' and creates an instance named 'mcp'. It defines a tool 'hello_world' that returns a static greeting message. The server is started with 'mcp.run()'. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no potential security risks or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a minimal, benign setup for a FastMCP server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign example of setting up a FastMCP server with a simple tool. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
