{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an instance of FastMCP and defines a simple tool that returns a greeting message, then runs the MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a class from a third-party module and defines a function that returns a static string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only returns a hardcoded string.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import and function usage are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a class from an external module and instantiates it with a static string. It decorates a function with mcp.tool(), which registers it as a tool for the MCP server. The function simply returns a greeting. The main block executes mcp.run(). There is no evidence of malicious code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple example or a placeholder server setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a FastMCP server with a single greeting tool. No malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks are evident.",
