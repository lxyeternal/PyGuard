  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured bioinformatics utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minor security risk score reflects traceback exposure, which is typical in debugging contexts but can be mitigated by secure log handling. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
