      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics workflow with no malicious activity detected. The primary security risk stems from subprocess calls with shell=True, which could be exploited if inputs are unvalidated. Scores are set accordingly: malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.3 due to subprocess usage. Addressing subprocess security by avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs would mitigate this risk, but current evidence does not indicate malicious intent."

The minor security risk score reflects traceback exposure, which is typical in debugging contexts but can be mitigated by secure log handling. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
