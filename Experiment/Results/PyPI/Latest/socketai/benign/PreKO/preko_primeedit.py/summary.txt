  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics workflow with no malicious activity detected. The primary security risk stems from subprocess calls with shell=True, which could be exploited if inputs are unvalidated. Scores are set accordingly: malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.3 due to subprocess usage. Addressing subprocess security by avoiding shell=True or sanitizing inputs would mitigate this risk, but current evidence does not indicate malicious intent."
