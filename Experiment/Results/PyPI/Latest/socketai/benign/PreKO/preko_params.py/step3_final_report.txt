  "purpose": "Configuration classes for bioinformatics pipeline parameters, including alignment options, indel search settings, and parallel execution configuration.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, default values, and type annotations within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed; the code solely defines static configuration data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic execution; static class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in attribute name 'save_classfied_FASTQ' (likely intended as 'save_classified_FASTQ').",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Pydantic model classes with default values. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor issue is a typographical error in an attribute name, which could cause runtime issues but does not impact security. The reports provided are empty, containing only 'Empty response' messages, offering no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation. Therefore, the code appears benign, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration data with a minor typo. No malicious or security issues are evident. The supply chain appears secure, and the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all be zero.",
