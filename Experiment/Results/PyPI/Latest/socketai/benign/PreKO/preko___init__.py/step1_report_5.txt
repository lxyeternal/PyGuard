  "purpose": "Define the package version and include import statement for a specific module from the 'preko.indel' package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from preko.indel import InDelSearcher' reads data from the 'preko.indel' package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks are present; the code only imports a class and defines a version string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module into the code context but is not used further; no malicious data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors. The import is straightforward, and version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a package, which is standard practice. The version string is hardcoded. Comments relate to versioning and publishing commands but do not execute any code. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets a version and imports a class, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
