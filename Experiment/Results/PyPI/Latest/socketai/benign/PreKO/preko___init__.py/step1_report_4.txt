  "purpose": "Import a class from the 'preko.indel' module, likely for genetic data analysis or similar purposes.",
  "sources": "The only source of data appears to be the import statement, which imports the 'InDelSearcher' class. There are no input or data reading operations in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, network communication, or file writing observed in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a class and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The commented lines pertain to package versioning and publishing commands, which are standard; no suspicious or unusual code is present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module and defines a version string. The comments suggest instructions for version bumping and publishing, but these are standard and do not execute any harmful actions. No input handling, data processing, or output functions are present. Overall, the code appears to be a typical package setup or module import with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, involving an import statement and version definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a package setup or module definition.",
