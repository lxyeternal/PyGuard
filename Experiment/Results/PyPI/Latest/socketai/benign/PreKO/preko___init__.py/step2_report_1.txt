  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom preko.indel import InDelSearcher\n\n__version__ = '0.1.0'\n```\n\n**Overall Context:**\n- The code imports a class from an external package (`preko.indel`) and sets a static version string.\n- The comments are standard instructions for versioning and publishing.\n- There are no runtime data flows, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be part of a package setup or module definition.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward version assignment, import from a trusted package.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues. The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, benign import and version string, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 (due to comments), Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the code's simplicity. The comments are standard and do not introduce risk. I would suggest lowering this to 0, as no actual risk is present.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same benign pattern, standard import, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Same benign pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same benign import and version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.9 (confidence 0.9)\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence in the benign nature is appropriate; the risk score should be 0, not 0.9. The \"malware\" score is 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only point of contention is the risk score in some reports, which is assigned as 0.1 or 0.9 despite the code being harmless.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Risk scores:** Should be 0 across all reports, given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correct at 0.\n- **Malware scores:** Correct at 0.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is a standard package module snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores are mostly accurate, but the risk scores should be uniformly lowered to 0 for consistency and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context; if this code were part of a larger package, the import might warrant further review, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
