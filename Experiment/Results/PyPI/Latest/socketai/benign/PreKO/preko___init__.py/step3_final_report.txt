  "purpose": "Minimal package module with import and version string, intended for distribution or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'preko.indel' package, static version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are used or generated.",
  "flows": "Import from external package (trusted or untrusted), static version assignment; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration, comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external package and sets a static version string. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The import could be a vector if the package is malicious, but in this static context, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. Comments are standard and do not introduce risk. The scores across reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. Confidence scores are high, reflecting the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package module snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action is necessary.",
