  "purpose": "The code defines a module version and includes commented instructions for versioning, building, and publishing a Python package.",
  "sources": "The only active source of input is the assignment of __version__ to '0.1.0'. The comments may contain user instructions but do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could cause a data leak or effect, as no runtime data handling, network operations, or sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. Comments are standard instructions for versioning and publishing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module, which might be part of a larger package, but this snippet only includes the import statement and version declaration. The comments relate to package versioning and publishing commands. No runtime logic, data handling, or potentially malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and appears to be a standard setup or metadata snippet for a Python package. There are no indicators of malware or security issues.",
