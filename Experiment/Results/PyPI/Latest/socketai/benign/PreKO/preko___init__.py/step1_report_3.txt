{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class from a module and contains comments related to versioning and publishing a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'preko.indel' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statement is static and not user-controlled",
  "anomalies": "Comments related to versioning and publishing do not contain any secrets or malicious instructions. No suspicious code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a package, likely for use elsewhere. The comments are instructions for version bumping and publishing, which are standard in package development. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The import is from an open-source package, which is typical and not suspicious by itself. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign snippet for a Python package module with standard import and comments related to versioning and publishing. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident.",
