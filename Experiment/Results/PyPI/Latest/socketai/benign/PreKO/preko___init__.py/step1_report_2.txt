{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a Python package and imports a module from the 'preko.indel' package, likely for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'preko.indel' module import and the inline comments related to versioning and publishing commands.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The import statement could load external code, but without executing it or handling untrusted input, no malicious flow is evident. The version string is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out instructions related to package publishing, but no embedded malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are visible. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of an import statement from a trusted package and some commented instructions for version management and publishing. The version string is a static assignment. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. The import does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly establishing a version string and importing a module. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided snippet.",
