  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics utility with minimal security risks. The primary concern is the use of shell commands with untrusted inputs, which is mitigated by validation but should be handled carefully. Debugging artifacts should be removed in production. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low, and the supply chain integrity appears intact."
