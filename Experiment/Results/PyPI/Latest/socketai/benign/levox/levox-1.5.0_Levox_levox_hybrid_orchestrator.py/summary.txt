  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent GDPR compliance orchestrator with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting minimal concerns related to external modules and file handling. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
