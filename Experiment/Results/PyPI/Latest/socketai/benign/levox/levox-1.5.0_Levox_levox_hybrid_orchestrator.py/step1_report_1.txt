{
  "purpose": "This module orchestrates GDPR compliance scanning by coordinating rule-based and AI-based analysis on code files, consolidating issues, and facilitating remediation.",
  "sources": "Code reads file paths, reads files during scanning, and loads configuration settings (implied from self.config in some methods).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if issues or sensitive data are exported or logs contain sensitive info; no direct external network communication is present; issues are stored or saved locally.",
  "flows": "File paths are collected from target directories; files are scanned by rule-based and AI engines; issues are consolidated; remediation is applied based on the findings; results are saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a security or compliance tool, with no obvious malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior is present. The use of threading is typical for performance and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically performs GDPR compliance scanning with modular design. It loads files, applies rule-based and AI-based analysis, consolidates issues, and optionally remediates. No network communication, no code injection, and no suspicious data handling are detected. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules ('levox' packages), but their usage appears normal and purpose-driven. The code does not perform any operations that would harm the system, steal data, or establish backdoors. Overall, it functions as an orchestrator for compliance scanning without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate compliance orchestrator with no signs of malicious behavior. It coordinates file analysis and remediation workflows safely and transparently. No malware or security risks are identified.",
