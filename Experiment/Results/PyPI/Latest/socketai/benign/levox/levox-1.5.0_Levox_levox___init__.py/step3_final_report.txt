  "analysis": "The code is a simple comment and version variable with no executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as metadata or placeholder information. The minimal nature and lack of dynamic or external components indicate a benign purpose.",

The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No further action or concern is warranted.",
