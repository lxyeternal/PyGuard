  "purpose": "Command Line Interface for Levox GDPR Compliance Tool, enabling users to scan, fix, report, and validate GDPR compliance issues in code directories.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as os, sys, json, time, prompt_toolkit, and internal levox modules (scanner, fixer, report). User input via prompt_toolkit's PromptSession.",
  "sinks": "User input from prompt_toolkit prompt, file system operations (reading directories, writing reports), potential display of sensitive information via print statements, and external dependencies (levox modules).",
  "flows": "User inputs commands → commands parsed and validated → functions like scan_directory, fix_issues, generate_report, validate_fixes invoked → external modules (Scanner, Fixer) process data → reports generated and files written → outputs printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious external network connections or data exfiltration routines. The code mainly performs file I/O, user prompts, and report generation. No obfuscated code features or misuse of dynamic code execution. The use of advanced scanner with higher confidence filtering suggests careful analysis, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI interface facilitating GDPR compliance scans, fixes, and reports by interacting with internal levox modules. It employs standard Python and third-party libraries without unusual code constructs. The code avoids unsafe practices like direct system command execution, insecure handling of secrets, or data exfiltration. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The functions are structured to perform expected tasks with user confirmation prompts and progress animations. The code's only concern might be the potential risk inherent in the 'fix' procedures if misused, but that stems from functionality, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for GDPR compliance management with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs file and directory operations, user interactions, and report generation securely. No suspicious or harmful activities are detected.",
