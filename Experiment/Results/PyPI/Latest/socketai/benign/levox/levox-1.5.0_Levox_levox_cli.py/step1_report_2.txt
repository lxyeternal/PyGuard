  "purpose": "Command-line interface for GDPR compliance analysis, fixing, and reporting in codebases using levox modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard modules (os, sys, json, time, pathlib, typing), third-party modules (prompt_toolkit), and levox internal modules (scanner, fixer, report). User input via prompt_toolkit and file system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Reading user input, reading directory paths, displaying output, reading and modifying files during fix operations, generating reports, and external calls via levox modules. No direct network, system, or environment variable exploitation detected.",
  "flows": "User input -> command parsing -> directory scanning -> issue filtering -> display -> optional fixing with progress animations -> report generation. Data flow from filesystem and user input to outputs and levox modules for fixing and reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard libraries and well-structured code. External module 'levox' functions are imported but not detailed; their security depends on implementation, but calls are standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard command-line interface managing GDPR compliance tasks, with careful input parsing and delegation to levox modules for core functions. It performs directory scanning, issue filtering based on confidence and severity, issue display with detailed grouping, and fixing procedures that include progress animations and user confirmation. External dependencies are primarily user interaction and file operations, with no signs of malicious network activity or data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscated logic, backdoors, or malicious system calls. It relies on trusted modules for core security functions, and no insecure practices such as eval, exec, or insecure network communication are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate GDPR compliance CLI tool with no evident malicious intent. It carefully manages user data and interacts with external modules via controlled APIs. No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code; the security of the levox modules themselves depends on their implementation, but within this script, no malicious behavior is evident.",
