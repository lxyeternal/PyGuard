  "purpose": "A GDPR compliance scanner using Semgrep patterns to identify potential GDPR issues in code.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from user data, files, environment variables, and external APIs; patterns in code trigger potential issues.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks include API calls, data transfer functions, cookie and storage setters, and database queries.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input, data collection, or environment variables flow into API calls, data transfers, storage, and database queries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. The code primarily contains pattern matching rules and fallback mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines GDPR rules as patterns and uses Semgrep to scan code for compliance issues, with a fallback to a basic scanner if Semgrep fails. The rules target PII collection, data transfer, consent, security, and data minimization, aiming to identify common GDPR violations. The scanning process creates a temporary YAML configuration for Semgrep, runs it, and processes results into GDPRIssue objects. The remediation suggestions are detailed and context-aware, providing guidance based on detected issues. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's purpose is transparent and security-focused. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate GDPR compliance tool that leverages pattern matching for security and privacy audits. It does not contain malicious code or behavior. It functions as intended to identify potential GDPR violations, with fallback mechanisms to ensure robustness. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
