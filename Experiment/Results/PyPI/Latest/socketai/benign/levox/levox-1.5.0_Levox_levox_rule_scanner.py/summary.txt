  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured GDPR compliance scanner with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The risk score is appropriately low, reflecting minimal security concerns primarily related to external command execution. No modifications are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis."
