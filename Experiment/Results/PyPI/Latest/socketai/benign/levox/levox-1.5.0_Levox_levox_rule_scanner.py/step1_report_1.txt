{
  "purpose": "A GDPR compliance scanner that uses Semgrep patterns and fallback static analysis to identify potential GDPR-related issues in code.",
  "sources": "Code sections where patterns match: data collection (e.g., email, personal data), data transfer (API calls, third-party services), consent handling (cookie, storage), security measures (plaintext passwords, insecure protocols), data minimization (select all, find queries).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or unsafe operations: storing sensitive data in plaintext, insecure data transfer protocols, setting cookies/storage without consent, unrestricted database queries, exporting or transferring data improperly, API calls to external services.",
  "flows": "Sources such as pattern matches for PII, API calls, cookie/storage settings, and insecure protocols flow into remediation recommendations or potential security issues, depending on whether proper safeguards are in place. For example, pattern detections of PII collection or data transfer may lead to security measures or legal compliance warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily contains pattern-based rules and remediation snippets. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms. The snippets include detailed GDPR guidance and security advice, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a rule-based GDPR compliance scanner leveraging Semgrep patterns, which can detect data collection, transfer, consent issues, and security risks. It dynamically generates rules, writes them to a temporary YAML file, and runs Semgrep via subprocess, parsing JSON output to create GDPRIssue objects. The fallback scanner handles errors or absence of findings. The remediation suggestions are detailed and context-specific, aimed at improving GDPR compliance. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present. The patterns and snippets are consistent with compliance guidance, and there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a GDPR compliance static analysis tool with pattern matching and fallback mechanisms. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious code patterns. Its primary purpose is regulatory compliance and security enhancement, not malicious activity. Therefore, the overall risk of malware or malicious intent is very low.",
