  "conclusion": "The script is a benign GDPR remediation tool relying on external AI responses. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main security risk stems from unvalidated AI-generated code, which could be malicious if the AI is compromised. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk scores are appropriate and justified."
