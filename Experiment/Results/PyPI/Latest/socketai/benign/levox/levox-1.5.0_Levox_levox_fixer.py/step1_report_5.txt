  "purpose": "The code aims to identify GDPR compliance issues in Python code and generate fixes using the Ollama LLM, then apply these fixes to the source files.",
  "sources": "Reads source code files for context; uses 'ollama' library for model interaction; reads and writes to files when applying fixes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes fixes back into source code files; reads source code for context; outputs generated code fixes.",
  "flows": "Extracts code context from files (source); generates fixes via Ollama API; applies fixes to source files (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code dynamically calls an external LLM API, which could be misused if compromised, but this is a legitimate external dependency. No suspicious network activity or data leakage evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation for code review and remediation based on GDPR compliance issues. It conditionally imports and interacts with an external LLM API (Ollama) for generating fixes. It retrieves code context from files, constructs prompts, calls the API, processes responses, and writes fixes back into files. No embedded malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. The use of the Ollama API appears legitimate and controlled. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is reliance on external API calls, but this is part of its intended design.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware. It is a legitimate code remediation tool using an external LLM API. No malicious signals or sabotage are detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
