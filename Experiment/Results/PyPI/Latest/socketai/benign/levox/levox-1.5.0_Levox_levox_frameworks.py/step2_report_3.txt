  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static analysis utility with regex patterns for various frameworks and cloud providers. It detects framework usage via import statements and pattern matching, with no execution or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly detection of insecure configs)\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Patterns are straightforward and serve detection purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for static detection, minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing pattern matching for frameworks and security issues, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads or suspicious code; patterns are detection-oriented.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, static analysis utility.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern detection focus, with detection of insecure configurations like `DEBUG=True` and hardcoded secrets, but no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Patterns target security misconfigurations, not malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, detection of insecure configs, but no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar detection utility, with patterns for security and privacy concerns, no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still related to security concerns)\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just pattern matching.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, detection for privacy/security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, designed for framework and security issue detection, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate security analysis utility.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—it's pattern matching for detection, not executing or injecting malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code's straightforward regex patterns.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting detection of security misconfigurations and sensitive data handling, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a static pattern matching utility for security and privacy detection across multiple frameworks and cloud providers.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The regex patterns are broad but serve detection purposes; no code execution or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- The pattern definitions include some security misconfigurations (e.g., `DEBUG=True`, hardcoded secrets), which are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (low, primarily due to detection of insecure configs, which are security issues but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate static analysis utility designed for security and privacy pattern detection. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects security concerns about insecure configurations, not malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is, with perhaps a slight emphasis on the security concern aspect rather than risk of malware.",
