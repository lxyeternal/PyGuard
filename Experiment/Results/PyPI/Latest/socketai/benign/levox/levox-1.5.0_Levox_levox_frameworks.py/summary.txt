  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static pattern matching utility aimed at detecting framework usage and security issues. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (0.1-0.2) are justified. The existing reports accurately reflect the code's purpose and security posture. No modifications are necessary."
