  "purpose": "The code defines detection patterns and functions to identify the usage of various web frameworks, cloud services, and security-related issues within source code files. Its primary purpose is to facilitate static analysis for security and privacy concerns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the 'file_content' string parameter in functions 'detect_frameworks' and 'get_framework_patterns'. It also checks for specific patterns in the content to identify framework usage and security issues.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process untrusted data for harmful actions. It only matches patterns in input files to identify potential security issues without executing or directly interacting with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves analyzing the 'file_content' to detect frameworks and corresponding patterns. Detected patterns can be used downstream for security assessments; however, the code itself does not perform data flow or exploit actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of pattern definitions and detection functions; it does not include any suspicious or malicious code snippets such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no hardcoded credentials or secret keys. The only potential concern is the use of regex patterns that could be used to identify sensitive code segments, but this is benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a static analysis tool, defining regex patterns to identify framework-specific code snippets and security issues in source files. It includes multiple pattern dictionaries for various frameworks and cloud providers, and functions to detect frameworks and compile relevant patterns for further scanning. The patterns are straightforward and intended for pattern matching; there is no execution or code manipulation. The code is well-structured for detection purposes and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic. No obfuscation or hidden code is present. Overall, the script appears purely as a security-oriented pattern matcher with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a static detection utility for various frameworks and security issues within source code files. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code. The patterns and functions are used for security assessments, and there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The risk is minimal, and the code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
