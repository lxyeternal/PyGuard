  "purpose": "Static pattern matching for framework detection and security issue identification in source code files.",
  "sources": "Import statements, regex pattern matches within code content, framework-specific import and usage patterns.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching functions that analyze code content for specific regex patterns indicating framework usage, security misconfigurations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Detection functions scan code for framework indicators (sources), then match patterns (sinks) to identify security issues or framework usage, with no dynamic or malicious code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; patterns are straightforward regexes; code is static and detection-oriented. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static analysis utility with regex patterns for multiple frameworks and cloud providers, designed to detect framework usage, security misconfigurations, and PII handling. It extends patterns with cross-framework categories related to privacy and security concerns. The detection functions rely on simple substring checks and regex matching, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The patterns are broad but serve detection purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The scores assigned in existing reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, detection-focused nature of the code, primarily flagging security misconfigurations rather than active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static pattern matching utility aimed at detecting framework usage and security issues. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (0.1-0.2) are justified. The existing reports accurately reflect the code's purpose and security posture. No modifications are necessary.",
