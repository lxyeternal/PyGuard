{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'levox' project, performing typical operations such as reading requirements, long description, and configuring setup() with metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md', modifying sys.path, and static configuration data in setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted input or execute code dynamically",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It reads static files, modifies sys.path for local module inclusion, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. All signals indicate benign intent, with no suspicious patterns or external network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
