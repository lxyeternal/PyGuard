{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'levox' Python package, including reading dependencies, long description, and defining entry points and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'Levox/requirements.txt', reading 'README.md' for long description, and importing standard modules such as 'setuptools', 'os', and 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits untrusted data, nor does it execute external code beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the use of sys.path modification and file reads are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies sys.path to include the 'Levox' directory, reads dependencies and README content, and configures setup() with package info, requirements, entry points, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code operates solely within the setup context and uses safe, standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. It reads files and configures package metadata without executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
