{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'levox' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'Levox/requirements.txt', reading long description from 'README.md', obtaining package info from 'os.path' and 'sys' modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; all file operations and package setup parameters are static or based on predefined files.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for dependencies and descriptions, then passes data into setup() without executing or injecting code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated behavior are present. Use of sys.path modification is standard in setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: it modifies sys.path to ensure package discovery, reads requirements and README files, and invokes setup() with package metadata and configuration. All operations are typical for Python package distribution scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The script does not execute untrusted data; it only reads local files and passes their contents to the setup() function. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and adheres to typical practices for Python package distribution. No security risks are present.",
