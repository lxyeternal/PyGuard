{
  "purpose": "The code is a GDPR and PII compliance scanner employing regex patterns, context rules, static code analysis, and filtering to detect privacy-related issues without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching in code lines, context analysis around suspicious lines, static analysis of code imports and structure, comments, and filename heuristics.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data collection points, data transfer functions, consent and privacy-related code comments, external API calls, and data deletion functions.",
  "flows": "Source patterns detected in code lines trigger context analysis; context and static analysis inform confidence; issues are flagged if confidence exceeds thresholds, with potential false positives filtered out.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no network exfiltration or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs layered detection strategies, including regex pattern matching for GDPR/PII signals, context rules to reduce false positives, static code analysis via AST parsing for privacy-related identifiers, and filename/content heuristics. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The confidence scores are high, reflecting thorough analysis. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is low (0.1-0.2), consistent with a compliance tool designed for privacy monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GDPR/PII compliance scanner with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
