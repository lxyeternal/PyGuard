{
  "purpose": "Provides an AI-powered analysis tool for GDPR compliance scanning of Python files, using language models to identify potential privacy and data protection issues.",
  "sources": "Imports os, re, logging, json, ast, time; accesses environment variables for API keys; reads Python files from disk.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external AI APIs (OpenAI, Ollama), potentially sending code or data over the network; writes to cache files; reads files from disk.",
  "flows": "File content is read and analyzed; context is prepared and sent to AI API; AI response is parsed; issues are generated and cached.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected; code patterns are consistent with a compliance analysis tool. Patterns for GDPR-related content are comprehensive but standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors found. The AI API keys are retrieved from environment variables, which is standard practice, not malicious. The code uses regex and AST for static analysis, nothing unusual or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate and well-structured GDPR compliance analysis tool, leveraging AI models to identify privacy issues. It cautiously handles API keys via environment variables, caches responses securely, and parses Python code accurately. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only network interactions are to AI providers, which are expected and documented. No suspicious code injection, data theft, or harmful activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate GDPR compliance scanner employing AI services. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It follows best practices for security and data handling, with no signs of sabotage or harmful intent.",
