  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose and sources align with the code's intent.\n- No suspicious sinks or flows; AI calls are standard.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or malicious indicators; fallback import strategies are benign.\n- Logic: The analysis concludes no malware or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, which is consistent.\n- Confidence: 0.9, justified given the thorough reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose; sources and flows match.\n- Anomalies: Use of environment variables and unencrypted cache are noted but are standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious activity; AI API calls are expected.\n- Malware score: 0, consistent.\n- Confidence: 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected; reasoning is solid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose and flow match expectations.\n- Anomalies: No backdoors or malicious code; AI communication is standard.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; reasoning aligns with code behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose and sources consistent.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity; AI API usage is standard.\n- Malware score: 0, fitting.\n- Confidence: 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis; sources and flow align.\n- Anomalies: No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0, correct.\n- Confidence: 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate GDPR compliance analysis tool.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- The malware scores across all reports are correctly set to 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate given the detailed reasoning.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard minimal risk for external API calls, but no actual threat)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a legitimate GDPR compliance tool with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
