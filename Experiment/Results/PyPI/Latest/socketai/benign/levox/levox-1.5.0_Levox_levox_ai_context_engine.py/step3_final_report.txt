  "purpose": "This code implements an AI-powered GDPR compliance analysis tool that scans Python files for potential privacy issues, including pattern matching for sensitive data and AI-based contextual analysis.",
  "sources": "File reading operations, pattern matching for PII and sensitive operations, environment variables for API keys, AST parsing for code structure, AI API calls for analysis.",
  "sinks": "AI response handling, JSON parsing, cache storage, pattern matching results, potential external API interactions.",
  "flows": "File content is read and analyzed; pattern matching identifies sensitive data; context is prepared; AI is invoked with prompt; response is parsed into issues; issues are stored in cache.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Use of environment variables for API keys and plain JSON cache storage are standard practices, though unencrypted cache could be a minor security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file analysis using pattern matching and AST parsing to identify potential GDPR issues, then leverages AI APIs to provide contextual analysis. It caches responses for efficiency. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The pattern matching is comprehensive for GDPR-relevant data, and the AI prompt is structured to produce structured JSON output. The cache is stored unencrypted, which could be a security concern but not malicious. The overall design aligns with legitimate security analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate GDPR compliance analysis tool leveraging AI, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the functionality and security considerations.",
