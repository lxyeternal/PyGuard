  "purpose": "Functions that send user input and parameters to external servers via HTTP GET requests, acting as API proxies.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (`text`, `key`, `model`) directly embedded into URL query strings without sanitization.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET requests to hardcoded IP addresses with user data in URL parameters; response parsing from JSON.",
  "flows": "User input flows from function parameters into URL query strings, sent over HTTP, with responses parsed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded IP addresses, custom 'Host' headers with UUID-like values, lack of input validation, and use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions that relay user input to external servers via GET requests, with minimal validation and hardcoded endpoints. No malicious code, obfuscation, or system modifications are present. The primary concern is insecure network communication and potential data leakage. Malware activity is not detected; the code functions as an API proxy. The use of HTTP and hardcoded IPs increases security risk, but no active malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but presents moderate security risks due to insecure practices and reliance on external endpoints. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.4, reflecting the potential for data exposure and insecure transmission.",
