{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the setup process for a Python package named 'spider-ai' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, and the packages to include.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior; the code appears to be standard package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata values, including package name, version, author, description (in Arabic), classifiers, and required Python version. There are no dynamic code executions, external data fetches, or potentially malicious code constructs. The description contains Arabic text, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The setup script conforms to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
