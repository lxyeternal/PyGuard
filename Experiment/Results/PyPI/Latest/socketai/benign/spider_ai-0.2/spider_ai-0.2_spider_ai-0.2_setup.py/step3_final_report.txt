  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, description, classifiers, python_requires; no external or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Arabic description text is unusual but benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs. The Arabic description does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is safe, standard, and poses no security risks. The Arabic description does not impact security. All reports are accurate and require no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
