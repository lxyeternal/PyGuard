{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'spider-ai' with metadata including author, version, description, and package discovery instructions.",
  "sources": "Imports the setuptools module; calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Description contains Arabic text but no suspicious or malicious content; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, which is standard for Python package setup scripts. The setup() function is called with typical package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. The description includes Arabic text describing the library, but this does not indicate malicious intent. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or suspicious code structures present. The script appears to be a straightforward package configuration script with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It poses no security risks.",
