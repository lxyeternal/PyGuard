  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'spider-ai' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and finds packages to include.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script specifying package metadata and configuration. It uses 'setuptools.find_packages()' to locate packages, and specifies Python version compatibility. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
