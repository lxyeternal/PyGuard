{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project named 'spider-ai' with metadata including name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "Code reads package data from setuptools and package discovery functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply configures package setup without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. Description contains Arabic text, but it's benign and describes AI services.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools setup pattern for packaging Python modules. It defines package metadata and requirements with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions. The use of 'setuptools.find_packages()' is common for package discovery. The description field includes non-English text, which is benign in this context. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
