  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'shadowlang' Python package, configuring package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Open 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No obvious untrusted data sinks. No dynamic execution or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' to set long description; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager could lead to resource warnings, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and console script entry points. It reads the README.md file for long description without any apparent malicious code. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious logic present. No anomalies indicating malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package setup file with no malicious code or supply chain threats detected.",
