{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'shadowlang', including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading the README.md file into the long_description parameter, then passing all setup parameters to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard setup practices. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, author info, and entry points. The only file read is README.md, which is typical for package description. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external network connections, or obfuscated logic. It adheres to standard packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It solely manages package configuration.",
