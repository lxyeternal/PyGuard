  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'shadowlang' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input reading occurs in 'long_description=open(\"README.md\").read()'. No other user input or external data sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into 'long_description' field; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python 'setup.py' using setuptools for packaging. It reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, which is common practice. The entry point specifies a command-line script 'shadow' mapped to 'shadowlang.runner:main', which appears legitimate. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. There are no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited maliciously. The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and entry points.",
