{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'shadowlang' Python package, including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Read operation on 'README.md' file during long_description assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network, file writing, or execution of untrusted inputs present.",
  "flows": "File read source flows into long_description; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The setup script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The only file read occurs when opening 'README.md' for the long_description, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares a Python package with defined entry points and metadata.",
