  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager, but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools. It imports setup functions, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The only minor concern is the open() call without a context manager, which does not impact security. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications or warnings are necessary.",
