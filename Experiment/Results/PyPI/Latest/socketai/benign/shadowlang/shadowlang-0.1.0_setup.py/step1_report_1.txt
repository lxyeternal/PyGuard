  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'shadowlang', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file to set the long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading README.md into the long_description parameter in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools. It imports necessary functions, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, and reads the README.md file for the description. No code execution, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not include dynamic execution, network access, or other suspicious activities. The only potential concern is reading an external file, but this is standard in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup file.",
