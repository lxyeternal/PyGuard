  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for tokens used in a parser or lexer.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears benign, standard, and intended for syntactic processing.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code matches the description: straightforward class definitions with no runtime logic, data manipulation, or external interactions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores Given and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is needed; the code poses no security risk.\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and content.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of class definitions for tokens used in language parsing. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The analysis confirms the benign nature of this dependency segment.",
