{
  "purpose": "Define token classes for a lexer or parser, representing different token types used in language processing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points; the code only defines classes without executing or outputting data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class constructors are simple and do not handle external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of classes representing different token types for language parsing, with each class initializing with a value and calling the parent constructor. The classes are straightforward and only define data structures without executing any logic that could be malicious. No external input handling, network communication, or sensitive data processing is present. The code appears to be purely declarative for token representation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of class definitions for tokens, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. It is a benign utility module likely used in a language parser or interpreter.",
