{
  "purpose": "Define token classes for a lexical analysis or parser component in a programming language or interpreter.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions are static and do not read input or data.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code does not process external data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions without any suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple token classes inheriting from a base Token class, used for representing different token types such as integers, floats, operators, variables, etc. All classes initialize with a value parameter and assign a type string. The __repr__ method returns the token's value as a string. There are no input/output operations, no data parsing, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, and no security-sensitive operations. The structure and content are typical for language parsing components. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of token classes for a lexer or parser with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger language processing system, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
