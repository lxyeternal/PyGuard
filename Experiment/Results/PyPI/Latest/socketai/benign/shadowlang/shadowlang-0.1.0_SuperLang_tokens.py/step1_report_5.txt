{
  "purpose": "Define various token classes for a lexer or parser in a programming language or interpreter.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes without processing runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of class definitions representing different token types, likely for a compiler or interpreter. Each class inherits from a base Token class and initializes with a type and value. There are no input reading, external data processing, or output actions. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code is straightforward and purely definitional. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard token class definition for a language parser or lexer, with no malicious or security concerns identified. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger, benign system.",
