{
  "purpose": "Defines various token classes for a lexer or parser, representing different token types with associated values.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of token objects with specific values; no external data input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "Creation of token instances with specific values; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple token classes inheriting from a base Token class, each initializing with a value and setting a type string. The __repr__ method returns the token's value. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or network interactions. The code is purely structural for representing tokens in a language parser. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The analysis confirms the code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of token classes for a parser or lexer. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
