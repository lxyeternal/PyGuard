{
  "purpose": "Define token classes for a parser or compiler, representing different token types such as integers, floats, operators, variables, etc.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors, no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present, as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for token class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from a base Token class. Each class initializes with a specific token type and a value, used likely for lexical analysis or parsing in a language processor. No external inputs, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. There is no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard class definitions for token representation, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger language parsing system.",
