{
  "purpose": "Defines various token classes for a lexical analyzer or parser, representing different token types in source code.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as data output, network transmission, or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes inheriting from a base Token class, each representing a different token type with an initializer setting type and value attributes. There are no dynamic executions, data manipulations, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of token classes for a parser or lexer, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears benign and intended solely for syntactic processing.",
