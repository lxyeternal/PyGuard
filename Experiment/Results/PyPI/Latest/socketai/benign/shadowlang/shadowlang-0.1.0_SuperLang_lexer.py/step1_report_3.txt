  "purpose": "A lexical analyzer (lexer) for tokenizing a custom programming language or script.",
  "sources": "The input text provided to the Lexer class, specifically in the tokenize() method and extract_number(), extract_word() methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or files. The code primarily processes and stores tokens internally.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenize() method -> extract_number() / extract_word() -> tokens list",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic tokenization without any suspicious or malicious features. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No external system calls or network operations present. The use of class variables and tokenization logic appears standard. The code allows for flexible parsing of a language but doesn't contain malicious payloads or covert channels.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward lexer implementation for a custom language, parsing numbers, keywords, operators, and variables. It does not execute or evaluate code, nor does it contain network or system calls. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is conventional, with no suspicious control flow or obfuscation. The only potential concern is that if this lexer is used in a broader context, the tokens could be misused downstream, but within this snippet, there's no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard lexical analyzer without malicious features. It securely processes input text into tokens for further parsing. No malware or security risks are evident within this isolated code segment.",
