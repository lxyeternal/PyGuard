  "purpose": "Tokenizer for a custom programming language, converting source text into tokens for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the Lexer class for tokenization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling beyond tokenization.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenize() -> extract_number/extract_word -> tokens list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code only performs lexical analysis without executing or transmitting data.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward lexer for a custom language, converting input text into token objects. It processes characters sequentially, identifying numbers, words, and operators, and appends corresponding token objects to a list. No network activity, system manipulation, or data exfiltration appears in this module. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code relies solely on local processing of input data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard lexical analyzer without malicious intent. It performs input parsing into tokens for a language interpreter or compiler. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this module.",
