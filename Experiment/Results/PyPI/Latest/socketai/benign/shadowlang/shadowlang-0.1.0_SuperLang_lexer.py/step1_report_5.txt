{
  "purpose": "Tokenizes input text into language-specific tokens such as numbers, keywords, operators, and variables for a language parser or interpreter.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the Lexer class during instantiation (self.text).",
  "sinks": "Tokens generated and stored in self.tokens list; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Character extraction and classification -> Token creation -> Tokens appended to self.tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or data leaks identified. The code appears to perform standard lexical analysis without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical lexical analysis: reading input character-by-character, extracting numbers and words, classifying tokens, and appending tokens to a list. It uses predefined keywords, operators, and delimiters. The functions 'extract_number' and 'extract_word' process sequences of characters into tokens. No external calls, system modifications, or data leaks are present. No suspicious or malicious constructs, such as dynamic code execution or external resource access, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward lexer implementation for a custom language. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The design is standard for a lexical analyzer. Given the absence of suspicious features, the likelihood of malicious activity is very low.",
