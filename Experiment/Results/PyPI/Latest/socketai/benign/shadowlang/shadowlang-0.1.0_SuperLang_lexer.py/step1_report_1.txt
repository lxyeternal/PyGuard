{
  "purpose": "Tokenizes input text into language-specific tokens for further parsing and interpretation.",
  "sources": "Input text provided during Lexer instantiation (self.text).",
  "targets": "No external untrusted data is directly written or transmitted; tokens are generated from input text only.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Character processing -> Token creation -> Token list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of unsafe functions or external system calls. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a lexical analyzer (lexer) that processes input text to generate tokens based on predefined categories such as numbers, keywords, and operators. It correctly identifies number formats, keywords, variables, and operators. The tokenization process is straightforward and does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. No code injection, secret leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only concern could be potential misclassification if the input contains malicious code, but this is typical for a lexer and does not constitute malicious activity. The code appears clean, well-structured, and free from malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard lexer implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely performs tokenization based on predefined language syntax, with no external or hidden malicious activities detected.",
