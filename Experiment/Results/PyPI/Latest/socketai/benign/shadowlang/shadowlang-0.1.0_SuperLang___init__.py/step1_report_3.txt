  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility script, but without specific context or documentation, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, possibly reads files or network sources depending on the implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or displays output; specific sinks depend on the code content.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from environment variables or input sources to output functions, logs, or network destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected; however, the code structure and purpose remain unclear due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis is limited by the absence of provided code content. Based on standard security review practices, no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident from the provided information. No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. The code does not appear obfuscated, and there are no indications of unusual or harmful behaviors. However, without concrete code, this assessment is based on typical code structures and best practices.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code fragment. The code appears benign, but due to lack of specific code details, this assessment has low confidence.",
