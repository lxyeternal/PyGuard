{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for data processing or configuration management, but without additional context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, reads input data from files or user input, and possibly accesses network resources.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements, writes to files, or sends data over the network. Potentially exposes sensitive data if environment variables or inputs are not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into data processing functions, which may then output data or send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and performs typical data handling operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. It follows standard practices without using obfuscated techniques. The code does not demonstrate malicious intent or malicious payloads. Without additional context, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform routine data processing tasks with no indicators of malicious activity.",
