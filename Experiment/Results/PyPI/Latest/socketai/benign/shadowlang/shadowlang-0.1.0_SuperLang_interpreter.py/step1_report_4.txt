{
  "purpose": "The code implements an interpreter for a custom language, processing a syntax tree, managing variables, and performing computations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from self.data.read(id), input arguments to interpret and interpret_statement functions, and token values in operators.",
  "sinks": "Uses self.data.write(var, value) to write variables, and interprets token values for operations. No external data outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from interpret (input), through interpret_statement (processing), to self.data.read/write for variables, and computations in compute_bin and compute_unary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard operator handling, variable management, and interpretation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard interpretation functions: reading variable types, executing arithmetic and logical operations, managing function definitions, and variable declarations. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious external calls are present. The data flow is straightforward and well-structured. No indications of malicious intent or privacy violations are identified. The use of self.data.read and self.data.write is typical for variable management and does not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate interpreter implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. It processes a syntax tree, manages variables, and executes operations securely. No security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
