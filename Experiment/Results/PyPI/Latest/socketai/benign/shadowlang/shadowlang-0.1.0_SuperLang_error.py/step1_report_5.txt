{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for ShadowScript errors, including specific error types like syntax, runtime, name, and type errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that initialize error objects with error names and details.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "Error details are stored as attributes and passed to the superclass; no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, ShadowScriptError. Each class sets an error name and stores details, then calls the parent constructor with a formatted message. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing operations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and appears to serve as part of an error handling framework.",
