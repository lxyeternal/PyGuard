  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for ShadowScript errors, including specific error types for syntax, runtime, name, and type errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception, with constructors initializing error name and details.",
  "sinks": "Super() method call passing formatted string, no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception objects with error name and details, then passing formatted message to base Exception.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. Code appears to be straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with constructors that set attributes and call the parent constructor with a formatted error message. There are no input sources, external data flows, or sinks that could be exploited. The structure is standard for custom exception handling in Python. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
