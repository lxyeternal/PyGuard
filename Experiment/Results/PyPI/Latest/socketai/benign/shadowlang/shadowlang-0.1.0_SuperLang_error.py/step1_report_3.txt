{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for shadow scripting errors, including specific error types like syntax, runtime, name, and type errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions are static code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base class ShadowScriptError. Each subclass initializes with specific error names and details, passing formatted messages to the superclass. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic features that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The structure and content are typical for custom exception handling. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes for shadow scripting error handling. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk evident in this fragment.",
