  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with specific error types and details.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class inheritance without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class ShadowScriptError and subclasses for specific error types, initializing with error details and passing formatted messages. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is standard, clear, and free of malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. No issues or suspicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes in Python. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
