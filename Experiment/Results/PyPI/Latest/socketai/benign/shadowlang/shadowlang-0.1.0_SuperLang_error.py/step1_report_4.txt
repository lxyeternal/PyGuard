  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for ShadowScript errors, including syntax, runtime, name, and type errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and initializers, particularly the __init__ methods which assign parameters to instance variables.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__ calls which generate the exception message string.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (error_name, details) flow into the exception message via super().__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward, defining exception subclasses without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in ShadowScript. Each class properly initializes its base class with a formatted message. There are no indications of malicious code such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The super().__init__ calls use formatted strings, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code is simple, clear, and maintains best practices for custom exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines standard custom exception classes for error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. It appears to be a normal, benign part of an exception handling module.",
