  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base class ShadowScriptError.\n- Each class initializes with specific error details and passes a formatted message to the superclass.\n- No input/output, external data handling, or dynamic features are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to common Python practices for custom exceptions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is clean, simple, and free of issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, benign, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- They correctly identify the absence of data flows, obfuscation, or external interactions.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nNo changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n- The code is purely class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe risk scores are justified as they reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- All reports agree there's no malware present.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMalware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions or Suspicious Behavior:**\n- The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion based on assumptions.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo unwarranted assumptions or suspicious claims.\n\n---\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
