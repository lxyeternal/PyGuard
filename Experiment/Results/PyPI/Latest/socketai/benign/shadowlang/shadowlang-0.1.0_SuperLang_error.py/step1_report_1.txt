  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for ShadowScript errors, inheriting from a base exception.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; just class inheritance and initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class initializes with specific error details. There are no input/output operations, no external data sources, no obfuscation, nor any suspicious logic or behavior. The structure appears normal for custom error handling in Python. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and legitimate definition of custom exception classes for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
