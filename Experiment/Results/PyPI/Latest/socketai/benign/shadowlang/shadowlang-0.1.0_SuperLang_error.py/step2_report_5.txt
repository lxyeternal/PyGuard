  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from a base class ShadowScriptError.\n- Each class initializes with specific error names and details, passing a formatted message to the parent constructor.\n- There are no external data sources, no I/O, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code matches exactly with the original code provided.\n   - No anomalies, no errors, no suspicious behavior are present.\n   - The classes are simple, static, and do not perform any dynamic or malicious operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The inheritance and constructor usage are correct.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct, code is clear)\n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Security Risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n   \n   The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - No need to elevate the malware or risk scores.\n\n5. **Malicious Behavior or Hidden Intent:**\n   - No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is purely for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (accurate)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (accurate)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (accurate)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The code is standard for defining custom exceptions.\n- No external dependencies or behaviors are present.\n- The code's simplicity and clarity further confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**I agree with the assessments provided in all reports.** The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment poses no security threat and is typical for error handling in Python projects.",
