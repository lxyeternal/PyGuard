  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom error classes in Python.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: all assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only minor point is the use of `super().__init__(f\"{error_name}: {details}\")` in the base class. While this is standard, in some contexts, formatted strings can be misused if `details` contain untrusted input leading to message injection. However, since the code is static and there's no evidence of untrusted input handling, this is not a concern here.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, standard, and safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- No further security concerns or malware indications are present.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. The scores assigned are justified and should remain as-is.",
