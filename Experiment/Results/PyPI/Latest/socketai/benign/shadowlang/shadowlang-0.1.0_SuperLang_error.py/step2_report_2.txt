  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward class inheritance defining custom exception classes. There are no external inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no network or I/O operations. The code appears static and benign.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious behavior.\n- No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk scores**\n\n- Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is trivial class inheritance, these scores are justified.\n- No reason to increase scores based on the current analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All claims are based on straightforward code analysis without assumptions. They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions, often used in error handling modules.\n- No dynamic features, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The consistent high confidence and zero scores across all reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
