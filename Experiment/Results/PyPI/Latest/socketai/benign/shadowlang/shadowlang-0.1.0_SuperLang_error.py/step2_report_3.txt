  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a base exception class `ShadowScriptError` and several subclasses for specific error types (`SyntaxError`, `RuntimeError`, `NameError`, `TypeError`).\n   - The subclasses initialize with a `details` parameter and pass a formatted message to the superclass.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, data outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward class inheritance for custom exception handling.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Review:**\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - The code follows standard Python practices for custom exceptions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other malicious patterns are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n   - Obfuscation scores are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for error handling; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n6. **My Own Estimates:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring aligns with the content. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
