  "purpose": "A simple in-memory data container class with methods to read and write variables, using an attribute of an external object as a key.",
  "sources": "read(id) method accessing self.variables[id], write(variable, expression) method accessing variable.value as key.",
  "sinks": "write() method storing expression in self.variables[variable.value], read() method returning data from self.variables.",
  "flows": "write() uses variable.value as key to store expression; read() retrieves data by id from self.variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable.value as key without validation; no input sanitization or error handling; reliance on external object structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data storage class with minimal logic. The write() method stores data using variable.value as a key, which could be exploited if variable is user-controlled. No network, file, or system calls are present. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The main concern is potential misuse if external control over variable exists, but no active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity justify a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential for misuse without active exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a simple data container. The primary security consideration is the unchecked use of variable.value as a key, which could be misused if manipulated externally. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate, with a low security risk due to lack of validation but no active threats.",
