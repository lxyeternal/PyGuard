  "purpose": "A recursive descent parser for a custom language, converting tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST) with support for expressions, functions, variables, and boolean logic.",
  "sources": "Token list input, token type and value checks, token movement via move() method.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or system modifications; processes tokens internally.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read sequentially; functions and expressions are parsed through recursive calls, with source-to-sink flow limited to token processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a recursive descent parser, handling various expression types and function definitions. It processes tokens without executing external code or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The parser relies solely on token input, and its structure is standard for such language processors. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, external interactions, or malicious code, the code appears benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to trusting the token input, which is inherent in parser design. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and obfuscation is absent. The risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern outside of token trust assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard parser with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, with a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). No modifications are necessary.",
