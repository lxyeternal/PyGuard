{
  "purpose": "A parser for a custom language, handling tokens to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST).",
  "sources": "Reads tokens from input list, especially in methods like parse(), parse_function(), statement(), and move().",
  "sinks": "Processes tokens into data structures; no direct sink functions like eval or eval-based execution observed.",
  "flows": "Tokens are read sequentially, parsed into expressions and function definitions, with flow from source (tokens) to structured output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code structure appears straightforward and standard for a parser.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a recursive descent parser for a custom scripting language, converting tokens into nested structures. No external data is fetched or sent, and no dangerous operations like code evaluation or network activity are present. The token handling is simple and linear, with no evident malicious logic or backdoors. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or credential handling are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard parser implementation without malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to trusting the token input to be safe. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
