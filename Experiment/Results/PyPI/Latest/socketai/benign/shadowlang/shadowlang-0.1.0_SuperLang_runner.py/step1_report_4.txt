{
  "purpose": "This script reads a source code file, tokenizes it, parses it into a syntax tree, and interprets it using custom Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, and Data classes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command line arguments and reads the file content with open(filename, 'r') as f.",
  "sinks": "Passes file content to Lexer for tokenization and subsequently to Interpreter for execution; no direct untrusted data sinks with network or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Command line argument → file read → lexer.tokenize() → parser.parse() → interpreter.interpret()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no network connections, no data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard interpreter workflow: it reads a file specified via command line, tokenizes the content, parses it into an AST, and interprets it. All external inputs are from a specified filename, and there are no apparent insecure operations such as executing untrusted code or making network requests. The code structure is straightforward and appears benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical interpretive process with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes files for interpretation with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
