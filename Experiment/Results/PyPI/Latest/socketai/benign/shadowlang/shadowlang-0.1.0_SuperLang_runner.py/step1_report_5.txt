{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read, parse, and interpret a script file using custom lexer, parser, and interpreter modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a filename provided via command-line arguments, specifically reading the contents of a file with a .shadow extension.",
  "sinks": "The interpreted code may execute within the Interpreter module, which could potentially execute malicious or unsafe code if the input script is malicious.",
  "flows": "The flow is: command-line input -> file reading -> lexer tokenization -> parser -> interpretation. If the interpreted script contains malicious commands, they are executed during the interpret() call.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears straightforward with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a specified file, tokenizes its contents, parses it into a syntax tree, and interprets the script via custom modules. The code relies heavily on external modules (lexer, parse, interpreter) whose content is unknown, so malicious behavior could originate from those. However, based solely on this code, it functions as a typical script runner. No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present in this snippet. The primary security concern is that malicious scripts provided as input could execute harmful commands within the interpreter.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a standard script runner with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code in this snippet. The potential security risk depends entirely on the behavior of the interpreted scripts and the implementation of the external modules. Without further information, the code appears benign but warrants caution regarding the scripts it processes.",
