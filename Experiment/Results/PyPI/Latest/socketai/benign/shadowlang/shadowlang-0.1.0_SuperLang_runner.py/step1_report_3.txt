{
  "purpose": "The code reads a source file, tokenizes it using a Lexer, parses it into a syntax tree, and interprets it using an Interpreter, with data stored in a Data object.",
  "sources": "File input via open(filename), reading contents into the variable 'code'.",
  "sinks": "Interpreter's interpret() method execution, which could potentially execute untrusted code if the interpreted language allows it.",
  "flows": "File content -> Lexer -> Token list -> Parser -> Syntax tree -> Interpreter -> Data, with the execution flow passing through interpret(), which executes the parsed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears straightforward and typical for a language interpreter pipeline. No external network calls or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads and executes a user-specified file through a standard language interpretation pipeline (lexer, parser, interpreter). It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code elements like network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated sections. The main risk depends on the content of the interpreted source file, which is external and not part of this code. The code itself appears benign and follows common interpreter structure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code acts as a driver for interpreting a script file. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within its own logic. The security risk depends on the content of the input file, but the code structure itself is standard and appears safe.",
