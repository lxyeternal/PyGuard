{
  "purpose": "This script reads a source code file, tokenizes it using Lexer, parses it with Parser, and interprets it with Interpreter, likely executing code in a custom language.",
  "sources": "Reading the filename from command line arguments, reading the file content from disk",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no output of untrusted data or external network connections observed",
  "flows": "Command line argument -> file read -> Lexer -> Tokenize -> Parser -> Parse -> Interpreter -> Execute",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected; no obfuscated code or unusual control flows; no network or system modifications observed",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file reading and interprets code through a modular pipeline (Lexer, Parser, Interpreter). It takes a filename argument, reads the content, and processes it through multiple stages. All components are imported from external modules, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident within this code snippet. There are no hidden backdoors, external communications, or code injections, and the code flow is straightforward and typical for an interpreter framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate interpreter runner for a custom language with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The design and implementation are standard for a code interpreter setup.",
