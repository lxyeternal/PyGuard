{
  "purpose": "The code reads a source file, tokenizes it, parses it into a syntax tree, and interprets it, likely executing code from a custom language or script.",
  "sources": "Reading input from a filename provided via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the interpreted code through the Interpreter class.",
  "flows": "Command line argument -> run_file -> file read -> Lexer -> Parser -> Interpreter -> execution of code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to implement a typical interpreter pipeline: reading a file, tokenizing, parsing, and executing interpreted code. It relies on external modules (lexer, parse, interpreter, data), which are not shown. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The process flow is straightforward and consistent with standard interpreters. No suspicious or anomalous code features are detected within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an interpreter driver for a custom language, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain security issues within the provided code. The code appears benign and typical of an interpreter setup.",
