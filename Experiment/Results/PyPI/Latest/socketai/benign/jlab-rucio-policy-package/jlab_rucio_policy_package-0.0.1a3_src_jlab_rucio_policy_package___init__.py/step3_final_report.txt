  "purpose": "Defines a supported Python version and provides a function to import specific modules from a package, returning them in a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Static import statements within the get_algorithms() function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external data",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static imports and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code specifies a minimum Python version and defines a function that imports modules from a package and returns them in a dictionary. There are no dynamic imports, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code serves as configuration or setup code with benign intent. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The static imports and version declaration are standard practices. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
