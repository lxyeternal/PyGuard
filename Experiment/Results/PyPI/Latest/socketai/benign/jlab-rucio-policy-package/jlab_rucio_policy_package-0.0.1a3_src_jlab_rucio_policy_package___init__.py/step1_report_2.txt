{
  "purpose": "Define supported Python version and provide a function to import specific modules from a package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a version string and imports modules within the get_algorithms() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the imports could potentially load external code but are local imports from a known package.",
  "flows": "The get_algorithms() function imports specific functions from the package 'jlab_rucio_policy_package' when called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The import statements are standard, and the version list is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version requirement and a function that imports specific functions from a package. The imports are local to the function, which is a common pattern to delay import until needed. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a normal configuration and import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing version specification and local module imports with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
