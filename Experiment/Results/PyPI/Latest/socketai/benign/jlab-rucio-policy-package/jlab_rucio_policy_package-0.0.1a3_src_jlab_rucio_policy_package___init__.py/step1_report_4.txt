{
  "purpose": "Define a supported Python version and import specific functions from a local package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local package 'jlab_rucio_policy_package' to import functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The imports are static and do not involve dynamic execution or untrusted input; function return does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a supported Python version and defines a function that imports two functions from a local package. The imports are static and occur at function scope, which is standard. No external network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. There are no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for module initialization or setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and intended for importing specific functions from a local package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
