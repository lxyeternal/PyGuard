  "purpose": "Define supported Python version and provide a function to import specific modules from a package.",
  "sources": "The import statements within the get_algorithms() function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily imports modules.",
  "flows": "Code imports modules when get_algorithms() is called; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns detected. The code only performs imports and returns a dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a supported Python version, defines a function that imports specific modules from a package, and returns a dictionary mapping string keys to these imported modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious logic. The import structure is straightforward and does not indicate any malicious intent. No external data inputs, network activities, or data leaks are present. The code appears to serve a configuration or setup purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on module imports and configuration. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
