  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Sets a supported Python version: `SUPPORTED_VERSION = [\">=37.0.0\"]`\n- Defines a function `get_algorithms()` that imports two modules/functions from `jlab_rucio_policy_package` and returns a dictionary mapping string keys to these imported modules/functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of reported issues:**  \n  The reports state that the code is straightforward, with static imports, no external data handling, and no malicious patterns. This aligns with the code, which simply sets a version and defines a function that imports modules locally.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code is standard for configuration/setup.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with very low security risks, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- **Are the scores justified?**  \n  - Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of static imports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n  - Security risk: Very low (0.1 or 0), which matches the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Any overestimation or underestimation?**  \n  The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No such claims are made; all assessments are cautious and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code imports modules within a function, which is good practice to delay import until needed, reducing startup time or circular dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, but the reports already reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the minimal configuration nature)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign intent and the appropriateness of the reported assessments.",
