  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `SUPPORTED_VERSION = [\">=37.0.0\"]`\n- Defines a function `get_algorithms()` that imports two modules/functions from `jlab_rucio_policy_package` and returns a dictionary mapping string keys to these imported modules/functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any external input handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The imports are static and local to the function, which is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code appears to serve configuration/setup purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** The reports correctly identify this as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent in their analysis, emphasizing benign static imports, straightforward structure, and lack of malicious behavior.\n- No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**No errors or flaws are apparent in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores assigned:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with a couple of reports giving 0.1; this seems reasonable since the code is benign but slightly acknowledges the minimal risk associated with imports in security assessments.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they align with the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any high risk scores (>0.5):\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5.  \n- Given the code's benign nature, a higher score would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity.\n- The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they focus on the benign nature of static imports and configuration.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores with the report:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, matching the straightforward assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the evaluations:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero due to import considerations but not a real risk)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to import-related concerns, but not a real security threat)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward, and presents no security or malicious concerns. The scores reflect this well.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis is a standard module setup snippet with no security issues. No further action needed.",
