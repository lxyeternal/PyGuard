  "purpose": "Define supported Python version and provide functions to import specific modules from a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the get_algorithms() function",
  "sinks": "Imported modules could be used elsewhere; no direct sink in this snippet",
  "flows": "Function call to get_algorithms() leads to importing modules from the package",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Imports are straightforward and within expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies a minimum supported Python version and defines a function that imports specific functions from a package. The import statements are local to the function, which is a good practice to avoid top-level import side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leaks. The purpose appears to be to provide access to certain algorithms or functions from the package. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any network or system operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines supported Python version and a function that imports specific modules when called.",
