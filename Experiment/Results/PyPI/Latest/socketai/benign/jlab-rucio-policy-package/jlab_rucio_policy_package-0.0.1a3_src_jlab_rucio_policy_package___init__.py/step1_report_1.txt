  "purpose": "Define supported Python version and provide a function to import specific modules from a package.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are evident in this code.",
  "sinks": "Imports modules within the function; no untrusted data handling or output sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Function import statements do not involve data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version requirement and defines a function that imports specific modules from a package. The imports are static and direct, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code appears to be a standard module initialization or utility code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily facilitates importing specific modules for further use.",
