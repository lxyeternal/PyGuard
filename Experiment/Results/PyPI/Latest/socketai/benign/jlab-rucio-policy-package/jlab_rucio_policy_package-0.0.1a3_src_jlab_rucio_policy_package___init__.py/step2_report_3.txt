  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Code Verification Against Reports**\n\n- The code defines a version string `SUPPORTED_VERSION = [\">=37.0.0\"]`, which matches the description of specifying supported Python versions.\n- The `get_algorithms()` function imports specific modules/functions from `jlab_rucio_policy_package` and returns a dictionary mapping string keys to these imported modules/functions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code matches the descriptions in all reports, with no discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is straightforward, with static imports, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, no external data sources, and no malicious patterns.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, configuration/setup code, and do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**No errors or flaws are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n**3. Review of Scores Assigned**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of external effects.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, indicating minimal concern.\n- Since the code is purely static imports and version declaration, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Therefore, risk scores > 0.5 are unjustified here.**\n\n---\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- Static imports from a known package are benign.\n\n**No challenge here; the malware score is appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they consistently find the code benign.\n- No false positives or unwarranted suspicion are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores align well with the analysis and conclusions.\n- No inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.** The current scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate (Post-Review):\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, almost negligible)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, static import and version declaration snippet, with no external effects or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
