  "purpose": "Convert Logical File Name (LFN) to a physical file path (PFN) by extracting and returning the filename.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: scope, name, rse, rse_attrs, protocol_attrs",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputting the filename as a path",
  "flows": "Input parameters are read but not used directly; the filename 'name' is returned as-is",
  "anomalies": "None; the code appears straightforward with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The function accepts multiple parameters related to file location but ignores all parameters except 'name'. It deletes the unused parameters to avoid warnings. The function simply returns the 'name' parameter as a string path, without any modification or external calls. No input validation, external network access, or sensitive data handling occurs. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a trivial conversion by returning the filename directly. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. The function's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate low likelihood of malicious intent.",
