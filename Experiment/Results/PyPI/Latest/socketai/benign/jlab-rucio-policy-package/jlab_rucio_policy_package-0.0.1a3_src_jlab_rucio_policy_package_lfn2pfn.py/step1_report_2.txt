{
  "purpose": "Convert a logical file name (LFN) to a physical file name (PFN) path by returning the filename part, ignoring other parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters: scope, name, rse, rse_attrs, protocol_attrs",
  "sinks": "Return statement returning 'name' as a string",
  "flows": "Input parameters are ignored or deleted; function returns 'name' directly",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of 'del' on parameters is unusual but benign; no malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The function's purpose is straightforward: it returns the filename 'name' as the PFN path. It explicitly deletes other parameters, which could be seen as cleaning up unused variables but does not pose security risks. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code present. No external libraries or system calls are used. The function appears safe and intentionally simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function that simply returns the filename parameter, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
