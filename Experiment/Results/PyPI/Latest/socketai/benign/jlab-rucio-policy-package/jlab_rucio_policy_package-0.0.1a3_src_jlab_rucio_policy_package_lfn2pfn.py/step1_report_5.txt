{
  "purpose": "Convert a Logical File Name (LFN) to a physical file path (PFN) using a direct mapping that ignores RSE and protocol attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: scope, name, rse, rse_attrs, protocol_attrs",
  "sinks": "Return statement: '%s' % name (outputs the name directly)",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> return statement (returns the name as-is)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; parameters are simply discarded and not used beyond ignoring. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The function explicitly ignores its additional parameters by deleting them, then returns the 'name' parameter directly as the path. There is no dynamic execution, external network interaction, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, simple, and aligns with its stated purpose. No anomalies or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic mapping from LFN to PFN without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a simple utility function with no security concerns.",
