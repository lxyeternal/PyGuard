{
  "purpose": "The function converts a Logical File Name (LFN) to a Physical File Name (PFN) path by returning the filename component, ignoring other parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters: scope, name, rse, rse_attrs, protocol_attrs",
  "sinks": "Return statement: returns the filename as a string",
  "flows": "Input parameters are ignored except for 'name', which is returned as the path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the function simply discards all input parameters and returns the filename",
  "analysis": "The function accepts several parameters but immediately deletes all of them except 'name'. It then returns the filename as-is. There are no external data sources, no use of untrusted input beyond parameters, and no operations that could lead to data leakage or execution of malicious code. The function's behavior is straightforward and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function that returns the filename component for PFN mapping. There are no signs of malicious intent, no external data handling that could lead to security issues, and no obfuscation. It appears safe.",
