  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a permission system based on roles, attributes, and scope ownership. No suspicious or malicious code is detected. The functions rely on external database queries, and no obfuscation or malware is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears to be a standard, role-based access control implementation. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The always-true return in `perm_get_auth_token_ssh` could be a consideration but is not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the report.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the always-true SSH token permission, which could be a security concern but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is permission checks based on attributes and ownership, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code. The functions are consistent, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward permission layer. The functions always returning True for certain actions (e.g., `perm_get_request_by_did`) could be overly permissive but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — very low, standard access control.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a permission system relying on attribute and ownership checks. Some functions always return True, which might be a security consideration but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The always-true functions could be a security concern if they grant excessive permissions, but they are not malicious per se.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to the always-true permissions, which could lead to security issues if misused.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a permission layer for administrative actions, with no malicious code or backdoors. The logic is based on attribute and resource ownership checks.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, standard permission checks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code verifies permissions based on roles, attributes, and ownership, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical permission module, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to permissive functions but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. The code is a straightforward permission system with role and attribute checks.\n- **Malware:** None detected across all reports. The always-true permissions in some functions are security concerns but not malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports due to permissive functions, but not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Potential false assumptions:** No. All assessments are based on code analysis and logical reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (considering permissive functions but no malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, attribute-based permission layer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minor security concern is the always-true permission functions, which should be reviewed for security policy compliance but do not indicate malicious intent.",
