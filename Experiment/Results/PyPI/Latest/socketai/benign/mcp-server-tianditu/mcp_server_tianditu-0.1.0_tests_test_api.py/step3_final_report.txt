{
  "purpose": "Client script interacting with 'tdapi' for geolocation, search, and navigation functions, primarily making API calls with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded location strings, keywords, and parameters; commented API key line indicating potential credential management but not active.",
  "sinks": "External API requests over network transmitting location data and search parameters.",
  "flows": "Code calls API functions with static inputs; no dynamic or untrusted data sources; data flows from static variables to network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors; API key line commented out; no secrets embedded; code straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions for geolocation and navigation without any signs of malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The API key is only a commented placeholder, indicating proper secret management should be enforced. The network requests are typical for such applications and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily around API key handling and data privacy. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, with high confidence (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign client script for a mapping API with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Proper API key management should be implemented in production, but current analysis indicates minimal security risk.",
