{
  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from the mcp_tianditu package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'mcp_tianditu' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'main()' function, which is a sink that executes code defined within the imported module.",
  "flows": "Import statement (source) to function call (sink). The actual flow depends on the content of 'mcp_tianditu.main', which is external.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code within this snippet. Cannot determine if 'mcp_tianditu.main' is malicious without inspecting that module.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only imports and executes a function from an external module. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code in this snippet itself. The security concern relies on the content of the 'mcp_tianditu' package, which is not provided. The code is straightforward and standard for executing a module's main routine.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply calls the main() function from an external package. No immediate malicious behavior is evident within this snippet. However, security assessment depends on the content of 'mcp_tianditu'. Without examining that, no definitive malicious intent can be determined.",
