  "purpose": "Invoke the main function from the mcp_tianditu package/module, likely to run its primary functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement from mcp_tianditu import main",
  "sinks": "Calling main() function; potential sink if main() executes malicious code",
  "flows": "Import mcp_tianditu -> call main() -> execute its code",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; straightforward import and call, no additional code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main function from the mcp_tianditu module and executes it. No inline code, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security risk and malware potential depend on the behavior of the main() function within mcp_tianditu, which is not visible here. This is a standard invocation pattern with no obvious malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module invocation with no inherent malicious behavior. Risks depend entirely on the implementation of mcp_tianditu.main(). No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present in this snippet.",
