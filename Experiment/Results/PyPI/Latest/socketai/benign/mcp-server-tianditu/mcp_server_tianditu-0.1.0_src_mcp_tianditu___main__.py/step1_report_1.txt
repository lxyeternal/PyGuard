{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'mcp_tianditu' package and executes it, likely to run the main functionality of that package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp_tianditu' package",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' executes code from the imported package, which could include data processing, network communication, or other actions",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from package -> invocation of 'main()' -> execution of package code potentially handling data or performing actions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies in the code structure or syntax; minimal code present, relying entirely on external package behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and invocation of a function from a third-party package. Without inspecting the actual 'mcp_tianditu' package, it's impossible to determine if the package contains malicious code. The code itself does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Its security implications depend on the behavior of the imported package, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple and performs a basic import and function call. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior within this code snippet itself. However, security assessment of the 'mcp_tianditu' package is necessary to fully evaluate potential risks. Based solely on this code, the risk appears minimal.",
