  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main() function from the mcp_tianditu package, serving as an entry point to its functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement from mcp_tianditu and the call to main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of mcp_tianditu.main(), which may perform various actions depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import of mcp_tianditu, then calling main() which executes its internal logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this minimal code snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of importing and executing a function from an external package. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of mcp_tianditu.main(), which is not provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no evidence of malicious intent within this snippet. The risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting that the main concern lies in the external package's behavior. Confidence in this assessment is moderate to high, given the simplicity of the code and absence of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and straightforward. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of the external mcp_tianditu package, which cannot be evaluated here. Scores are consistent with the minimal code and external dependency. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.",
