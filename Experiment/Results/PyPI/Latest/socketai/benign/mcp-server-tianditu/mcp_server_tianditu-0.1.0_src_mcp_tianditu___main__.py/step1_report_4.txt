  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'mcp_tianditu' module and executes it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp_tianditu' module",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from the imported module",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> execution of 'main()'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and execution; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a single function from an external module and calling it immediately. No input reading, no data processing within this snippet, and no suspicious patterns observed. The behavior depends entirely on what 'main()' does in 'mcp_tianditu', but within this snippet, there is no malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward import and execution of 'main()'. Without additional context or code within 'main()', there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet.",
