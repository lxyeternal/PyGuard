  "purpose": "Initialize the package and run the server component 'mcp' if executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Importing 'mcp' from '.server', calling 'mcp.run()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'mcp.run()' could potentially execute server code that may accept external input, but the code itself does not handle data directly.",
  "flows": "When executed directly, the script imports 'mcp' and calls its 'run()' method, which may process external input depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed in this snippet; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as an entry point that imports a 'mcp' object from the 'server' module and executes its 'run()' method if run as the main program. There are no direct data sources, user inputs, or network operations in this snippet. The security posture depends on the implementation of 'mcp.run()' in the 'server' module, which is not shown here. The code itself appears standard and non-malicious, acting as a simple bootstrap for server execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python entry point with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet. Its safety relies on the implementation of the 'mcp' object and its 'run()' method in the 'server' module, which are not provided. No indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
