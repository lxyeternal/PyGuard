  "purpose": "Initialize a package and run the main server process.",
  "sources": "Importing mcp from .server module.",
  "sinks": "Calling mcp.run() which likely executes server code; potential if mcp is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Import mcp -> main() -> mcp.run()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in import or function call. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component named mcp from a local module, then defines a main() function that calls mcp.run(). When executed directly, it runs main(). The structure is typical for a Python package entry point. The code itself is minimal and does not contain malicious code or suspicious patterns. The security of the package depends on the implementation of mcp and its run() method, which are not provided here. The code does not perform any malicious activity or include obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple entry point to run a server or process defined in mcp. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet alone. The security risk is low, contingent on the trustworthiness of the imported module.",
