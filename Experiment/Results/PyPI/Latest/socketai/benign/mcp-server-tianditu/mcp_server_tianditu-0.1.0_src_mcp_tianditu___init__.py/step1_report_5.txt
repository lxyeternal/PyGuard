{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run the 'mcp' server module when executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'mcp' from 'server' module; call to 'mcp.run()' in main() function",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' call could potentially be a sink if 'mcp' is malicious or compromised, but without the implementation details, it is a standard invocation",
  "flows": "Import 'mcp' -> main() calls 'mcp.run()' -> program execution proceeds with 'mcp' server logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'mcp' object from the 'server' module and defines a main() function that calls 'mcp.run()'. When executed directly, it runs main(). There are no hardcoded credentials, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs. The actual behavior and security implications depend on the implementation of 'mcp' and its 'run()' method, which are not visible here. The structure is typical for a Python entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple bootstrap for starting a server component, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks evident in this snippet. However, the safety of the overall package depends on the implementation of 'mcp' in 'server'.",
