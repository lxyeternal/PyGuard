  "purpose": "Initialize the package and execute the 'mcp.run()' method when run as a script.",
  "sources": "Importing 'mcp' from the 'server' module",
  "sinks": "Calling 'mcp.run()' which may execute code within the 'mcp' object",
  "flows": "Importing 'mcp' -> calling 'mcp.run()' when executed as a script",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports an object 'mcp' from a local module 'server' and defines a 'main' function that calls 'mcp.run()'. When the script is executed directly, it calls 'main()'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be standard initialization logic for a package or application. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that calls a method from an imported module. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
