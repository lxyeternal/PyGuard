  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point that imports 'mcp' from the local 'server' module and executes its 'run()' method if run as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.server' module, calling 'mcp.run()' in main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'mcp.run()' which may process data or perform actions depending on 'mcp' implementation",
  "flows": "Source: import of 'mcp'; flow: call to 'mcp.run()' in main() when executed as script",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python script initializing and executing 'mcp.run()'. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no anomalies or malicious indicators. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp', which is not provided. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious code detected. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging dependency on external code. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8-1). The code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations itself, and no obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Security concerns are limited to the trustworthiness of 'mcp' and its 'run()' method. Based on the provided snippet and reports, the overall security posture is very low risk, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
