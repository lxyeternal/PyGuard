  "purpose": "Initialize and run the 'mcp' server component when executed as the main program.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'mcp' from the server module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'mcp.run()', which may execute server code, but no direct untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of 'mcp' -> calling 'mcp.run()' within main() -> execution if __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a server component 'mcp' and calls its 'run' method when executed directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python entry-point script. No hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or suspicious patterns are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an entry point to start a server process. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this minimal snippet.",
