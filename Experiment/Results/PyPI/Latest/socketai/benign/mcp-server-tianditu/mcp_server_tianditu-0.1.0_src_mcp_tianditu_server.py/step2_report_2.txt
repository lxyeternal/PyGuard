  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes geocoding, reverse geocoding, search, routing, and resource loading, with data coming from external APIs and local files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls and file reads, with data returned directly; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, relying on imported API functions and local resource files. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The API functions seem legitimate, and resource files are static.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in content, emphasizing standard API calls for geospatial services and resource file reading.\n- No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard implementation, low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on geolocation and routing via API calls and resource files.\n- No malicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate service code, low risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes typical geolocation, search, and routing functions, relying on external APIs and resource files.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, no backdoors, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Normal implementation, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar overview: API wrappers for geolocation, routing, resource loading.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data flows.\n- Conclusion: Standard, safe code, malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper around external APIs, with resource file loading, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, consistent with the analysis. No obfuscation or malware is detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, given the lack of suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Potential Discrepancies:** The reports are consistent and do not overstate risks.\n\n### My Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly above zero, reflecting the external API dependencies and resource file reads, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured geospatial service implementation with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the observed code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues confirmed in the code.  \n- No errors or flawed reasoning in the reports.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- The overall security posture is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.",
