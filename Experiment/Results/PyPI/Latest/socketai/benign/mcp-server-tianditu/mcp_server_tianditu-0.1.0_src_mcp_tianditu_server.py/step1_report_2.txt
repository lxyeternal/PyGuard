{
  "purpose": "This code implements a set of geographic and navigation services including geocoding, reverse geocoding, nearby search, administrative division search, driving, and transit planning, along with resource loading functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided address, latitude, longitude, query strings, and division codes. Data is read from resource files 'resources/AdminCode.txt' and 'resources/Type.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from API calls and resource file reads; no untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions or file writes are directly present, aside from API calls which are typical for service functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into API functions or file reads; API functions process input and produce output data; no suspicious data flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is straightforward, with typical asynchronous API calls and resource file reads. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to provide geographic services by calling external APIs for geocoding, reverse geocoding, search, driving, and transit planning. It reads resource files for administrative codes and data types. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, hidden network connections, or backdoors. The code uses standard patterns for asynchronous API invocation and file I/O. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geographic service wrappers with resource loading. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as intended for geographic information services without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious operations.",
