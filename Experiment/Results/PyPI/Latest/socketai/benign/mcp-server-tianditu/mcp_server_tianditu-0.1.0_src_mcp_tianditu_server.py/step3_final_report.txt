{
  "purpose": "The code provides geospatial services including geocoding, reverse geocoding, nearby search, administrative division search, driving route planning, and transit planning, wrapping external API calls and loading static resource files.",
  "sources": "External API functions (api_addr_to_geocode, api_geocode_to_addr, api_search, api_drive_plan, api_trans_plan) and local resource files ('resources/AdminCode.txt', 'resources/Type.txt')",
  "sinks": "API calls returning data, resource file reads; no untrusted data sinks or malicious data flows identified",
  "flows": "User input data (addresses, coordinates, queries) flow into API functions; results are returned directly without suspicious processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of async wrappers around external geospatial APIs, with static resource file loading. It does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The API functions are used in a standard manner, and resource files are static. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign, API-driven nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured geospatial service implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
