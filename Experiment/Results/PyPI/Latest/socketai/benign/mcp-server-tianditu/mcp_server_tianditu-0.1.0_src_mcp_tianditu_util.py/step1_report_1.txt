  "purpose": "Convert XML strings into dictionaries using Python's standard library (xml.etree.ElementTree).",
  "sources": "xml_string parameter passed to xml_to_dict function, ET.fromstring(xml_string) parsing the XML.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Input xml_string is parsed by ET.fromstring, then processed recursively in _process_element, resulting in a dictionary output.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard XML parsing with no unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The function uses standard XML parsing with xml.etree.ElementTree, handling attributes, child elements, and text content properly. It avoids insecure practices like eval or exec. No external data fetching or network activity is present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic or obfuscation. It solely transforms input XML into a dictionary, which is a common and safe operation. There are no suspicious patterns or behaviors indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe XML to dictionary converter using Python's standard library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
