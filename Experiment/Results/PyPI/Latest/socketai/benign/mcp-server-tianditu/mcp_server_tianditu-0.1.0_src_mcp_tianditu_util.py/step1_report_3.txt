  "purpose": "Convert XML string into a dictionary structure using Python's standard library.",
  "sources": "xml_string input (function parameter), ET.fromstring(xml_string) for parsing XML.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere, no external connections, no file writes or network activity.",
  "flows": "xml_string → ET.fromstring → _process_element → result dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses only standard library functions. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to parse XML into a dictionary, handling attributes, nested elements, and text content. It uses xml.etree.ElementTree from Python's standard library, which is safe. The processing logic is straightforward and well-structured, with no suspicious behavior, no external data transmission, and no insecure handling of inputs. The function performs a standard task with no malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for XML parsing with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It operates solely within the scope of parsing input data into a Python dictionary without external or harmful effects.",
