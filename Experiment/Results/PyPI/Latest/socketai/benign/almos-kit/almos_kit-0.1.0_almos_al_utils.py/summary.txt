  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data analysis and visualization tool used in active learning workflows. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The operational controls involving user prompts and directory deletions are standard but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
