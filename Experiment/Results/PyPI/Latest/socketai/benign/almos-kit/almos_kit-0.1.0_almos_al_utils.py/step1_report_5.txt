{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions and classes for active learning, data processing, PDF report parsing, batch analysis, and convergence monitoring in a machine learning workflow.",
  "sources": "User inputs (e.g., CSV file names, batch numbers), reading CSV files, reading PDF files, directory listings, and dataframes.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (saving options, CSV updates, plots), directory deletion, process termination via sys.exit(), and printing output messages.",
  "flows": "User input and file existence checks lead to reading CSV and PDF data, which is processed to extract metrics; these metrics influence CSV updates, convergence checks, and plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.exit() for control flow interruptions; deletion of directories and log files upon user confirmation; dynamic file path searches; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious language features; no code injection or unsafe SQL; the code interacts with external files and directories but does not execute untrusted code or external commands.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data loading, parsing, and plotting activities with standard Python libraries (pandas, os, re, matplotlib, pdfplumber). It reads user inputs and files, performs file existence checks, extracts data from PDFs with regex, updates CSVs, and generates plots. The use of sys.exit() and directory deletion is controlled by user prompts. No code appears to execute untrusted code, connect to external servers, or perform malicious actions. The file operations and PDF parsing are benign in context. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The overall structure aligns with a legitimate data analysis and active learning monitoring process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation for active learning monitoring, data processing, and visualization. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signatures. It relies on user inputs for critical decisions and interacts only with local files and directories. The code appears safe and intended for scientific or machine learning workflow purposes.",
