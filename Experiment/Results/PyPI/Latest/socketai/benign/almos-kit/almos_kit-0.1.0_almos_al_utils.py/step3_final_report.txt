{
  "purpose": "The code handles data validation, CSV and PDF parsing, convergence monitoring, and plotting within an active learning workflow, facilitating data analysis and visualization.",
  "sources": "CSV files, PDF report pages, filesystem directories, user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "File writes (CSV, plots), directory deletion via shutil.rmtree, process termination with sys.exit().",
  "flows": "Reads CSV and PDF data as sources; processes and analyzes data; outputs plots and updated CSVs; may delete directories or exit based on user prompts.",
  "anomalies": "Uses user prompts for filenames and parameters; deletes directories based on user input; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation, file handling, regex extraction from PDFs, and plotting routines. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. Directory deletion and sys.exit() are operational controls, not malicious. Regex patterns are straightforward, extracting numerical metrics. The code is clear and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation. The only operational concern is reliance on user prompts and directory deletion commands, which could be misused in untrusted environments, but these are not malicious behaviors. The malware score is therefore 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting operational risks rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data analysis and visualization tool used in active learning workflows. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The operational controls involving user prompts and directory deletions are standard but should be used cautiously in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
