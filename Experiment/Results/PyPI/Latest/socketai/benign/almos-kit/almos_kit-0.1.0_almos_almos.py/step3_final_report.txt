{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface dispatcher for the ALMOS package, parsing user arguments and invoking clustering or active learning functions accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via command_line_args(), which are then used to determine which external functions ('cluster' or 'al') to invoke.",
  "sinks": "The script passes user-provided arguments directly to external functions without validation; potential sinks depend on the implementation of 'cluster' and 'al'.",
  "flows": "Source: command_line_args() input -> Decision logic in main() -> Calls to 'cluster' or 'al' with argument dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher that imports functions from external modules and delegates execution based on user input. It does not process data directly or perform risky operations. The external functions' security implications are outside this script's scope. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present within this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign command-line dispatcher with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the external modules it invokes. Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
