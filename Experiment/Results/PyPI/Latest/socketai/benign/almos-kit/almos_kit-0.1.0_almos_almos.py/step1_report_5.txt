{
  "purpose": "Main script for the ALMOS tool that manages clustering and active learning processes based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via command_line_args(), and modules imported from 'almos' package.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or processes untrusted data; no external outputs or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input: command_line_args() provides user arguments -> conditional logic determines which functions to call -> cluster() or al() functions are invoked with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily delegates tasks to imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as an entry point, parsing command-line arguments and calling appropriate functions from the 'almos' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward: load arguments, check options, invoke relevant modules. No suspicious or risky operations are performed within this code snippet itself. Import statements are standard, and the script relies on external, presumably trusted, modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate entry point for the ALMOS tool with no evident malicious intent. It simply manages workflow based on user input. No security risks or malware signals are detected within this fragment.",
