{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for the ALMOS tool, orchestrating clustering and active learning processes based on command line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments via command_line_args() function",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the cluster() and al() functions could be sinks if they process untrusted data; the print statement outputs information to the console.",
  "flows": "Input data from command_line_args() flows into conditional checks, then to cluster() or al() functions depending on arguments; console output occurs if no modules specified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is straightforward, with standard function calls and argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes command-line argument parsing, then conditionally invokes clustering or active learning functions based on user input. It includes a safeguard to warn if no modules are specified. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions imported from the 'almos' package are not detailed here; potential malicious activity could reside within them, but based solely on this script, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard command-line interface for a larger package. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. Its behavior appears benign, serving as a dispatcher for core functionalities implemented elsewhere.",
