{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for the ALMOS tool, orchestrating clustering and active learning processes based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via command_line_args() and user input for module selection (args.cluster, args.al).",
  "sinks": "Calls cluster() and al() functions with arguments; potential for these functions to perform malicious actions depends on their implementation, which is not shown.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments → command_line_args() → args object → conditional logic → cluster() or al() functions with arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI dispatcher. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific functions from the 'almos' package and uses a main() function to parse command-line arguments. It checks whether the user has specified clustering or active learning modules and calls respective functions accordingly. The code includes standard input/output operations and conditional logic. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The actual security of the package depends on the implementation of imported functions, which are not provided. Overall, the code appears to be a typical command-line interface wrapper for a larger library, with no malicious intent visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a command-line dispatcher for the ALMOS package, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Its security depends on the safety of imported modules, which are not shown. No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present.",
