{
  "purpose": "The code manages an active learning workflow for a molecular prediction model, including data handling, model updating, prediction generation, and plotting results.",
  "sources": "Data is read from CSV files, predictions are read from CSV files, and command-line arguments are used to configure model runs.",
  "sinks": "External commands execute Python modules ('robert') for model training and prediction, and files are copied, moved, and deleted based on their existence and process outcomes.",
  "flows": "Data from CSV files are processed and fed into model update commands; predictions are read and used to update datasets; results are saved and organized into directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No unusual or misleading variable names or logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. All external commands are related to model training and prediction; these are typical in data workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data science workflow steps: data loading, model updating via subprocess commands, predictions, and plotting. External system calls execute known Python modules ('robert') with command-line parameters, which appear to be standard model operations. File handling involves moving, copying, and deleting files based on process success, with no signs of malicious file access or system modification. No embedded malicious logic, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on external, documented tools and modules, with no indicators of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an active learning pipeline for molecular prediction models, with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical data processing, model training, and prediction tasks without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
