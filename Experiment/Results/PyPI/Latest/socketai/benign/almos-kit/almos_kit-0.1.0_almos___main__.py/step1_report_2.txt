{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the entry point for executing the 'almos' package, primarily intended to run the main function of the 'almos' module when executed directly.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (if any), command-line arguments, and attempts to import the 'almos' module.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'almos.main()' which may execute code within the 'almos' package; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment/command-line inputs → import 'almos' → call 'almos.main()' → program exit.",
  "anomalies": "The script checks if the package is installed; if not, it outputs a message guiding user to install 'almos'. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as a simple launcher for the 'almos' package. It imports the necessary module and executes its main function if run as the main program. The only conditional behavior is a print statement guiding installation if 'almos' isn't installed. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard entry point for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious code detected.",
