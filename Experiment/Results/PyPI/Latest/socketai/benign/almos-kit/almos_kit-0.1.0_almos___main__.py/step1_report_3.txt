{
  "purpose": "This script is the entry point for running the 'almos' package, intended to execute its main function.",
  "sources": "The script reads the '__package__' variable, imports the 'almos' module, and accesses 'almos.main()'.",
  "sinks": "The script calls 'almos.main()', which could potentially contain untrusted data handling, but that is outside this code's scope.",
  "flows": "The flow is: check if not in 'almos' package -> print warning if needed -> call 'almos.main()' -> exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The script simply manages package execution with a standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with shebang and a comment header. It imports necessary modules, checks if the script is run within the 'almos' package context, and if not, prints an informational message. When executed directly, it calls 'almos.main()' and exits. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks. The check for '__package__' is benign and serves as an environment verification. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward entry point script for the 'almos' package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment checks and invokes the main functionality provided by the package.",
