  "purpose": "Main entry point for executing the 'almos' package, providing instructions if not installed and running the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__ import), sys module, almos module, __package__ variable, print function, almos.main() call, sys.exit()",
  "sinks": "almos.main() execution (which may invoke further untrusted code), print statement for user instructions",
  "flows": "Importing modules and checking __package__ status -> printing instructions if not installed -> calling almos.main() -> exiting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The check for __package__ != 'almos' with a print statement could be used to signal installation issues but is not malicious. No obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple launcher for the 'almos' package, with a check for whether the package is installed. If not, it prints a user guidance message. If run directly, it calls almos.main() and exits. The code structure is straightforward, with standard Python idioms. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The only potential concern is the invocation of almos.main(), which depends on the external library, but this is normal for a main entry point. The print statement is benign and provides user instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard launcher script for the 'almos' package with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
