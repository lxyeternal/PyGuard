{
  "purpose": "This script serves as the entry point for the 'almos' package, checking package context and invoking its main function.",
  "sources": "The script reads the module's __package__ attribute and the __name__ variable; it also imports the 'almos' package.",
  "sinks": "The script calls 'almos.main()', which could be a sink if malicious, but within this script, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: __package__ and __name__; Sink: almos.main() call; Flow: Checks package context, then invokes external main function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The only notable point is the package check, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python launcher script with minimal logic. It verifies package context and calls an external main function. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The security implications depend on the 'almos' package, which is outside this code's scope. The script itself is benign, with no network activity or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward entry point script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external 'almos' package. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
