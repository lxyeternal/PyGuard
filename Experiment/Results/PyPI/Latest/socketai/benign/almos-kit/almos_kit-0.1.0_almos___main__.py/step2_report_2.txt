  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a simple entry point for the 'almos' package.\n- It checks if the package is installed via `__package__ != 'almos'`.\n- If not installed, it prints a user guidance message.\n- When run directly (`__name__ == '__main__'`), it calls `almos.main()` and then exits.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no suspicious behaviors.\n- The execution of `almos.main()` depends on the external package, but this is standard for a launcher script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious code.\n- The only \"issue\" is the check `if __package__ != 'almos'`, which is benign and for user guidance.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code.\n- The logic is sound for a launcher script.\n- The check for package installation is standard, though it could be improved for robustness, but that's outside the scope of security.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, since the script merely calls an external module.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that `almos.main()` could be malicious, but this is outside the scope of this script.\n- The script itself does not process untrusted data, network, or credentials.\n\n### Consistency and reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9-1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, mainly due to reliance on external code)\n\n**Note:** Since the core concern is whether this script could be malicious, the answer is no. The actual security risk hinges on the content of `almos.main()`, which is outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code, no suspicious behavior detected.        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.           |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Minimal; depends on external package, but script itself is benign. |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is a benign launcher with no security issues.",
