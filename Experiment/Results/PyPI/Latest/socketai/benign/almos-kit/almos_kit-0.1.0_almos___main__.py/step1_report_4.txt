{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for executing the 'almos' module, providing instructions for installation and running the main function.",
  "sources": "Reads from the '__main__' module context and imports the 'almos' package.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'almos.main()', which could potentially execute code within the 'almos' module.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'almos' and then invokes 'almos.main()' if run as the main program, passing control to the 'almos' module's main function.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a print statement alerting if 'almos' is not installed, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a bootstrap script, checking the installation status of 'almos' and executing its main function. It uses standard Python practices with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The only potential concern is that if 'almos.main()' contains malicious code, this script would execute it, but this depends entirely on the content of 'almos', which is outside the scope of this file. The script itself does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign entry-point script for the 'almos' package. It checks for proper installation and executes the main function, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this code snippet.",
