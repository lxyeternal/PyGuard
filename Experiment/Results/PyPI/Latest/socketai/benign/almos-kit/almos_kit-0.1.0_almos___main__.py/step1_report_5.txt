{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for executing the 'almos' package, primarily to run the almos.main() function when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution environment (via __name__ and __package__) and imports the 'almos' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls almos.main() and sys.exit(), which could execute external or untrusted code if 'almos' is compromised.",
  "flows": "The script checks if the package is correctly installed, then invokes almos.main(), which may process untrusted input within that function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The only notable aspect is the reliance on an external package 'almos' which could be malicious if compromised, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a simple wrapper to execute the main function of the 'almos' package. It performs a check on __package__ and prints a message if not installed, then proceeds to run almos.main(). No user input handling, network calls, or data processing is visible. The structure is straightforward and standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this script itself. Risks depend entirely on the integrity of the 'almos' package which is imported and executed here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical entry script with minimal logic, mainly for executing 'almos.main()'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues in this code alone. The security posture depends on the 'almos' package itself. Overall, no malicious intent is apparent.",
