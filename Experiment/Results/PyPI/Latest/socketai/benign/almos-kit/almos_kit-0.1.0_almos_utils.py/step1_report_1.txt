  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for argument parsing, logging, dependency checking, and environment setup for the ALMOS framework.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), reads and writes to log files, executes subprocess commands to check dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for dependency checks; reading sys.argv for input parameters; writing logs to files and console.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> load_variables and set_options -> dependency checks via subprocess -> logging outputs",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual code behaviors. Dependency checks are straightforward. The code handles argument parsing securely and properly logs actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles argument parsing, environment setup, and dependency verification. It uses subprocess to check for required packages like 'obabel' and 'aqme' via command-line calls, and checks for Python package imports and conda packages. These are standard, safe procedures. No malicious or backdoor code is detected. The logging mechanism is basic but does not execute code or handle untrusted data beyond standard subprocess calls. The dependency checks and file operations are typical and do not pose security threats. Overall, the code performs environment validation and argument processing without suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for argument parsing, environment validation, and logging in the ALMOS framework. It performs standard dependency checks using subprocess and handles arguments securely. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior are present.",
