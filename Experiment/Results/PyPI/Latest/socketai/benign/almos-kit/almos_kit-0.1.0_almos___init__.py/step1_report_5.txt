  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs data processing or a basic utility function.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input or local files; uses environment variables; possibly fetches external data via network requests.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console or files; may send data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Input sources are processed through functions, with potential outputs sent to console or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard data processing routines. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code structure and variable naming are normal. The usage of environment variables and external calls appears typical for configuration purposes. No anomalies in flow or data handling are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code. It appears to be a benign utility or data processing script.",
