  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external dependencies, environment variables, data handling functions",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data leaks",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (notably in report 4), hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, unexplained data flows",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 show no obfuscation or malicious activity, with scores appropriately set to 0 or near 0. Report 4 exhibits obfuscation (score 0.6) and minor suspicion (malware score 0.2), justified by code complexity but no confirmed malicious behavior. Risk scores are generally low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Slight adjustments are recommended: increasing malware score in report 4 to 0.3 to account for obfuscation concerns, and setting obfuscation in report 4 at 0.6 remains justified. Overall, the code appears safe, with no active malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation in report 4 warrants cautious scoring but does not indicate confirmed malicious behavior. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and overall security risk remains low.",
