  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or system interaction, but the exact goal cannot be determined due to lack of context and code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs via functions like input(), file reads, or network requests; however, specific sources cannot be identified because no code is provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data leaks; specific sinks are not evident without the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks is undetermined due to missing code content, preventing detailed source-to-sink path analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns can be identified without the actual code. The prompt does not include any code snippet or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to absence of code. The process would typically involve checking for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or unusual logic, none of which can be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code content to evaluate security or malicious intent. No evidence of malware or security risks can be identified without the actual source code.",
