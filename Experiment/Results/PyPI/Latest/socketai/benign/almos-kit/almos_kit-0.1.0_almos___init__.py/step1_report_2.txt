  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, possibly for a larger application or utility.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and external modules or functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements, writes to files, or sends data over network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions or logic, potentially reaching output sinks such as print, file, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code does not contain obfuscation or unusual language features. No signs of malicious activity or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes variables and imports standard libraries. It processes input data and performs computations without unusual patterns. There are no code injections, insecure data handling, or insecure external calls. The structure and behavior are consistent with typical open-source Python code. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious function calls are present. All external dependencies appear standard and are used in a conventional manner.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indications of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
