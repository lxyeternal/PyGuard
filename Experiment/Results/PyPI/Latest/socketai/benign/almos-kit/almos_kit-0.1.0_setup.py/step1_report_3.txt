  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'almos_kit' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling, network calls, or sensitive information exposure.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from setup parameters to package metadata and dependencies; no external untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package information, dependencies, and package data without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic execution methods; no network calls, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling observed. The dependencies are all specified explicitly with version constraints, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The package metadata appears legitimate and typical for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious elements.",
