  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard setup.py configuration script.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is identified.\n- All dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed or range versions, reducing supply chain risk.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code is static and straightforward, typical for package setup scripts.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign `malware=0`, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- `obfuscated=0` is consistent; no obfuscation detected.\n- `securityRisk=0` matches the benign nature.\n- `confidence=1` across all reports is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniform and thorough; no contradictions or suspicious claims.\n- The dependency list appears legitimate; no unusual packages or version ranges that could be malicious.\n- The URLs and author info are static and related to the project, with no signs of tampering.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final assessment:**\nThe setup script is a typical, safe package configuration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
