  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'almos_kit' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including package data, URLs, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated elements. Dependencies are explicitly versioned, and URLs are static. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores or content are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
