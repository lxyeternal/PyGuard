  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious code patterns, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are mentioned.\n- Dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions, which reduces supply chain risk.\n- No untrusted data handling or external input processing is present.\n- The code appears benign, typical, and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the original provided code. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- All reports agree that the script is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are identified in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate: the code is a typical setup script with no malicious features.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **confidence:** 1\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, the scores of 0 are justified.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified because all reports agree and the code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; all evidence points to benign code.\n- No suspicious behaviors are claimed or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, benign setup.py script.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- Scores are justified and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The package setup appears safe and well-structured.",
