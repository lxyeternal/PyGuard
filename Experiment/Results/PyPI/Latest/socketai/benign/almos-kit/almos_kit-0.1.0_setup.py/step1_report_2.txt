  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project called 'almos_kit', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup() function parameters, including package data, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external inputs/outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations; typical package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and data files without any dynamic or malicious code. No external input handling, network operations, or code that could be malicious are present. The dependencies are specific versions, reducing the risk of supply chain issues. The overall structure appears normal for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration for 'almos_kit'.",
