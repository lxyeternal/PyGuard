  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets are predominantly benign, with no definitive malicious activity detected. Slight obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious risk assessment but do not constitute malware. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a recommended slight increase in obfuscated score for report 4 from 0 to 0.2 to better reflect the suspicion of obfuscation. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use, with low malware and risk scores."
