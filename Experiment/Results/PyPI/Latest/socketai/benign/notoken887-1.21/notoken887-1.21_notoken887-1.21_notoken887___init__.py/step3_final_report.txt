  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as user input, environment variables, dynamic imports, reflection, network connections, or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to network endpoints, file systems, or system commands that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Sources like user input or environment variables flow into processing functions, possibly leading to network transmission, file writing, or system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, reflection, or complex constructs that could conceal malicious intent; inconsistent or suspicious use of dynamic imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying degrees of obfuscation and dynamic features. Most snippets show benign patterns with no evidence of malicious payloads. Obfuscation scores are generally low to moderate, justified by mentions of complex constructs. Dynamic imports and reflection in some cases raise suspicion but lack concrete malicious activity, leading to moderate risk scores. Malware scores remain at zero across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. Confidence levels align with the completeness and clarity of each code sample. The overall security posture appears low risk, with minor concerns about obfuscation and dynamic features in specific cases.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets are predominantly benign, with no definitive malicious activity detected. Slight obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious risk assessment but do not constitute malware. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a recommended slight increase in obfuscated score for report 4 from 0 to 0.2 to better reflect the suspicion of obfuscation. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use, with low malware and risk scores.",
