  "purpose": "Implements a reversible substitution cipher with optional prefixing, used for encoding and decoding tokens.",
  "sources": "Input token to encrypt or decrypt functions; characters within the token string.",
  "sinks": "Transformation tables (replacement_table and decryption_table) for character substitution; string reversal operations.",
  "flows": "Input token -> character substitution -> string reversal -> prefix addition (encryption); prefix removal -> string reversal -> character substitution (decryption).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No obfuscation beyond simple substitution and reversal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic substitution cipher with a reversible process, adding a prefix during encryption. No external data sources or network activity. The cipher is weak but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no additional findings. The implementation is simple, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic reversible substitution cipher with no malicious features. The absence of detailed reports suggests no detected issues. The security risk is minimal, but the cipher's weakness should be noted. No malware or malicious activity is present.",
