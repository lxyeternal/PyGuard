  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code appears to implement a simple substitution cipher with reversible mappings.\n- The `encrypt` method replaces certain characters based on `replacement_table`, then reverses the string and prefixes with \"ENC#\".\n- The `decrypt` method removes the prefix if present, reverses the string, then applies `decryption_table` to recover original characters.\n\n**Observation:**  \n- The code seems logically consistent for basic substitution and reversal encryption/decryption.\n- No obvious vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident from this implementation alone.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, external calls, or file operations that could be malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No issues or vulnerabilities are apparent in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review the reports**\n\n- All reports are empty responses with the error \"Empty response\" and no raw response content.\n- This suggests that the reports do not contain any analysis, findings, or assessments.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores and claims**\n\n- Since no specific issues are reported, the risk, malware, or obfuscation scores should logically be minimal or zero.\n- Without evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should be 0.\n- Without obfuscation or hidden malicious intent, the obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The risk score should be low, given the lack of any reported vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Step 4: Critical assessment**\n\n- The code is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation beyond simple character replacement and reversal.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified based solely on this code.\n- The reports do not provide any findings or reasoning to justify higher scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no evidence of obfuscation beyond simple substitution)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it's an encryption/decryption class, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are empty and do not justify any concern. The code itself appears benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the absence of any detected issues or malicious intent.",
