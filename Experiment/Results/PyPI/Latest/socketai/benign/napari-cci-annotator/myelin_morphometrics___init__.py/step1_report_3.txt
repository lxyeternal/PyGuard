{
  "purpose": "The code provides various geometric and morphological functions for image processing, boundary smoothing, coordinate transformations, and convex hull analysis, likely for morphological or structural analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as `lbl_data`, `BW`, `boundary`, `points`, and `convex_hull`, and also from numpy array inputs. No external data sources or untrusted input streams are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations and returns results; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident. No network connections, file writes, or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (images, boundaries, points) through processing functions like `get_BW_from_lbl`, `get_width`, `smoothBoundary`, and `minBoundingBox`, resulting in processed geometric data or metrics. No dangerous data flow paths such as command execution or data exfiltration are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for geometric and morphological processing, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. Comments and structure are clear and typical. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions performing image labeling, morphological measurements, boundary smoothing, coordinate rotation, bounding box calculations, and convex hull analysis. All operations rely on standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, skimage). The functions include input validation, shape assertions, and mathematically sound geometric computations. No code injects data into external systems, manipulates environment variables, or performs malicious actions. The overall design is consistent with scientific image analysis without any indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate set of image processing and geometric analysis functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely within the scope of scientific computation without any suspicious network, file, or system interactions. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
