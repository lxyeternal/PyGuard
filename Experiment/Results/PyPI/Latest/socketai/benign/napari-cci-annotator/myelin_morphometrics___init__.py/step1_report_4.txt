{
  "purpose": "This code provides various utility functions for image and geometric shape analysis, including extracting labeled objects, computing widths, smoothing boundaries, rotating points, and calculating minimum bounding boxes for convex hulls.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include labeled images (`lbl_data`), binary images (`BW`), boundary point arrays (`boundary`), and 2D point arrays (`points`, `points_2D`, `convex_hull`, etc.). These are read from parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into mathematical operations, array manipulations, and geometric calculations. No sinks directly involve untrusted data affecting system or network actions; outputs are geometric data or processed arrays.",
  "flows": "The data flow is primarily from input parameters (labels, binary masks, boundary points, points) through computations like masking, morphological operations, smoothing, rotations, and bounding box calculations, ending in geometric outputs (e.g., width, rotated points, bounding box corners). No external system interactions or network communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; it uses standard scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image). There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. Commented-out code (e.g., in `smoothBoundary`) is benign. No hidden or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs common image processing and geometric computations using well-established libraries. Assertions and input validation prevent misuse. No code appears to be malicious or sabotaging; functions are typical for image analysis, shape fitting, and geometric transformations. No external network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions operate solely on the provided input data, and no suspicious behavior or malware patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for image and shape analysis with standard implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code is consistent with legitimate computational geometry and image processing tasks, and it does not perform any harmful actions or contain hidden malicious logic.",
