{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for image segmentation, morphological measurements, boundary smoothing, geometric transformations, and shape analysis, primarily for processing and analyzing 2D images and contours.",
  "sources": "Input data includes labeled images (lbl_data), binary masks (BW), boundary point arrays, and coordinate point arrays; these are read from function arguments and are processed locally.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communications, or system modifications are present; data flows are confined within local computations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through validation, processing functions (e.g., get_BW_from_lbl, get_width, smoothBoundary, rotate_points, minBoundingBox), with no external or untrusted data affecting system state or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected. The code relies on standard scientific libraries and performs legitimate geometric and image processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured, documented functions performing standard image and shape analysis operations. Input validation is thorough, and no external or system-level actions are taken. The functions do not include network calls, file I/O, or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The functions are designed for legitimate scientific computation, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for image and geometric analysis, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
