{
  "purpose": "Provides various geometric and morphological utility functions for image and shape analysis, such as object extraction, boundary smoothing, rotation, bounding box computation, and convex hull analysis.",
  "sources": "Data read from input arguments: lbl_data, BW, boundary, angle, points, convex_hull; No external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data leakage, network communication, or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily internal calculations: label extraction, morphological operations, geometric transformations, and shape analysis. No external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed. Code uses standard scientific libraries with legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for image morphology, boundary smoothing, geometric transformations, and shape analysis. It performs assertions and input validation, uses standard libraries like numpy, scipy, and skimage, and implements common algorithms such as rotating calipers. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or hidden behavior detected. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of shape and image processing utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs geometric and morphological computations using standard, open-source libraries. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior found.",
