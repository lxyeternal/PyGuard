{
  "purpose": "Detects available hardware acceleration backends (GPU or CPU) using torch and openvino.runtime.Core, returning status and device/backend names.",
  "sources": "import statements for torch and openvino, calls to torch.cuda.is_available(), core.available_devices, and access to _config constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Import libraries -> check device availability -> set backend info -> return status and device/backend name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward logic; no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection for hardware acceleration support via standard libraries, handling missing dependencies gracefully. It reads configuration constants but does not process user input or transmit data. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is clear and standard, with no security issues or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hardware detection utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
