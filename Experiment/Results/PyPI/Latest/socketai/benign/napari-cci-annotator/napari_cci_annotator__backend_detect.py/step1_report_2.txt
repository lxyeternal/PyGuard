{
  "purpose": "Selects and lists available computational backends, specifically checking for GPU support via Torch or OpenVINO.",
  "sources": "Imports torch and openvino.runtime.Core; accesses torch.cuda.is_available() and core.available_devices.",
  "sinks": "Returns backend status and names; no data leaks or insecure output handling; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> Checks device availability -> Retrieves device names or backend identifiers -> Returns results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow; logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to detect GPU support via torch.cuda and openvino.runtime.Core, returning status and device/backend names. It imports known libraries, checks device availability, and uses configuration constants from _config. No user input handling, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution present. The code's structure and logic are standard for hardware detection. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for detecting available hardware backends. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious activities or data leaks.",
