{
  "purpose": "The code processes labeled images to extract morphometric features of cellular structures, mainly focusing on myelin regions, and outputs the data as an Excel file.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'label_image' and 'data_image' passed into functions; data reading occurs in regionprops_table, label filtering, and image slicing operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is compiled into pandas DataFrames and saved to an Excel file; no direct data leak sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input images through morphological operations, feature extraction, and filtering functions, finally aggregated and written to a file. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are detected.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hard-coded secrets, or backdoors. The code heavily relies on image processing libraries with no obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of image processing functions and data handling routines focused on morphological analysis of labeled regions. It uses standard libraries (scikit-image, scipy, pandas) and custom 'morpho' functions for operations like smoothing boundaries, rotation, bounding box calculations, and filtering small objects. No code segments perform network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration. Exception handling is present but limited to catching errors in bounding box calculations and data processing, without malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are embedded. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate image analysis tasks with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing pipeline for extracting cellular morphometrics with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The overall security risk is very low.",
