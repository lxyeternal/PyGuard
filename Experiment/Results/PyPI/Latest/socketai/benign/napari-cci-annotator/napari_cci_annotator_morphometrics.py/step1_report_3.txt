{
  "purpose": "This code performs morphological analysis of labeled images, extracting various features related to myelin and associated structures, and saves the results to an Excel file.",
  "sources": "Reads label and data images for each region from 'label_image' and 'data_image'; uses regionprops_table to extract region properties; loads external modules like skimage, scipy, pandas, and numpy.",
  "sinks": "Writes output data to an Excel file; no other explicit data sinks or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input images through segmentation and morphological processing functions, culminating in the generation of feature tables that are exported as an Excel file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard scientific Python libraries and straightforward image processing methods. No evident malicious code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image segmentation, boundary smoothing, bounding box calculations, and feature extraction, all using publicly available scientific libraries. No unusual or unauthorized data access, network activity, or code behaviors indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts identified. The only operations involve standard image processing and data storage procedures, with a commented-out plotting section that is harmless. The presence of multiple commented-out sections and detailed processing logic indicates an emphasis on data analysis rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific image analysis script for morphological measurements, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly processes input images, extracts features, and outputs results. There is no evidence of malware, data theft, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
