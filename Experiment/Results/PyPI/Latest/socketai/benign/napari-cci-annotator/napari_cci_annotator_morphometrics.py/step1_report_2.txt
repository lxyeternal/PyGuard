{
  "purpose": "The code performs image processing and morphometric analysis on labeled regions within 2D images, specifically calculating geometrical and shape features of labeled objects, primarily myelin regions, for scientific analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads label images (`label_image`) and data images (`data_image`) from inputs; extracts region properties using `regionprops_table`; reads image regions and contours for morphological computations.",
  "sinks": "Does not write to files or network, but generates and processes image data and region properties internally; outputs results as an Excel file.",
  "flows": "Source data (label and image regions) are processed through various functions (`bbox_from_BWimg`, `get_box_with_rotation`, `get_morphos_for_label_data`) which compute geometrical features, then aggregated into tables and exported to Excel.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious data leaks are present. Usage of warnings, exception handling, and image processing functions are typical for scientific code. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple image processing routines for shape analysis, using well-known libraries like `skimage`, `scipy`, and `numpy`. It reads label and data images, computes convex hulls, bounding boxes, and shape features. Exception handling is used around critical processing steps to prevent crashes. No network, file system manipulations (other than exporting to Excel), or external communications are present. The functions operate purely on input data and produce numerical outputs for analysis. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code structure and logic appear typical for scientific image analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing script for morphological analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs data analysis and exports results. No malware or malicious behavior is identified.",
