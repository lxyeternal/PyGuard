{
  "purpose": "The code performs morphological analysis of labeled microscopy images to extract features such as bounding boxes, areas, eccentricity, solidity, and feret diameters, then compiles these metrics into an Excel report.",
  "sources": "Reads label images, binary masks, and data images from internal variables; uses regionprops_table and custom functions for boundary and bounding box calculations.",
  "sinks": "Exports the resulting metrics DataFrame to a local Excel file; no external network or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Processes label and image data through internal functions, computes features, and writes output locally; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication; commented-out plotting code is harmless and typical for scientific scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard scientific libraries for image processing and feature extraction, with exception handling for robustness. No network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. Custom module 'myelin_morphometrics' is assumed to perform legitimate boundary smoothing and bounding box calculations. No obfuscation techniques or malicious behaviors are detected. The data flow is contained within the local environment, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific image analysis pipeline with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
