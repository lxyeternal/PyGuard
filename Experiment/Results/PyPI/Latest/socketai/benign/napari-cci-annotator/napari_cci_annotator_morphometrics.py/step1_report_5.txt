{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze and extract morphological features from labeled images of biological structures, particularly myelin and associated regions, for research or diagnostic purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from label images (`label_image`) and data images (`data_image`) within functions such as `morpho_data_generator`, `get_morphos_for_label`, and `create_morpho_table_from_data`. It also reads properties from regionprops_table and label data in multiple locations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write untrusted data to external systems, nor does it execute commands based on untrusted input. It primarily processes image data and outputs results into an Excel file. There are no network transmissions, system calls, or external command executions found in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from image inputs (`label_image`, `data_image`) through processing functions like `get_morphos_for_label_data`, which compute features and return dataframes. These dataframes are aggregated in `create_morpho_table_from_data` and written to an Excel file. No external untrusted data or user input influences control flow or data outputs beyond image data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward image processing methods. There are warnings and exception handling, but nothing indicative of malicious intent. The code appears consistent with scientific data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image analysis using well-known libraries (`skimage`, `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`) to compute morphological features. It processes labeled images, calculates bounding boxes, convex hulls, and other shape metrics, and outputs results to an Excel file. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or credential handling are present. Exception handling is used to manage processing errors, but it does not involve untrusted code execution. There are no indications of malware or sabotage activities. The functions are focused on image feature extraction, with logical and safe code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific image processing script that extracts morphological features from labeled biological images. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate tool for research purposes, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or data exfiltration. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
