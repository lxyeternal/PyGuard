{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze and extract morphological metrics from labeled biological image data, specifically related to myelin structures in microscopy images.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from label images, binary masks, and image data arrays. Uses regionprops_table and label functions to extract object properties.",
  "sinks": "Returns data in pandas DataFrames, writes results to Excel files. No evident sinks that send data externally or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from label images and data arrays; properties are computed and stored in DataFrames; final results are saved as Excel files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code extensively uses image processing functions and external libraries with no apparent obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs image processing and morphometric analysis of labeled regions. It imports standard scientific libraries (scikit-image, scipy, pandas, numpy) and custom modules (myelin_morphometrics). The functions handle image segmentation, bounding box calculations, and property extraction. No code sections perform network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code patterns are present. The only noteworthy behavior is the generation of warnings for questionable region properties, which are part of data validation. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, complex image analysis pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes biological images to extract morphological metrics and saves results locally. No evidence of malware, data theft, backdoors, or malicious network activity is detected.",
