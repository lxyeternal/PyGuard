{
  "purpose": "The code manages annotations for a GUI application, allowing for sorting, data handling, and report generation related to morphometric data and labels.",
  "sources": "Data is read from morpho_data_generator() in _add_annotations; label_image and data_image inputs to add_annotations_to_model; data access within _add_annotations and generate_xls_report.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in QStandardItemModel and pandas DataFrame, used for display and export; no immediate untrusted sink beyond data export.",
  "flows": "Data flows from morpho_data_generator into the model; user interactions can query data via get_label_for_row, get_coordinates_for_row, get_status_msg_for_row; export function saves DataFrame to Excel.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external connections; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; use of ThreadPoolExecutor for asynchronous tasks is typical but should be reviewed for external communication risks. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data processing and GUI model management, with data flowing from generator functions into models and then possibly exported. The data handling appears standard, with no external network calls, command execution, or data exfiltration routines. The use of ThreadPoolExecutor is contained within the class for asynchronous annotation addition, which is normal for performance optimization. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external dependencies, or obfuscated code are present. The data export via pandas is straightforward and local. Overall, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions as an application-specific data handler and GUI component.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code performs standard data processing and GUI management tasks for annotations. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The use of threading and data export is typical and secure within the given context. Overall security risk is low.",
