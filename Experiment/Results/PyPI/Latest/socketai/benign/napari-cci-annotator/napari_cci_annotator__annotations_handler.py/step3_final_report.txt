{
  "purpose": "The code manages annotation data within a GUI, loading data from a generator, populating models, and exporting to Excel.",
  "sources": "Data is read from morpho_data_generator, pandas DataFrames, and user interactions within the GUI.",
  "sinks": "Data is exported to an Excel file via pandas' to_excel method; no network or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the generator into the model, then to the GUI display, and finally to file export.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard GUI components and data processing libraries, with threading for asynchronous operations. No external network activity or malicious patterns are present. Data handling appears secure and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured GUI component for annotation management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
