{
  "purpose": "Provides a basic numpy reader plugin for napari to load .npy files as image layers.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from input parameters; loads files using np.load() on provided paths.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input path -> np.load() in reader_function -> data returned as layer data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious variables. Uses standard numpy functions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple implementation of a napari plugin to read numpy files. It accepts file paths, filters for .npy files, loads them with np.load(), stacks arrays, and returns the data as a layer. No external network connections, no code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The np.load() function is used safely with controlled input; no untrusted data is executed or written. Overall, the code is standard and lacks suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward numpy reader plugin for napari with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for loading numpy files without exposing security risks.",
