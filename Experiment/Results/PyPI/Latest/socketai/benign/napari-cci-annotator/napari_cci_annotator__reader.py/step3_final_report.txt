  "purpose": "Load .npy files into napari as image layers, stacking multiple arrays if needed.",
  "sources": "Reading file paths, checking file extension, loading files with np.load()",
  "sinks": "Returning data for visualization; no external data transmission or system modification",
  "flows": "Input path -> extension check -> np.load() -> stacking arrays -> return layer data",
  "anomalies": "Minimal validation based solely on file extension; no explicit allow_pickle parameter set, potential risk if files are maliciously crafted",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a napari plugin to load .npy files. It filters files by extension, loads data via np.load(), stacks arrays, and returns a list with a single layer. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The primary security concern is the use of np.load() on untrusted files, which could be exploited if files are maliciously crafted, especially if allow_pickle=True (default). However, the code does not specify allow_pickle, defaulting to False in recent numpy versions, mitigating some risk. The validation based solely on extension is minimal but typical for such plugins. Overall, no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected, and the code is benign. The risk is low but non-zero due to potential malicious numpy files, which is a known and accepted risk in data loading routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for loading numpy files into napari. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The potential risk stems from loading untrusted files, but this is inherent to data loaders and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
