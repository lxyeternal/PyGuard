{
  "purpose": "The code provides a basic numpy reader plugin for napari, enabling reading of .npy files and stacking them into a single array for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from file paths, specifically from the filesystem via np.load(_path).",
  "sinks": "Data loading into numpy arrays; no direct sinks like network connections or file modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Path input -> np.load for each file -> array stacking -> output layer data tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Uses standard numpy loading functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward file input handling and data loading with numpy. It reads file paths, filters by extension, loads files as numpy arrays, and stacks them. No external or untrusted data manipulation, no network activity, or secret keys. No suspicious logic or anomalies detected. All functions serve a clear purpose aligned with a data reader plugin. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign numpy reader plugin for napari with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard file I/O operations with no suspicious behavior.",
