{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to define module exports and import specific functions and classes for a Python package related to image annotation and sample data generation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and classes from internal modules (_reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur. No network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly evident; the code only imports and defines an export list without handling data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code, but no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization segment. It imports functions and classes from internal modules and defines an __all__ list to specify exports. Several lines are commented out, indicating potential future or optional exports, but none suggest malicious intent. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The commented code does not indicate any suspicious activity, and the active code performs typical import and export declarations.",
