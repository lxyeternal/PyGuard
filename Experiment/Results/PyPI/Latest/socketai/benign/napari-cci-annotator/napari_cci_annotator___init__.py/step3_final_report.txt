{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing specific functions and classes from internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer). No external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, file writes, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code lines, but these do not execute or pose security issues; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py, importing internal functions/classes and defining __all__. No data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present. Commented lines are benign and suggest optional features. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
