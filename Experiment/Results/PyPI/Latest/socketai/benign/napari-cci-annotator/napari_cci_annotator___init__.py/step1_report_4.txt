{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package for a napari plugin, providing functions and classes related to image annotation and sample data creation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_reader, _sample_data, _widget, _writer) and the assignment of __all__",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code does not include any data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or command execution",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Commented out imports and __all__ entries suggest possible incomplete or intentionally hidden features, but no malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module import and export declaration. It imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. No external input handling, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The commented-out lines indicate possible previous or future features but do not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a plugin package. The commented-out lines do not affect current security posture.",
