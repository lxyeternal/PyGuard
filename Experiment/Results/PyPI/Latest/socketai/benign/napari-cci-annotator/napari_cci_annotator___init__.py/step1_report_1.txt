{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module that imports functions and classes for use elsewhere, likely part of a larger library or application related to data reading, writing, and widget interfaces.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules (._reader, ._sample_data, ._widget, ._writer). No external data input sources or untrusted data input handling is visible.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no network, file, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the module mainly imports and declares export variables.",
  "anomalies": "All import statements are straightforward and standard; the commented-out code does not introduce any suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module setup by importing specific functions and classes. No user input, network operations, or data manipulation is present. The commented lines suggest potential alternative exports but do not execute. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages exports and imports without performing any risky operations.",
