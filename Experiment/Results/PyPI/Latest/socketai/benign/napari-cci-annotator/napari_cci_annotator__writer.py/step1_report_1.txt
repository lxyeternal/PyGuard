{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an example plugin for napari to write image layers to files, implementing the Writer specification.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'path' parameters for file saving, 'data' (layer data), and 'meta' (metadata). These are provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to specified file paths via the return value of write functions. No direct data leakage or network transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (path, data, meta) flow into the write functions; the functions return the file paths of written data. No external or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code, suspicious function calls, or dynamic execution detected. Placeholder comments suggest incomplete implementation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a template for a napari writer plugin, with clearly defined input and output parameters. It lacks implementation logic, meaning it does not perform any processing or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, serving as a scaffold with no hidden or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for a napari writer plugin, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious example with placeholder logic.",
