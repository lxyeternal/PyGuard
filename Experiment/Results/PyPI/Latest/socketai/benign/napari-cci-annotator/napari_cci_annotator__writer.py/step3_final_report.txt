  "purpose": "A scaffold for napari plugin writers to implement image data saving functionality.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'path', 'data', 'meta', and 'data' within 'write_multiple'. No external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "The functions return file paths; no untrusted data is processed or leaked. No sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly to return statements without processing; no data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. Placeholder comments indicate incomplete implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template with placeholder functions for writing images, containing no actual logic or external communication. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The functions simply return input paths, indicating no active processing or security risks. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose as a scaffold.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious template with no security risks or obfuscation. It contains no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities, and the scores should reflect its benign, placeholder status.",
