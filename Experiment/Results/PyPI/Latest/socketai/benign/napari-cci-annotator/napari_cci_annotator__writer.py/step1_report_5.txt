{
  "purpose": "This module provides placeholder functions for writing image data to files in the napari image viewer plugin system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'path', 'data', and 'meta' from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The functions return file path strings, which could potentially be used for file output, but no untrusted data is being directly written or executed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into the functions; the functions then return a list containing the specified path(s). There is no evidence of data being processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a boilerplate template with no actual implementation or logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The module is a simple, skeletal implementation of file-writing functions intended for plugin use. It only accepts and returns data without performing any processing or executing external code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or malicious data handling. The code appears safe and standard for a plugin scaffold.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template with no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified. It serves as a placeholder for user-implemented logic. Overall security risk is very low.",
