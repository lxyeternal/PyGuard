{
  "purpose": "The code is an example template for a napari plugin writer, demonstrating how to implement image writing functions.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data or input; parameters such as 'path', 'data', and 'meta' are passed into functions but are intended for user-defined data and paths.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are the 'path' parameters where files are written; these are used as output destinations. No direct sink of untrusted data to critical system functions is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters ('path', 'data', 'meta') into file-writing operations, but actual implementation details are absent; no untrusted data handling is shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, mostly placeholders for user implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a template with function definitions for writing image data to files, intended for plugin development. It contains no actual file I/O or malicious code. The structure is simple, with clear separation of input parameters and return values. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. It is purely demonstrative and lacks implementation details that could introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign template for a napari writer plugin. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or security risks. The absence of implementation means there are no active security concerns at this stage.",
