{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a template or example for implementing a writer plugin for napari, a Python image viewer.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly read; the code defines functions that accept file paths, data, and metadata as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions receive 'path' parameters where files are written; no data is sent to external networks or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "The functions take parameters (path, data, meta), process them, and return file paths; there are no external data flows or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, mainly defining template functions with placeholder comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, skeletal implementation of a napari plugin writer. It lacks actual file I/O or network operations, containing only placeholder comments where implementation should occur. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities evident. The functions accept parameters but do not process or expose untrusted data or secrets. The structure and content suggest a benign template meant for customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for a napari writer plugin with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, non-obfuscated template that requires implementation details but shows no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
