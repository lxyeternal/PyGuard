  "purpose": "Define file paths and constants for model management in a machine learning application.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No output or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is straightforward and primarily defines static paths and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' but does not utilize it; it only establishes string constants for model directory paths, filenames, and backend labels. There are no dynamic evaluations, user inputs, or network operations. The code appears to be a configuration or setup script for a larger application, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard application initialization code.",
