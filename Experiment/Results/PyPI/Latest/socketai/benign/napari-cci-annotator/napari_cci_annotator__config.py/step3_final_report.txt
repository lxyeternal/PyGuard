  "purpose": "Define static paths and constants for model files and backend identifiers used in a machine learning or inference system.",
  "sources": "Static string concatenations for model and backend paths; import of 'pkg_resources' (unused).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'pkg_resources'; all code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static path definitions and constants for models and backends. There is no dynamic code, external input, or data processing. The import of 'pkg_resources' is unused but not malicious. No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a very low security risk. The minimal risk score assigned in reports (around 0.1) is appropriate but could be lowered to zero, as no security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are justified; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms that this code is safe for use in production or deployment contexts.",
