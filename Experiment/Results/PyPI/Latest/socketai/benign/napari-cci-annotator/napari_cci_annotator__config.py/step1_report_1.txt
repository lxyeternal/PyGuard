  "purpose": "Define file paths and constants for model storage and backend configuration in a machine learning project.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants and string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input, or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. All variables are constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' but does not utilize it, possibly for dependency or version management elsewhere. It primarily sets static file paths and naming conventions for models and backend configurations, which are typical in ML projects. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward configuration code with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It solely defines paths and constants for model files and backend identifiers.",
