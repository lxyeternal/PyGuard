{
  "purpose": "The code defines file paths and constants related to model storage locations and configurations, likely for use in a machine learning application involving model loading and deployment.",
  "sources": "The code sources directory names and filenames for models and related configurations, primarily through string assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, as no input/output functions or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets static string paths and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are observed. All variables are assigned static strings or constants.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes static path and configuration strings for model directories and backend settings. It does not perform any input validation, network communication, or file manipulation beyond string concatenation. No malicious or suspicious operations are evident. The absence of dynamic execution, external inputs, or data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign configuration setup for model file paths and environment settings. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose seems purely to define constants and paths for subsequent use in a larger application.",
