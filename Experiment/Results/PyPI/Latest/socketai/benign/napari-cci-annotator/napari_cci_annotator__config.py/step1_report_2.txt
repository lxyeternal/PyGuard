  "purpose": "Define file paths and constants for model storage and configuration in a machine learning application.",
  "sources": "Constant strings and concatenations for directory and file path definitions.",
  "sinks": "No user input or untrusted data sources present, so no data leaks or injection points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only sets constants and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. Use of standard string concatenations is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static constants for directory paths, filenames, and configuration strings related to models. It employs straightforward string concatenation to set paths for models and OpenVINO model directories. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets constants for model paths and configuration strings. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
