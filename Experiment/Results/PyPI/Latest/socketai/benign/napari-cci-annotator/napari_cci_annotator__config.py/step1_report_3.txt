  "purpose": "Define file paths and configuration constants for model management and backend selection in a machine learning application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all variables are statically assigned string or integer values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static paths and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares string constants and path configurations for models and backend settings. It uses string concatenation for paths and identifiers but does not execute any dynamic or potentially unsafe code. There are no external inputs, no cryptographic operations, and no network communications. It appears to be a straightforward configuration setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration file setting up paths and parameters for machine learning models and compute backends. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
