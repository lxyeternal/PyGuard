{
  "purpose": "Performs a simple HTTP GET request to an external URL and prints the response.",
  "sources": "The URL variable in send_get_request() function; the requests.get() call.",
  "sinks": "The response.text and response.status_code outputs; potential data exfiltration if URL is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input: URL string -> requests.get() -> response -> print response data.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or unusual code patterns; external URL may be suspicious but code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign network request without embedded malicious logic. The URL used is external and potentially used for data collection or exfiltration, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The security concern is primarily about the external URL's purpose, not the code logic. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is moderate (~0.3) due to the external URL's suspicious appearance. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior justify low malware and obfuscation scores, while the external URL warrants cautious review in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no embedded malicious behavior. The external URL's suspicious nature is a concern but does not indicate malicious activity within this code snippet. The scores should reflect the code's inherent safety, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3) due to the external URL.",
