{
  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks in a Python package based on code analysis, identifying malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network calls, eval()/exec() usage, hardcoded secrets, input handling, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, potential data exfiltration, and secret handling.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and inputs flow into eval()/exec() or network calls, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows high suspicion due to dynamic code execution, secret handling, and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent. Absence of code limits certainty, but described patterns justify high malware and obfuscation scores. Low confidence is due to lack of actual code snippets. The reasoning aligns with security best practices, and scores are consistent with the described suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including dynamic code execution, secret handling, and obfuscation, warranting a high malware score (~0.75), obfuscation (~0.7), and security risk (~0.8). Other reports lack such features and are appropriately scored low. Overall, the assessment is justified based on the provided descriptions.",
