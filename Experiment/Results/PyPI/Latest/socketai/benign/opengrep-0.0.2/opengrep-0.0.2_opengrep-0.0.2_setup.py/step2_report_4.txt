  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or network activity is present.\n- The code uses static strings and functions like `find_packages()`, which are typical.\n- Dependencies ('requests', 'twine') are common and benign.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no issues, straightforward setup script.\n- Malware score: 0 — justified.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n- Confidence: 1 — high, given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0 — justified.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning, no issues found.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same consistent conclusion.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, no issues, standard setup.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting no security risks.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with static configuration.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident.\n- Dependencies are standard and benign.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
