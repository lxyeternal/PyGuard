  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and uses common practices.\n- The dependencies ('requests' and 'twine') are typical and benign.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all zero across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no evidence suggesting malicious activity.\n- The use of 'requests' as a dependency is standard and not suspicious.\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code, handle external inputs, or contain obfuscated elements.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk score: 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the absence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in the provided code.",
