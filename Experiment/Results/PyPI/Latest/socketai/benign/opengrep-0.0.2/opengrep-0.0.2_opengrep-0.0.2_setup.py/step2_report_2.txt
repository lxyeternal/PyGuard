  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies.\n- The dependencies ('requests' and 'twine') are common and benign.\n- The reported malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign assessment.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code or handle external inputs.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The package metadata and dependencies are standard and do not raise security concerns.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; no security risks are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup.py script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the analysis above.\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the reports correctly characterize the code as benign.",
