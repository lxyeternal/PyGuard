  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to typical setup.py patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not execute any dynamic code, handle external inputs, or contain obfuscation. Dependencies are common and benign. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No improvements or modifications are necessary.",
