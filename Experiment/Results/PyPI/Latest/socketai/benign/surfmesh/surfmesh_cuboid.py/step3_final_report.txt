  "purpose": "Generate a full cuboid surface mesh using coordinate arrays along each axis, creating quadrilateral faces for all six sides of the cuboid.",
  "sources": "Input coordinate arrays (x_coords, y_coords, z_coords); external functions 'convert_2d_face_to_3d' and 'quad_faces_from_edges'.",
  "sinks": "Output numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 4, 3) representing faces; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Coordinate arrays are validated and converted to 3D points, then passed to external functions to generate faces, which are concatenated into the final mesh.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external threats detected. Input validation is thorough and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric mesh generation with proper validation of input arrays. It relies on external, presumably safe functions for face conversion. No suspicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The validation ensures arrays are 1D, strictly increasing, and of sufficient length. External functions are assumed benign, and the overall logic is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-validated utility for generating cuboid surface meshes with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
