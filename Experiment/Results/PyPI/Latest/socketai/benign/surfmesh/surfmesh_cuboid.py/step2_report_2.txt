  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code generates cuboid meshes from coordinate arrays, with input validation and external helper functions.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The functions used are standard for mesh generation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).  \n  **Justification:** The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The malware score is zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard geometry processing with validation.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious or malicious activity. External functions are assumed safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  **Justification:** The zero malware score is appropriate; the overall risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard mesh generation, validation, and face construction.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or obfuscation. The code uses common numpy operations and helper functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  **Justification:** The code appears benign; the low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard validation and mesh creation.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. All operations are computational and geometric.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, with proper validation and external helper functions.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is straightforward geometry processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  **Justification:** The low risk score is justified given the benign purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concerns, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, just a small concern about potential misuse in a supply chain context, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
