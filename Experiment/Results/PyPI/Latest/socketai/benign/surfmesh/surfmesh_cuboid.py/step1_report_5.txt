{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate surface meshes of cuboids, either based on coordinate arrays or specified dimensions and resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as coordinate arrays, length, width, height, origin, and resolution; also uses imported functions from '.edge' module.",
  "sinks": "Does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data directly; no external network or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and then used to generate coordinate arrays, which are processed through imported functions to produce mesh data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file operations, or obfuscated code present. Validation checks are standard. No unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input arrays for proper shape and increasing order. It computes 3D coordinate grids for the cuboid's faces based on provided dimensions and resolution. It then calls imported functions 'quad_faces_from_edges' and 'convert_2d_face_to_3d' to generate faces of the mesh. No network access, external data handling, or potentially malicious operations are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward geometry mesh generator, with proper input validation and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for generating cuboid surface meshes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears well-structured, with no signs of malware or supply chain attack vectors.",
