{
  "purpose": "The code generates 3D surface meshes of cuboids either from explicit coordinate arrays or based on dimensions, origin, and resolution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: x_coords, y_coords, z_coords arrays; length, width, height, origin, resolution parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code mainly processes data internally and returns mesh arrays. No data is sent over network, written to files, or directly exposed to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate arrays or resolution parameters are processed to generate coordinate points, which are then used to create quadrilateral face meshes. No untrusted data flows to external sinks or systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code performs straightforward geometric computations.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input coordinate arrays for correct shape, size, and increasing order, then generates mesh faces for cuboids. It uses helper functions to convert 2D face data into 3D face meshes. The parameter handling and data processing appear standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. All operations are mathematical and purely computational without external side effects or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign geometric mesh generator for cuboids, with proper input validation and no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It appears safe for use.",
