{
  "purpose": "The code generates 3D surface meshes of cuboids either from explicit coordinate arrays or based on dimensions, resolution, and origin parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads coordinate arrays (x_coords, y_coords, z_coords) and resolution parameters to compute vertex positions and mesh faces.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and concatenates face data into numpy arrays; no untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate arrays or parameters flow into mesh-generating functions, which produce arrays of face vertices for 3D meshes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious file operations, network activity, or obfuscated code. Usage of external functions (convert_2d_face_to_3d, quad_faces_from_edges) appears legitimate and relevant to mesh generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on coordinate arrays and resolution parameters, ensuring they are 1D, strictly increasing, and positive. It generates coordinate grids via numpy.linspace and constructs face meshes by calling external functions to convert 2D face outlines into 3D faces. The mesh is assembled through concatenation of faces for all six sides of a cuboid. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The external functions are assumed to be safe and related to geometry processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating cuboid surface meshes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate geometry processing and input validation, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
