{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate 3D surface meshes of cuboids, either from explicit coordinate arrays or based on specified dimensions and resolution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: x_coords, y_coords, z_coords arrays; length, width, height, origin, resolution parameters; internal functions converting edge arrays to face meshes and mesh grid creation.",
  "sinks": "Return value: numpy.ndarray of face vertices; no direct sinks like network I/O or file operations; internal functions are used for face conversions.",
  "flows": "Input arrays and parameters flow into mesh generation functions; coordinate arrays flow into face conversion functions; final mesh array is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O, no data leakage or privacy violations. The code performs standard geometry mesh generation.",
  "analysis": "The code checks input arrays for shape and increasing order, then uses helper functions to create faces for each side of the cuboid. It computes coordinate arrays with linspace and combines face data into a 3D mesh array. No obfuscated code, no suspicious side effects, and all operations are standard for mesh generation. No external or hidden data access or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard mesh generation utility for cuboids, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on common numerical and geometric operations with no suspicious activities.",
