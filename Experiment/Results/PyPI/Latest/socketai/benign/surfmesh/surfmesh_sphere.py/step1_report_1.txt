  "purpose": "Generate sphere meshes using different methods (projection and radial revolution).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: radius, resolution values, start/end angles; External function calls: cuboid_mesher_with_resolution, circular_revolve.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data effects evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation checks -> mesh generation functions -> external library functions (cuboid_mesher_with_resolution, circular_revolve).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No network activity, file access, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for creating sphere meshes via different methods. It includes input validation for parameters, calls external functions for mesh generation, and normalizes vertices for the projection method. No suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or security risks are present. The external functions are assumed to be safe, as they are typical mesh generation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe for use. It provides mesh generation functionalities with proper input validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware in this code.",
