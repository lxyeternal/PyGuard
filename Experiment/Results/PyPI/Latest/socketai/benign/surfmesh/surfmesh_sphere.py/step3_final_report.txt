{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate sphere meshes via projection and radial methods, utilizing external mesh functions and performing input validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (radius, resolution, angles) and calls external functions 'cuboid_mesher_with_resolution' and 'circular_revolve'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; external functions may process mesh data but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used to generate mesh data through external functions; no untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric mesh generation with proper validation and external dependencies presumed safe. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions are assumed benign; no network or data exfiltration occurs. The code's logic is clear, and scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. External dependencies are assumed secure. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is trustworthy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
