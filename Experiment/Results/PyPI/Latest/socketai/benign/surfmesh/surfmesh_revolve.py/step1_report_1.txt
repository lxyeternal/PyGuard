{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to revolve 2D curves around axes or paths to generate 3D mesh surfaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arrays 'curve' and 'revolve_path' which are provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send untrusted data outside the application or system, nor does it perform network operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed and used internally to generate mesh data; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code mainly performs mathematical transformations and shape generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for 3D surface mesh generation through curve revolution. It validates input shapes, converts inputs to numpy arrays, and performs geometric calculations to produce mesh data. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious external interactions. The operations are standard geometric transformations. No obfuscated code, secret data handling, or network operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of geometric shape generation with proper input validation. It appears safe and free of malicious intent or backdoors. No security risks are identified beyond normal computational processing. The overall risk score is low.",
