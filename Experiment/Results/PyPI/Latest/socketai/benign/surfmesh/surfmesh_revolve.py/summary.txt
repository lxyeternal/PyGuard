  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geometric mesh generation functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the computational nature without external dependencies or malicious payloads."
