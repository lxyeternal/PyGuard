{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate 3D meshes by revolving 2D curves either along arbitrary paths or around the Z-axis, primarily for geometric modeling and visualization.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'curve' and 'revolve_path' provided by the user, read via numpy.asarray conversions and parameter inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the code performs in-memory computations only, with no network, file I/O, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through validation and transformation steps into mesh vertex arrays via numpy operations, with no external or untrusted data influencing control flow beyond input validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with standard mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input shapes, converts inputs to numpy arrays, and performs geometric calculations to produce mesh vertices. No external interactions or malicious constructs are detected. The functions are standard for mesh generation, with proper validation and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geometric mesh generation functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the computational nature without external dependencies or malicious payloads.",
