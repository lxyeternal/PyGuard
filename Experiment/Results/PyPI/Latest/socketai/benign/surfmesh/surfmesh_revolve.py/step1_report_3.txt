{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate 3D mesh surfaces by revolving 2D curves around an axis or along a specified path, primarily for geometric modeling and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the parameters 'curve' and 'revolve_path', which are arrays representing geometric coordinates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities are present; the code performs geometric calculations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (curve, revolve_path) through processing steps (array conversions, shape checks, mathematical transformations) without any untrusted external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code employs standard mathematical and array operations. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation on input shapes, converts inputs to numpy arrays, and constructs 3D mesh data using mathematical transformations. The functions rely on numpy for calculations and do not execute external commands or handle untrusted external data sources. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of numpy for geometric modeling is typical and does not involve security risks. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious code constructs, nor does it manipulate or access sensitive system information.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard geometric modeling code with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It solely performs mathematical computations for 3D surface generation. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
