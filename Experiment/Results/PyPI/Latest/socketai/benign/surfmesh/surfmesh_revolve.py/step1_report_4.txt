{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate 3D meshes by revolving 2D curves along specified paths, either along arbitrary paths or around the Z-axis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input arrays 'curve' and 'revolve_path' via parameters, and generates mesh data without external untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "The functions output 3D mesh arrays. There are no sinks involving network, file operations, or other data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through computations and transformations into the output mesh arrays. No untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; the code performs straightforward geometric computations.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input shapes, performs mathematical operations to generate 3D meshes, and uses numpy for array manipulations. It does not contain any code that could be considered malicious such as data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors. There are no external network calls or file I/O operations. The code strictly deals with mathematical geometry generation and visualization purposes. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometry processing script for 3D mesh generation via revolution techniques. It appears to be a benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use within its intended scope.",
