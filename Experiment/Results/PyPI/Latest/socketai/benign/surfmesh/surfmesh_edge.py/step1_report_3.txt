  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating and manipulating 2D and 3D mesh geometries, including converting 2D faces to 3D, generating quadrilaterals from edge coordinates, interpolating between edges to form meshes, and creating rectangle perimeters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'quad_2d_mesh', 'u_coords', 'v_coords', 'edges', 'length_edge', and 'width_edge'. It also reads data from 'np.ndarray' inputs and array-like structures, performing data manipulations and interpolations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks that could lead to data leaks, system commands, network activity, or other side effects. No outputs directly cause system modifications or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations and array manipulations within functions, primarily for geometric data processing. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks such as network or file I/O are present that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward geometric utility functions without obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic. It performs standard array operations, mesh generation, and geometric computations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions for mesh and geometry generation, all written in clear Python using numpy. It includes input validation, standard array manipulations, and geometric computations. No signs of malicious payloads, system command execution, or external network communication are present. The functions are intended for mesh generation and manipulation, and do not perform any side effects beyond data processing. The code is well-structured, with clear parameter validation and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of geometric utility functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The overall security risk is very low, primarily serving geometric mesh computations. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies that would suggest compromise.",
