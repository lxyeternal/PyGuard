  "purpose": "Generate 3D mesh models of cylinders with configurable caps and lateral surfaces, supporting different cap styles and resolutions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters for radius, height, and resolution; external functions for disk meshing, face conversion, and revolution operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code outputs mesh arrays based on validated inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation → external mesh functions → face conversion → revolution → stacking meshes → output array.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; external functions assumed safe; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric mesh generation for cylinders, with proper input validation and clear logic. It relies on external, presumably safe, functions for meshing and transformation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The external functions are assumed to be standard geometry routines, and the data flow is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured 3D mesh generator for cylinders with different cap styles. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
