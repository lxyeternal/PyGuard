  "purpose": "Generate 3D mesh models of cylinders with different cap geometries for use in 3D modeling or simulation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (radius, height, resolutions), imported functions from local modules (disk_mesher_radial, disk_mesher_square_centered, convert_2d_face_to_3d, circular_revolve).",
  "sinks": "Return value (mesh arrays), no external data sinks or untrusted input outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to generate disk meshes, which are transformed into 3D meshes and combined via stacking. No data flows from external sources to critical sinks outside function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to generate cylinder meshes with different cap geometries. It validates input parameters for positivity and minimum values, then calls external, presumably trusted, functions for disk mesh creation and 3D transformation. The mesh data is generated through straightforward geometric calculations and concatenated via np.vstack. There are no signs of data leakage, external network activity, or malicious code. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear input validation and logical flow. The code appears to be legitimate geometric mesh generation code, with no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of cylinder mesh generation functions for 3D modeling purposes. It performs input validation, calls trusted external functions, and assembles mesh data securely. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
