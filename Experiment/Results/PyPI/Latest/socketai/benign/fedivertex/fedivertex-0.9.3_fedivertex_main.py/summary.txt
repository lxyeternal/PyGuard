  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data loader and graph constructor with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is reliance on an external dataset source, which appears trustworthy. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the static dataset URL and standard data processing."
