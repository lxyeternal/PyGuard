  "purpose": "Retrieve package version and set metadata variables for the package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"fedivertex\") call for version info, and local import of GraphLoader from .main.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; only package metadata setup.",
  "flows": "Importing version info from package metadata (source) to __version__ variable (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward standard package initialization code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a local import and retrieves package version info using standard library functions. It assigns version and license info to module variables. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clear, readable, and typical for package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
