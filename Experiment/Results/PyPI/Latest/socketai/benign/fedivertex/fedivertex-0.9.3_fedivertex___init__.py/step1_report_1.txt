  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard package metadata access, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'GraphLoader' from a local module and retrieves the version of the package using importlib.metadata, assigning it to __version__. It also sets a license string. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or other suspicious behavior present. The code appears to be straightforward package metadata setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata with no suspicious or malicious activities.",
