{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata including version and license, and imports a class from a local module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'GraphLoader' from the local module '.main', calling 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' to get package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no external network, file, or system modification operations present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the package version and assigns it to '__version__'; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomaly; the code performs standard package metadata initialization. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, retrieves the package version via 'importlib.metadata.version', and sets license info. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are processed. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to be standard package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward, non-malicious package metadata definition with no security concerns or suspicious activity.",
