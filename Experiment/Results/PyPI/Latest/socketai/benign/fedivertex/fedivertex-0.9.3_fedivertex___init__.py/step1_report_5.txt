{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class and retrieves the package version, likely for use in package initialization or metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function call, which reads the package version from the installed distribution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "The version function reads package metadata, which is a benign source; no data flows to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, then retrieves the package's version number using importlib.metadata. This is a standard practice for versioning metadata. No untrusted input, malicious code, or malicious behavior is evident. The license declaration is also standard. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard metadata retrieval and import operations without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
