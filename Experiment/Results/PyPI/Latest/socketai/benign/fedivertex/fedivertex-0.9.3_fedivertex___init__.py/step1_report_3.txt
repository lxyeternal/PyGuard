  "purpose": "Define package version and license information, and import a class from a local module.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version retrieves package version; relative import from .main module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or external effects evident.",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version flows from importlib.metadata to __version__; local import does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class GraphLoader from a local module, retrieves the package version using standard library, and sets license info. No external data handling, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent detected. The use of importlib.metadata.version is standard for version retrieval, and the rest of the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic package metadata setup with standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present.",
