{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'GraphLoader' from a local module and retrieves the package version, setting it to __version__, along with defining a license string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version and imports a local module component.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external outputs or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; the only flow involves assigning the package version string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The license string is a standard declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and sets metadata variables. It uses importlib.metadata to retrieve the version of the package 'fedivertex', which is standard practice. The imported class 'GraphLoader' is imported from a local module, and there are no dynamic code executions or suspicious behaviors. The license declaration is typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata and import statement setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger package's initialization or setup script. No malicious behaviors or security risks are identified.",
