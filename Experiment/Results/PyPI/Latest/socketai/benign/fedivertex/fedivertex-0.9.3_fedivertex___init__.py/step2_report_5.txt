  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is extremely simple: it imports a class from a local module and retrieves the package version via `importlib.metadata.version`.\n- No external data flows, no user input, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The license string is a standard declaration.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's `__init__.py` or setup script.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n### Issue Presence\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious code.\n- The only operations are importing a class and retrieving package metadata, which are standard practices.\n- No anomalies, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no external data processing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and standard.\n- No flaws or mistakes in reasoning are evident; the analysis correctly dismisses any suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification\n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The confidence score is 1, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Risk Scores\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, the scores should remain at 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n- The reports assume that retrieving package version and importing a local class is benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Security risk score:** **0** (no vulnerabilities or risky operations)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe code is a standard package metadata setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.",
