  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, performing standard imports and metadata setup.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.version` is a common, benign way to retrieve package version info.\n- The imported class `GraphLoader` from a local module is not suspicious on its own; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code matches the description.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no external influence.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard package metadata setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, standard package metadata setup with no security concerns.",
