  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing a local class and retrieving the package version using `importlib.metadata.version`.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard package metadata setup, likely part of an `__init__.py` or similar module.\n\n**Confirming the code's behavior:**\n\n- The code imports `GraphLoader` from a local module `.main`. This is a relative import, typical in package code.\n- It retrieves the package version with `version(\"fedivertex\")`, which is standard for accessing installed package metadata.\n- It assigns the version to `__version__` and sets a license string.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- No external data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The license string is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is 1, which seems justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n\n- There are no issues present; the code is benign.\n- The logic and reasoning in all reports are sound and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, harmless setup for package metadata.\n- The reported scores are reasonable and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
