  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging a project named 'fedivertex'. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and reads a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reads the local file 'README.md' for long_description; imports from 'setuptools' and 'pathlib'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and static metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. There is no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or malicious behavior. Dependencies are common packages. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with safe, standard packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python packaging configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
