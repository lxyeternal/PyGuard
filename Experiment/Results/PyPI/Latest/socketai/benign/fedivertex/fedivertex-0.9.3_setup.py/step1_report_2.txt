  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'fedivertex' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description; dependencies are specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the script does not process untrusted input or perform network or system actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency declarations are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, reads a local README file, and defines package metadata and dependencies. It does not include any dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations. All dependencies are explicitly listed, and no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup configuration for packaging a project. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and standard in practice.",
