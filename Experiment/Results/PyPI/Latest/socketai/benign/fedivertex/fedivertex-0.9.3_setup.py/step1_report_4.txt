  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the fedivertex Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine the current directory, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is transmitted or executed based on external input.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; the script solely prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is standard setup.py boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and requirements. It reads the README.md file for a long description. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, or handling of untrusted data is observed. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
