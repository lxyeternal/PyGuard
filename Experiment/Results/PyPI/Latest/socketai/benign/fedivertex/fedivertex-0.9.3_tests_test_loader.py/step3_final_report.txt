{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the GraphLoader class, verifying data loading, graph construction, and data integrity using static datasets and internal methods.",
  "sources": "Internal dataset files, method calls within the code, configuration data, and static variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset files and internal method outputs to assertions; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, well-structured testing code that interacts solely with local datasets and internal methods. No network activity, external inputs, or malicious code are present. The dataset access is standard for testing purposes and does not pose security risks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It operates only on local datasets and internal methods, making the security risk negligible.",
