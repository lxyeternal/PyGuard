  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of potentially malicious behavior in reports 1 and 2, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting caution. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) are correctly scored with minimal risk. The overall malware risk is estimated at approximately 0.65, obfuscation at 0.75, and security risk at 0.7, reflecting the suspicion levels. No code indicates confirmed malicious activity, but the features suggest a moderate to high threat potential requiring further analysis before deployment."
