  "purpose": "Analyze the open-source dependency for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks, focusing on code features such as eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and dynamic imports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, dynamic import statements, eval/exec calls, network or file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, network data) flow into eval/exec, dynamic imports, or data processing functions, potentially leading to network transmission, file writing, or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code, hardcoded IPs/credentials, dynamic import statements, reflection, decoding routines, suspicious network activity, or absence of code.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits common malicious indicators such as eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, which suggest potential malicious intent. Reports 1 and 2 describe these features explicitly, justifying high malware scores (~0.6) and obfuscation scores (~0.75). Reports 3, 4, and 5 lack suspicious features, with scores near zero. The overall suspicion is primarily driven by the features in reports 1 and 2, which warrant further investigation. The scores are consistent with the described features and typical threat models.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of potentially malicious behavior in reports 1 and 2, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting caution. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) are correctly scored with minimal risk. The overall malware risk is estimated at approximately 0.65, obfuscation at 0.75, and security risk at 0.7, reflecting the suspicion levels. No code indicates confirmed malicious activity, but the features suggest a moderate to high threat potential requiring further analysis before deployment.",
