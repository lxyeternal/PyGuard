  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration for 'byted_overpass_cmp_ecom_product_backend'.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads data from a file ('README.md') during setup, no untrusted data flow to other parts of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It reads a long description from a local file, specifies package metadata, and does not include any network operations, data processing, or code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of package configuration. The only potential concern is reading a local file, but that is standard in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign package description file.",
