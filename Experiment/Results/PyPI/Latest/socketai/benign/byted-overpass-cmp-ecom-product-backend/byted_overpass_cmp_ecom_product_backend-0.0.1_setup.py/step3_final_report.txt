  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and reading README.md for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows",
  "flows": "None; static metadata assignment without dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without exception handling, but common in setup scripts and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static package metadata, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing. It reads a local README file, which is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The use of open() without exception handling is typical in such scripts and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores set to 0.",
