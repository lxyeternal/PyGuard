  "purpose": "This code defines a simple function that adds one to a given number, serving as a basic utility or example.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, no network or file operations, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or malicious intent are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further analysis or score adjustments are necessary.",
