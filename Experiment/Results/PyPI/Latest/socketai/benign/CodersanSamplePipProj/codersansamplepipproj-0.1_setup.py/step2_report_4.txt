  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code. No untrusted data sources or sinks are present. The URLs and email are public metadata.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static strings. The only minor concern is the email domain 'yhaoo.com' which appears to be a typo, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, noting the typo in email domain but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, with a note on the email typo but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code being a straightforward setup script with no malicious code, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is plain and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is a typical, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
