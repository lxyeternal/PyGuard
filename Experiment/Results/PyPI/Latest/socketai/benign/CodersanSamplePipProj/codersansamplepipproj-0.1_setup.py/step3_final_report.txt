  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings in setup() parameters: name, author, email, url, download_url, keywords, dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data processing occurs during execution.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in email domain 'yhaoo.com' instead of 'yahoo.com', but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup configuration with no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only minor anomaly is the email typo, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minor typo in the email domain does not affect security. The code poses no supply chain security risk.",
