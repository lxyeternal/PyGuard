  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a straightforward import statement.\n- No code execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears standard and benign in all reports.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning a 0.1, likely reflecting a very cautious stance but not necessarily indicating real risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified given the simplicity.\n- **Issue:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correct; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Issue:** None.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; benign import.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Issue:** None.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Analysis:** Slightly more cautious, assigning confidence 0.9 and a small security risk score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's simplicity, these scores seem overly cautious. The minimal code does not justify a security risk of 0.1.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, as there's no evidence of risk or malicious intent.\n- **Note:** The reasoning is correct that the code is benign, but the assigned scores are slightly inflated.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Issue:** None.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & My Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1; I agree with the overall assessment that the code is benign, and the small risk score is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only minor point is the securityRisk score in report 4, which should be lowered from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the other assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk in this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports largely agree. The scores should reflect the absence of risk and malicious behavior, which they do, except for a slight overestimation in report 4's securityRisk score.",
