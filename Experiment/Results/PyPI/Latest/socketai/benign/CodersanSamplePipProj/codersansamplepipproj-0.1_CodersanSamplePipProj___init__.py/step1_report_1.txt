  "purpose": "Import the function 'add_one' from the module 'example' within the 'CodersanSamplePipProj' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package 'CodersanSamplePipProj' and the submodule 'example' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a single import statement with no additional logic, making it unlikely to contain anomalies or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a straightforward import of a function 'add_one' from a specified package module. There are no data manipulations, input handling, or network operations. The import itself is typical in Python and does not suggest malicious intent. Given the minimal code, there is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not pose any threat in its current form.",
