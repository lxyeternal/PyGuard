  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a general utility or application script, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively without examining actual code content.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, or potentially from external libraries if used, but specifics are not provided in the prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or external process calls, but no explicit actions are detailed in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit code, no source-to-sink data flow can be definitively traced.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident from the prompt. Cannot assess further without code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code details are provided to analyze data sources, sinks, or specific behaviors. The analysis relies on the assumption that the code is either standard or lacks overt malicious patterns. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are observable from the given prompt.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of specific code content, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears benign or incomplete. Further analysis would require the actual code snippet.",
