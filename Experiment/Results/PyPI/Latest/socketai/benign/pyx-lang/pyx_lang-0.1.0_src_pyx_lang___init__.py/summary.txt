  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the modest security risk scores reflect cautious optimism. If dynamic code execution functions like eval/exec are confirmed, consider increasing malware risk accordingly. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate given the limited data."
