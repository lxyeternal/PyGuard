  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are well-reasoned; the suspicion levels in Reports 1 and 2 are justified given obfuscation and dynamic features. Scores are appropriate but should be refined upon further code review. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but caution is advised for Reports 1 and 2. The remaining reports pose minimal or no risk."
