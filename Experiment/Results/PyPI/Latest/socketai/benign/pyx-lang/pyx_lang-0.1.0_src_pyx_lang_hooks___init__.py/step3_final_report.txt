  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, environment/user input, network/file operations, dynamic code execution functions, hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "File system, network connections, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from sources to sinks via data processing, possibly through dynamic execution or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.7), minimal comments, suspicion of dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, lack of concrete code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 2 identify obfuscation and dynamic behavior as suspicious, with scores reflecting moderate to high concern. Lack of concrete code snippets limits definitive conclusions; scores are conservative but appropriate. Reports 3, 4, and 5 show no code or benign code, with scores aligned to their content. The suspicion in Reports 1 and 2 warrants further static and dynamic analysis to confirm or refute malicious intent. The current scores are consistent with the described features, but slight adjustments could be made if code evidence confirms malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are well-reasoned; the suspicion levels in Reports 1 and 2 are justified given obfuscation and dynamic features. Scores are appropriate but should be refined upon further code review. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but caution is advised for Reports 1 and 2. The remaining reports pose minimal or no risk.",
