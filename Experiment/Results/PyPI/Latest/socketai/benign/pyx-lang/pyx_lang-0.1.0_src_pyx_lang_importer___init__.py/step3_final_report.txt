  "sinks": "Potential execution during import of pyx_importer, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Code imports pyx_importer -> inserts pyx_importer into sys.meta_path -> import system invokes pyx_importer during module import.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an import hook for .pyx files by inserting a third-party importer into sys.meta_path, guarded by a global flag to prevent multiple insertions. It relies on an external module, which could execute arbitrary code during import, but the code itself is benign and standard. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'pyx_importer'. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent. The risk score should be low, reflecting external dependency risk, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for a custom import hook with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the external 'pyx_importer', but the code snippet itself is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to reliance on external code.",
