{
  "purpose": "The code installs a custom import hook for importing pyx files by modifying the sys.meta_path.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'meta_path' from sys and imports 'pyx_importer' from a third-party module.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.meta_path, which influences module import behavior; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports pyx_importer and inserts it into sys.meta_path if not already installed, affecting import system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Uses a straightforward import hook installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to insert a custom importer (pyx_importer) into the import system via sys.meta_path. It uses a global flag to prevent multiple insertions. The import of 'pyx_importer' is from a third-party package. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is standard for implementing custom import hooks. No obfuscation, no suspicious code flow. The code relies on external 'pyx_importer' but does not itself perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of an import hook setup for pyx files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
