  "purpose": "A minimal Python script defining a main() function that prints a static message, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that prints a static message. All reports agree that it is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No external dependencies, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present. The high confidence scores (1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code. There are no anomalies or indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary; the code can be considered safe and non-malicious.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
