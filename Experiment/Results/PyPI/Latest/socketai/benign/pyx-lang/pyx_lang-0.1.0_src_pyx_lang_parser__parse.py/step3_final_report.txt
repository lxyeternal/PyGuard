{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Python parser framework that loads grammar definitions from resource files based on version info, and sets up tokenization and parsing classes for processing Python source code.",
  "sources": "Resource files read via read_text for grammar definitions, input source code passed to parse function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or dangerous data flows; no code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Source: input source code; sink: parser processing; flow is straightforward without untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code structure is standard for parser setup.",
  "analysis": "The code loads grammar definitions dynamically based on version info, initializes custom parser classes, and defines token classes. It does not perform any malicious actions, network operations, or code injection. The reliance on external resource files could be a supply chain concern if those files are compromised, but this is typical for parser implementations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal supply chain risk rather than active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard parser setup with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities evident. The supply chain risk is minimal and related to external resource integrity, not code maliciousness. The assigned scores are consistent and appropriate.",
