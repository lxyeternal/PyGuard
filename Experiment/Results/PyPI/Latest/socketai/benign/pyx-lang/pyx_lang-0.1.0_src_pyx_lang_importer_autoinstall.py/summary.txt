  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and straightforward, with the main security concern being the behavior of the 'install()' function. Without evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should be zero, and the security risk remains moderate due to the automatic modification of import behavior. Further review of 'install()' is recommended before trusting or deploying this code in sensitive environments."
