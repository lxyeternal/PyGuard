  "purpose": "Define module exports and import core functions for tokenization, parsing, and compilation.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules: .tokenizer.tokenize, ._parse, .compiler.compile",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, user input, or external communication present",
  "flows": "None; the code only sets up exports and imports functions",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static import/export with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module interface that declares an __all__ list and imports three functions from internal modules. There are no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature. The only minor discrepancy is a report assigning a risk score of 0.1, which appears to be an overly cautious default, but given the code's benign content, this is acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module interface with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security and obfuscation scores are accurate. The minimal risk score is justified, and overall, the code poses no security concerns.",
