  "purpose": "Module exports for tokenizer, parser, and compiler functions of a larger project.",

  "sinks": "Potentially, usage of imported functions if called with untrusted input elsewhere in the project.",
  "flows": "Not applicable here, as this code only performs static imports and exports without executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated elements. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exported list of functions and imports them from relative modules. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security issues. The code is simple, standard Python module setup with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file, exposing functions for use elsewhere. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
