{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a Python package/module by listing exported functions and importing them from submodules.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .tokenizer.tokenize, ._parse, and .compiler.compile",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions; the code only imports functions and defines exports",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from source to sink, as the code only imports and exports functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code specifies a list of publicly accessible functions and imports them from internal modules. There are no functions with logic, no input handling, no output, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module __all__ definition. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple module interface declaration, importing functions from submodules and exposing them. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
