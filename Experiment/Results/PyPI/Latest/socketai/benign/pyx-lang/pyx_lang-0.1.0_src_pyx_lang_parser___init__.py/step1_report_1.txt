{
  "purpose": "To expose functions for tokenization, parsing, and compilation within a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from local modules: .tokenizer.tokenize, ._parse, .compiler.compile",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or code execution",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions and defines an export list without processing data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ list to specify exported functions. It imports three functions from local modules, likely part of a compiler or interpreter package. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network communication present. The import statements and export list are straightforward, indicating standard modular Python code. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears to serve as an interface or entry point for a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition that exports functions for tokenization, parsing, and compilation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
