  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines an `__all__` list, imports three functions from local modules, and appears to be a straightforward module interface.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues or risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with standard imports and exports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Error:** JSON parse error in the raw response, but the embedded analysis and scores are clear.\n- **Summary:** Same as previous reports, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Discussion:** The security risk score is set to 0.1, which is very low, but slightly above zero. Given the code's simplicity, this might be a conservative default or an artifact of the reporting system. Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present, this small increase seems unwarranted.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score should be 0, aligning with the rest of the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard module export pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Almost all are 0, except Report 3's 0.1, which appears unjustified given the code snippet.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 3's securityRisk score from 0.1 to 0.** The code is standard, with no evident vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n- **Overall Malware and Obfuscated scores are accurate at 0.** The code is clean and transparent.\n\n### Estimated scores based on the entire analysis:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (after correction)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a minimal, standard module interface with no security concerns.",
