  "purpose": "Exporting functions tokenize, parse, and compile_to_ast for external use from a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from internal modules (.tokenizer.tokenize, ._parse, .compiler.compile).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions and then exports them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated code. The structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. It then imports three functions from internal modules. The imports are standard, and no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal, primarily for module interface definition, with no embedded malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a module export interface with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, with no anomalies or malware signals.",
