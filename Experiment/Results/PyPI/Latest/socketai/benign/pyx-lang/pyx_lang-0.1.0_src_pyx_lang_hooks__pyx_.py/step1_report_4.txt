  "purpose": "The function is designed to generate a string representation of an HTML element with specified tag, contents, and attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'tag', 'contents', and '**kwargs' (additional keyword arguments).",
  "sinks": "Return statement constructing a formatted string; no external data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in the formatted string to produce output; no data flow leading to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of f-string with named expressions (e.g., {tag=}) which is a Python 3.8+ feature. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that returns a string describing its input parameters using Python 3.8+ syntax. It does not perform any file operations, network calls, or execute untrusted code. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of self-documenting f-string syntax is normal and harmless. Overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This function is a straightforward utility for formatting element data; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
