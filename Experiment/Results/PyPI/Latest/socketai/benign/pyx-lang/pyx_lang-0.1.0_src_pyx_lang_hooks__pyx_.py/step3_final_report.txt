  "purpose": "A utility function to create a string representation of an HTML/XML element with optional contents and attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'tag', 'contents', and keyword arguments (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into string formatting via f-string; no external or untrusted data processed beyond formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 3.8+ debug f-string syntax ('=') is benign; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function performs straightforward string formatting of its inputs, with no code execution, network activity, or data leaks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The use of repr for 'contents' and debug syntax in f-string is safe. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility function with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports accurately reflect its benign nature. The overall assessment should assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
