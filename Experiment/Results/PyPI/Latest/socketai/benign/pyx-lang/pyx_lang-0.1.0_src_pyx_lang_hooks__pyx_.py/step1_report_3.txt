{
  "purpose": "The function constructs a string representation of an HTML element with specified tag, contents, and additional attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'tag', 'contents', and 'kwargs' (additional keyword arguments).",
  "sinks": "Return statement generating a formatted string; no direct data leak or external effect.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are incorporated into the string; no data flow to external systems or sinks beyond return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of f-string with inline evaluation of variables; no apparent malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. The code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that formats HTML element information into a string. There are no inputs that execute commands, no data transmitted externally, and no security-sensitive operations. The use of f-string with inline variable display ('tag=', 'contents=', 'kwargs=') is benign and likely intended for debugging or representation. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for string formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The function is simple, safe, and not suspicious.",
