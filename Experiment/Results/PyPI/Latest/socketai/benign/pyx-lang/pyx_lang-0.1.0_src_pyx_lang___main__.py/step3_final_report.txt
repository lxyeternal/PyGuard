  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point that imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import main' and subsequent call 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which could potentially contain malicious code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to execution of 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this snippet; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python entry point pattern, importing 'main' from a local module and executing it. The behavior and security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()', which is not provided. The snippet itself is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting the minimal and standard nature of the code. Confidence is high that there is no malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python entry point with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. Further analysis of the 'main()' function is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
