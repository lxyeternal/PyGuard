{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module, likely to run a script or application entry point.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import main is the source of code execution, bringing in the 'main' function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Calling main() executes code that may contain any number of operations; potential sinks depend on the implementation of 'main', which is not provided.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'main' in the current module to executing main(), which then runs the code defined in the 'main' function of the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports and runs the main() function from a local module. Without the implementation details of 'main', it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The code structure itself is typical for a Python script's entry point, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no indications of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears to be a standard entry point that delegates execution to a main function defined elsewhere.",
