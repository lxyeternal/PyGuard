{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'main' function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' executes the imported function, potentially executing arbitrary code within that function.",
  "flows": "Code loads the 'main' function from the local module and executes it directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple entry point that imports and runs the 'main' function from a local module. Without examining the content of 'main', it is impossible to determine the behavior of that function. The code itself contains no malicious logic or suspicious patterns. It appears to be standard practice for Python scripts to execute a main function as an entry point.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve as an entry point for a larger application. Its security risk is low, assuming the 'main' module is safe.",
