{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'main' function from a module named 'main' within the same package and executes it.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import main",
  "sinks": "The call to main() function",
  "flows": "Import statement -> execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no apparent hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a straightforward import and invocation of a main function from a local module. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, no manipulation of environment variables, and no embedded or obfuscated code. Without inspecting the 'main' function's implementation, this snippet alone does not reveal malicious behavior. Its simplicity suggests typical package structure usage.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for executing code in a modular Python program.",
