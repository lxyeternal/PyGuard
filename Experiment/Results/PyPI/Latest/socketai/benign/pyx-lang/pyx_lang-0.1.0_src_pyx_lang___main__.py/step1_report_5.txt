{
  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.main' and its 'main' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'main()' function, which could perform any operations defined within.",
  "flows": "Import from .main -> execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, simply calling main() after import. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'main' function from a relative module '.main' and executes it immediately. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns. Since the content of 'main' is unknown, we cannot assess its internal behavior; however, based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, minimal, and follows typical Python module usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply imports and runs a main() function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. Without further context on 'main', no malicious activity can be inferred.",
