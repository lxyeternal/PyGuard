{
  "purpose": "This module sets up a FastMCP server for Redshift utility operations, including configuration validation and handler registration.",
  "sources": "get_data_api_config() function called during server startup to retrieve configuration from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily reads environment configs and sets up handlers.",
  "flows": "The configuration retrieval flow: get_data_api_config() is called during server startup to validate environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behaviors, and no obfuscated or unusual code segments are present. The code performs expected initialization and validation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and internal modules to initialize a server, validates Redshift Data API configuration during startup, and registers multiple handler modules. The validation occurs via get_data_api_config(), which presumably reads environment variables. The server lifespan management is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external untrusted data flows. The rest of the code involves standard server setup, handler registration, and logging, all of which are normal and benign activities.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It performs typical server initialization with configuration validation and handler registration. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
