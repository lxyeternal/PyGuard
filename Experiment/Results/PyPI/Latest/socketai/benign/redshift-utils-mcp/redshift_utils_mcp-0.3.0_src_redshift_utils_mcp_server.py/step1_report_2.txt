{
  "purpose": "Initialize and configure the FastMCP server for Redshift Data API diagnostics and management, including validation of configuration during startup.",
  "sources": "get_data_api_config() function, which reads environment variables or configuration for AWS Redshift Data API.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no evident data leak or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The server lifespan function calls get_data_api_config() as a source; it raises errors if configuration is invalid, preventing server startup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a server with proper logging and validation routines. The only data source appears to be configuration data retrieved via get_data_api_config(). This function is expected to access environment variables or config files; it is called during server startup to validate AWS Redshift Data API configuration. There are no other input sources, no user input handling, and no data leakage mechanisms. The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. It also does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic; it appears to be standard setup code for a service, with proper error handling and logging. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server initialization script with configuration validation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup for a Redshift utility server.",
