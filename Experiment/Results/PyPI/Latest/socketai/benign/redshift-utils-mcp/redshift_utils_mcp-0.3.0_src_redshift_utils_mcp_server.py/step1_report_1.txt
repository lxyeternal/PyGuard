{
  "purpose": "This module sets up and initializes a FastMCP server for Redshift utility tools, handling server startup validation and registering various tool, resource, and prompt handlers.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment configurations via get_data_api_config(), imports from local modules, and possibly receives external inputs via environment variables during get_data_api_config().",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs (logger), environment variables via get_data_api_config(), and server startup procedures.",
  "flows": "get_data_api_config() reads configuration data; if invalid, it raises DataApiConfigError which triggers an error log and prevents server startup. Registered handlers are initialized but do not process untrusted input in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Logging levels are standard; environment variable access occurs within get_data_api_config(), which is a typical configuration validation step.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs server setup and configuration validation. It imports standard libraries, configures logging, defines an async context manager for server lifespan which validates configuration via get_data_api_config(), and initializes a server instance with registered handlers. No untrusted input processing or network communication is visible here. The configuration validation depends on environment variables, which is standard practice. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical server setup script with configuration validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. It appears to be a legitimate component for a Redshift utility server setup.",
