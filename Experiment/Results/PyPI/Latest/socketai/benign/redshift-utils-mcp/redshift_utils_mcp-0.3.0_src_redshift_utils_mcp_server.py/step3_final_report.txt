  "purpose": "Initializes a FastMCP server for Redshift utilities, performing configuration validation via environment variables and registering handlers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed within get_data_api_config() during startup validation.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs; no data exfiltration or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration validation occurs at startup; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server setup that validates configuration via get_data_api_config(), which likely reads environment variables. It performs standard logging, error handling, and handler registration. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The reliance on environment variables is typical for configuration management; assuming proper handling, it does not introduce security risks. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or untrusted input processing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard server initialization routine with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal security risk pertains to environment variable handling, which is common and not inherently insecure. Overall, no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
