  "purpose": "Initialize and configure a FastMCP server for Redshift utilities, including server lifespan management and handler registration.",
  "sources": "get_data_api_config() function call within server_lifespan; environment variables accessed indirectly via this function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure data handling if get_data_api_config() retrieves sensitive info from environment variables; no direct data leaks or malicious actions detected in this code.",
  "flows": "server_lifespan calls get_data_api_config() during startup; logs success or failure based on configuration validation; no data flows beyond configuration validation in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard logging and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with configuration validation via get_data_api_config(), which likely reads environment variables for AWS Redshift Data API credentials or settings. The use of try-except for configuration validation and logging is standard. No suspicious code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Handler functions are imported but not shown, and their behavior cannot be assessed here. No embedded or obfuscated malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server initialization script with configuration validation. No malicious intent or malicious code detected. It performs expected setup and validation tasks without any suspicious activities.",
