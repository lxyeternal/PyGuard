{
  "purpose": "Initialize and configure a FastMCP server for Redshift utility management, including validation of AWS Redshift Data API configuration and registration of various handlers.",
  "sources": "get_data_api_config() function call in server_lifespan for configuration validation; environment variables or external configs accessed within get_data_api_config.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or misuse could occur if configuration data (e.g., credentials or sensitive info) retrieved by get_data_api_config is mishandled or exposed. No explicit untrusted input sources or data sinks evident in this code.",
  "flows": "During server startup, get_data_api_config() is called, which may access environment variables or configs; flow terminates with exception if invalid. No other data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code performs standard server setup and validation without suspicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a FastMCP server instance, configures logging, and defines a server lifespan context manager for configuration validation. The get_data_api_config() function's details are external, but likely retrieves configuration from environment variables or external files. No user input handling, network operations, or data exfiltration code detected. All operations appear to be standard initialization and registration routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server setup script with configuration validation. No malicious or suspicious behaviors identified. It relies on external configuration validation function without exposing sensitive data or executing harmful operations.",
