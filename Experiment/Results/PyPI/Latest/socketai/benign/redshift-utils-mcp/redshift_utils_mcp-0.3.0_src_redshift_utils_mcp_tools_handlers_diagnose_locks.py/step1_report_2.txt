{
  "purpose": "The code handles diagnosing lock contention by querying lock information from a database and filtering results based on optional parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads SQL script from 'locks/blocking_pids.sql', configuration data via 'get_data_api_config()', and executes SQL queries through 'execute_sql()'. It also reads input parameters 'target_pid', 'target_table_name', and 'min_wait_seconds'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data to external systems. It raises exceptions and logs information locally. No untrusted data is directly written to files, network, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used for filtering (though filtering implementation is not shown here). SQL script is loaded and executed, and errors are handled by raising exceptions. There are no apparent flows of untrusted data into potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs straightforward database querying, logging, and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present. The SQL script's content is external and not shown, but loading external SQL scripts is a common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code loads an external SQL script, retrieves lock information via a database API, and handles errors appropriately. It logs progress and errors but does not process or output untrusted or sensitive data beyond internal use. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The functions and exception handling appear standard and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate diagnostic utility for database lock contention. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. It relies on external SQL scripts and APIs for its core functionality, which are typical for such tools.",
