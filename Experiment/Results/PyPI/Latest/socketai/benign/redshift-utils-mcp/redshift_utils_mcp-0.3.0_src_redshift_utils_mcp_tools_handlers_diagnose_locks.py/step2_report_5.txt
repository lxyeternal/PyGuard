  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Code Summary & Key Points:**\n- Loads an external SQL script (`locks/blocking_pids.sql`) via `load_sql()`.\n- Retrieves configuration via `get_data_api_config()`.\n- Executes SQL with `execute_sql()`.\n- Handles exceptions broadly, logs progress.\n- Returns lock data as a list of dictionaries.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic visible.\n- The primary risk lies in the external SQL script potentially being malicious if tampered with.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Concerns:\n- **Issue presence:** The code does **not** contain malicious behavior or malware directly. It performs legitimate database diagnostics.\n- **Potential risk:** The only concern is the external SQL script's integrity. If compromised, it could execute malicious SQL, but this is outside the code's control.\n- **Error handling:** Broad but standard; no hidden malicious intent.\n- **Data flow:** Safe, as data is retrieved from a trusted source (external SQL) and processed locally.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** None detected in the code itself.\n- **Scores:** Given the above, the malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior; external SQL loading is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The risk is minimal, assuming trusted SQL files.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep scores as is.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1-0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. Slightly lower risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard diagnostic code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity; straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Slight concern about the external SQL script being tampered with; logs could leak info.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The primary concern is external SQL integrity, not malware.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (0.2) due to external SQL reliance is reasonable, but no direct malicious activity.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to external SQL script loading, but not inherently risky if scripts are trusted)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The scores are reasonable and justified. No adjustments needed. The code appears to be a legitimate diagnostic utility with minimal security risks, primarily contingent on external SQL script integrity.",
