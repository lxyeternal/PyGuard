{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to diagnose lock contention issues in a database cluster by querying lock information.",
  "sources": "Reads the SQL script 'locks/blocking_pids.sql' using load_sql(), and retrieves data via execute_sql() with a configuration from get_data_api_config().",
  "sinks": "Returns the list of lock entries (all_locks). No untrusted data is written or sent elsewhere in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from loading the SQL script, executing it to retrieve lock data, and then returning this data without modification or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard exception handling. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads a SQL script and executes it to gather lock data, handling various exceptions that may occur. The code uses typical patterns for database access and error handling. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The functions and variables are straightforward, with no suspicious logic or data flow that would indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for diagnosing lock contention. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It operates within normal expectations for database diagnostics.",
