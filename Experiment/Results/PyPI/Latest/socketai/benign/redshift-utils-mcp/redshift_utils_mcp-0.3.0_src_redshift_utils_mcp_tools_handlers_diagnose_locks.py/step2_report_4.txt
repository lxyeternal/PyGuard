  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Loads an external SQL script (`locks/blocking_pids.sql`) via `load_sql()`.\n- Retrieves configuration data via `get_data_api_config()`.\n- Executes the SQL query with `execute_sql()`.\n- Handles exceptions broadly, logs progress, and returns the data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code appears to function as intended for diagnosing lock contention.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No direct evidence. The code relies on external SQL scripts, which could be tampered with but is a common pattern.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main concern is the external SQL script, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is external to the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior, standard exception handling, external SQL loading is typical.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The low risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious patterns, standard practices.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1**\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion, straightforward diagnostic code, external SQL loading.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, very straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Score: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**\n- **Analysis:** Notes potential risk if SQL script is malicious, but this is external risk, not code itself.\n- **Verdict:** Fairly low, but acknowledges external risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign `0`.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1-0.2). The risk is primarily external — if the SQL script is tampered with, it could pose a threat, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### **Overall reasoning:**\n- The code is a standard diagnostic utility.\n- The main security concern is external SQL script integrity, not the code itself.\n- Exception handling is broad but does not mask malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly elevated due to external dependency but generally low.\n\n**Note:** If the external SQL script is trusted and maintained securely, the overall security risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate lock contention diagnostic tool.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- External SQL script integrity is the main external risk, but not reflected in the code itself.\n- The current scores are appropriate, but I would slightly lower the risk score to **0.1** to reflect the minimal inherent risk assuming trusted scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
