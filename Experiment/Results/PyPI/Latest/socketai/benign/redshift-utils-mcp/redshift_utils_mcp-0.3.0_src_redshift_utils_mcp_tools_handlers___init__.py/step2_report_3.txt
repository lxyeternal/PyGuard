  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward `__init__.py` file that imports specific handler functions from local modules and defines an `__all__` list for export.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, data processing, external data handling, or any code that could be malicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The structure is typical for a Python package's interface module.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies, malware, or security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and all reports agree on the benign nature.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for organizing and exporting handler functions without any data flow or external communication.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk score should be very low, ideally 0.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only importing and exporting functions, any malicious behavior would have to originate from the imported modules themselves. However, based solely on this file, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The reports do not mention any indirect risks, which is appropriate because this file doesn't execute or process data.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - The overall assessment aligns with expectations: the code is a standard, safe module initializer.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign package interface with no security concerns.",
