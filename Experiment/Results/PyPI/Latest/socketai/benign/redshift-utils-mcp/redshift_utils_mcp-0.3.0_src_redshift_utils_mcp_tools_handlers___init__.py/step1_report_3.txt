{
  "purpose": "This code is for exporting a set of tool handler functions related to Redshift utilities, facilitating their import elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code imports handler functions from sibling modules within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or execute untrusted data; it only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this snippet; it only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific handler functions from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It serves as an initialization or index file to facilitate organized access to handlers. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard Python module initializer with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard module export file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply re-exports functions for use elsewhere, with no signs of malicious intent.",
