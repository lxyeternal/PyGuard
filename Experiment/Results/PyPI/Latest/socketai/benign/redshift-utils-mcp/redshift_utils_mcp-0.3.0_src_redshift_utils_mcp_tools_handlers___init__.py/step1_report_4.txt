{
  "purpose": "This module exports multiple handler functions related to Redshift utilities, facilitating their use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as check_cluster_health, diagnose_locks, diagnose_query_performance, execute_ad_hoc_query, get_table_definition, inspect_table, monitor_workload.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute potentially dangerous operations are present within this file.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports functions and defines an export list; no data flows or processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for an __init__.py module.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard Python package initializer that imports specific handler functions from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, or other risky constructs. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or network communication. As such, it poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on its content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard package initialization file that exports handler functions for Redshift utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet.",
