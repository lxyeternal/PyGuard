{
  "purpose": "This module exports several handler functions related to Redshift utility operations, facilitating organized access to these functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from other modules within the same package directory, specifically from check_cluster_health, diagnose_locks, diagnose_query_performance, execute_ad_hoc_query, get_table_definition, inspect_table, and monitor_workload.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code snippet; it only exports functions and does not perform any data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "This code establishes a collection of handler functions for external modules to use; no data flows or untrusted input processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present in this straightforward initialization and export script.",
  "analysis": "The script solely imports specific handler functions from local modules and declares an __all__ list for export. It functions as an organized index for handler exports, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an interface rather than executing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer that exports a set of handler functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Its purpose is to organize exports for the package, with no data processing or external communication involved.",
