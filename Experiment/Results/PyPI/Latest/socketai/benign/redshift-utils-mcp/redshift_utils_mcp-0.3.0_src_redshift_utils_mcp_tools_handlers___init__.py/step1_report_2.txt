  "purpose": "This code exports handler functions for various tools related to Redshift utilities, facilitating modular access to specific operational functions.",
  "sources": "Imports handler functions from local modules in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no user input or external data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the code only establishes references to imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific handler functions and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no logic, data processing, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure aligns with typical Python package module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module responsible for organizing and exporting handler functions for various tools. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
