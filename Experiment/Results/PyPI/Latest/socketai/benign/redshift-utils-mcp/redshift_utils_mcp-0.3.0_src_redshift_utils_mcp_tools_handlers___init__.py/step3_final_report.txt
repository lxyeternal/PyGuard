{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an initializer that imports specific handler functions from local modules and exports them for external use, organizing the codebase's interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions (sources) and exports them via __all__, with no data flow or external communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports handler functions and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or external communication. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The structure is typical for a package initializer, and no security concerns are evident from this snippet. The imported modules are not provided, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Python module initializer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
