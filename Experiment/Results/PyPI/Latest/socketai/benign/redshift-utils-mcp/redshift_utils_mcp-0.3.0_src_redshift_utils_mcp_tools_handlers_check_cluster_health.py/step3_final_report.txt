{
  "purpose": "The code performs asynchronous execution of predefined SQL scripts to assess cluster health, capturing results or errors for each script.",
  "sources": "SQL scripts loaded via load_sql() function, based on script names and parameters derived from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Results stored in a dictionary; logs and progress reports are routine; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Scripts are loaded, executed with execute_sql(), and results/errors are stored in raw_results_dict; progress is reported via ctx.report_progress.",
  "anomalies": "Minor syntax bug: missing comma in basic_scripts list between 'health/queuing_summary.sql' and 'workload/wlm_trend_hourly.sql', which could cause incorrect script inclusion.",
  "analysis": "The code loads predefined SQL scripts asynchronously, executes them with error handling, and logs progress. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution is present. The only issue is a minor syntax error that may affect script inclusion but not security. External scripts are trusted, but if tampered, could pose a supply chain risk. The code itself is standard for health checks, with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by external script trust assumptions. The high confidence score (0.9) reflects the straightforward nature of the code and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured cluster health check routine executing predefined scripts. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The minor syntax bug may affect script inclusion but does not impact security. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
