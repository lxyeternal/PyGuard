{
  "purpose": "This code performs a health check on a Redshift cluster by executing multiple diagnostic SQL scripts concurrently and collecting their results or errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQL script files loaded via load_sql() function, and possibly from the context object (ctx) for logging and reporting.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored in a dictionary; no direct untrusted data output. No external data sinks or network connections are explicitly shown within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input: script names and parameters from the predefined list; output: results or exceptions stored in raw_results_dict, and progress/reporting via ctx methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The script loading and execution appear standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads SQL scripts and executes them asynchronously, handling exceptions properly. It logs activity and reports progress, with no evident malicious behavior. All external interactions are related to expected script loading, execution, and logging. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a cluster health check utility. It loads and runs SQL scripts to diagnose the system, with appropriate error handling and logging. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is observed.",
