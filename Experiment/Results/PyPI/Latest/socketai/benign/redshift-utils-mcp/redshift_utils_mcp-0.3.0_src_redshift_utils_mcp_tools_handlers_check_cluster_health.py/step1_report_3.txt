{
  "purpose": "This code performs an asynchronous health check of a Redshift cluster by executing diagnostic SQL scripts, collecting results or errors.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL script files via load_sql, accesses configuration via get_data_api_config, and receives context info and reports via ctx object.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL scripts with execute_sql; logs errors with ctx.error; reports progress with ctx.report_progress.",
  "flows": "Loads SQL scripts -> Executes scripts via execute_sql -> Stores results or errors in raw_results_dict -> Reports progress and logs via ctx methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code behavior; external functions appear standard; no obfuscated code or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward asynchronous process: loading SQL scripts, executing them with provided configs, capturing results or errors, and reporting progress. It handles exceptions gracefully and logs appropriately. The script list includes both basic and full health checks, and parameters are passed explicitly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. It relies on standard external libraries and functions for SQL execution and configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate health check utility for a cluster, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately handles errors and logs diagnostic information. Overall, it seems safe and well-structured, with no indications of malware or malicious anomalies.",
