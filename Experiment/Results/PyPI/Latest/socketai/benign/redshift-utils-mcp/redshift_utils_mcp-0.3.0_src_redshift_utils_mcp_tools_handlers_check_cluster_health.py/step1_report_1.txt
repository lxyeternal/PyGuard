{
  "purpose": "The code performs a cluster health check by executing various SQL scripts concurrently, collecting results or errors into a dictionary, and reporting progress.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from script names loaded via load_sql, parameters based on function arguments, and context info/logging calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be in the SQL scripts or results, but no direct untrusted data output or network communication is evident.",
  "flows": "SQL scripts are loaded and executed; results are stored in raw_results_dict; errors are caught and logged; progress reporting and info logs are used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code loads external SQL scripts without validation, but this is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. No network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads predefined SQL scripts and executes them asynchronously, capturing results and errors without user input. The script execution is controlled and does not include user-supplied data beyond parameters which are simple string conversions. Error handling is standard, and logging is used for debugging and info purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, network exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The script relies on external SQL files, but there is no indication of tampering or malicious content within this code. Overall, it appears to be a standard health check routine with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a cluster health check using predefined SQL scripts, with proper error handling and logging. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this code segment.",
