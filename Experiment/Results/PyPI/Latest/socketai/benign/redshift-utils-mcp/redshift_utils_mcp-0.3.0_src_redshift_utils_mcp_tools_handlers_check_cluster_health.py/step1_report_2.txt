{
  "purpose": "This code performs a health check of a Redshift cluster by executing diagnostic SQL scripts asynchronously and aggregating results.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include SQL script files loaded via load_sql(), configuration retrieved from get_data_api_config(), and parameters such as 'level' and 'time_window_days'.",
  "sinks": "Results of SQL execution are stored in raw_results_dict; errors are logged and stored, but there are no untrusted data sinks that could leak or modify data outside the process.",
  "flows": "Source: load_sql() and get_data_api_config() provide scripts and configs; Data flows into execute_sql(), and results or errors flow into raw_results_dict; logs and progress reports are generated throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard async patterns, safe API calls, and clear error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads predefined SQL scripts, executes them asynchronously with proper error handling, and stores the results or exceptions. There are no signs of malicious data manipulation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. It does not handle untrusted user input; parameters are explicitly set, and scripts are loaded from files. Logging appears routine. Overall, the code performs a structured, legitimate health check without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard health check utility that executes diagnostic scripts asynchronously, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It follows good practices for error handling and logging, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious behaviors.",
