  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is for workload data collection, loading SQL scripts via `load_sql()` and configuration via `get_data_api_config()`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results stored in `raw_results_dict`, straightforward flow, no suspicious data leaks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors detected. Exception handling is standard.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Results stored in dict, errors logged, no data leaks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code. The code performs standard async SQL execution.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-argued, high confidence (0.95).  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — still low, acceptable for such a monitoring tool.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizes standard workload monitoring.  \n- No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.  \n- Scores are aligned with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on the same points: external SQL scripts, asynchronous execution, no malicious activity.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or backdoors.  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Mentions potential sinks: `execute_sql()` and logging functions.  \n- Notes that `load_sql()` loads predefined scripts, not user input, which is correct.  \n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors.  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose and no malicious behavior, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious payloads.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the potential for misuse if scripts or configurations are compromised, but not evident here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code. The scores reflect the benign nature of this workload monitoring script. No adjustments are necessary.",
