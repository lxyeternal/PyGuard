{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to configure and start the Redshift MCP server using AWS Data API credentials, environment variables, and command-line options.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line options (--cluster-id, --database, --secret-arn, --region, --profile) and environment variables (REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_ID, REDSHIFT_DATABASE, REDSHIFT_SECRET_ARN, AWS_REGION, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_PROFILE).",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables to pass configuration data to downstream processes (mcp.run()) and sets environment variables directly within the code before server startup.",
  "flows": "Command-line options and environment variables are read into 'final_config'. Missing configurations cause error termination. The environment variables are set based on input, then the server is started via mcp.run().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found. No obfuscated code or unusual language constructs. No indications of data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages configuration for starting a server, relying on environment variables and command-line options. It performs validation for required parameters and logs information. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data theft, system compromise, or covert communications. All data flows are benign and related to configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI configuration and startup script for a server, with no malicious intent. It responsibly manages configuration inputs and errors without including harmful behavior or suspicious code patterns.",
