  "purpose": "CLI utility for configuring and starting the Redshift MCP server via environment variables and command-line options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments and environment variables for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables set for downstream server startup; no direct data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from CLI/env -> environment variables -> server startup via mcp.run()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; standard environment variable handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration parameters securely, validates required inputs, and initiates server startup. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Environment variable manipulation is typical but could be exploited if inputs are malicious, though this is standard practice in CLI tools. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper for server configuration and startup. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The environment variable handling, while potentially exploitable if inputs are malicious, is standard and does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use.",
