{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to configure and run the Redshift Utils MCP Server using AWS Data API.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line options, environment variables, and within the code to set environment variables and configure server parameters.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables based on user input; calls the server's run method, which may access configured resources.",
  "flows": "Command-line options/envvars -> environment variables -> server startup via mcp.run()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging, defines a CLI command with options tied to environment variables, and loads configuration from inputs or environment. It validates presence of required configuration variables before attempting to start the server. The server is invoked via mcp.run(), which is outside this code but appears to be a standard server start. No code injections, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The environment variables are set based on inputs, which is standard for CLI tools. The error handling is straightforward and does not conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper for server startup, with proper validation and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk appears low.",
