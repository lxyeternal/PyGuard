{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for configuring and starting the Redshift Utils MCP Server, mainly orchestrating environment variable setup and initiating server run.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line options (--cluster-id, --database, --secret-arn, --region, --profile) and environment variables (REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_ID, REDSHIFT_DATABASE, REDSHIFT_SECRET_ARN, AWS_REGION, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_PROFILE).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are environment variables set from input sources, which influence subsequent server behavior; particularly sensitive variables like AWS credentials or database identifiers.",
  "flows": "Input sources (CLI options or environment variables) flow into environment variable assignments and the final configuration dictionary, which guides server startup.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard configuration setup with no unusual or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. All environment variable handling appears straightforward. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily gathers configuration data from CLI and environment variables, logging the process and handling missing variables gracefully. It sets environment variables based on inputs and then calls an external server run function. There is no code that performs network connections, data exfiltration, or other suspicious activities. Error handling and logging are standard. No suspicious or malicious code patterns or behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI setup and configuration loader for starting a server. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It simply manages environment variables and initiates a server process, with appropriate checks for required configuration parameters.",
