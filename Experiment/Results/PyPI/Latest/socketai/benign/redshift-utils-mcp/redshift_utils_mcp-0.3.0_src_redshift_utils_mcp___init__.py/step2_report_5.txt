  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe only a header comment, version string, and references to external SQL scripts or repositories.\n   - No executable code, data processing, network operations, or logic are present in the snippets.\n   - Based on the provided content, there are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in noting the absence of executable code, data flows, or anomalies.\n   - They correctly identify that the snippet is purely descriptive and contains no security-sensitive operations.\n   - No logical errors are evident; the assessments align with the content.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1.0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the minimal, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - Since the code is only descriptive, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The content shows no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the lack of executable code.\n   - They correctly interpret the content as purely descriptive.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the content described.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Based on the provided code snippets and reports:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My Reasoned Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is purely descriptive, with no executable logic or security concerns. Therefore, the current scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nIf in the future, actual implementation code or external scripts are included, a reassessment would be warranted. For now, the minimal header and documentation pose no security threat.",
