  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting query results into different formats (JSON, CSV, table).",
  "sources": "Input data in the form of a list of dictionaries passed to format_result; internal result data within formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; output is formatted strings based on input data.",
  "flows": "Input data -> format_result() -> formatting functions -> formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed. The code uses standard libraries and performs safe formatting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to format query results into JSON, CSV, or table formats. It performs input validation and uses standard Python libraries (json, csv, io, logging). No external inputs are used insecurely, and there are no code injections, network operations, or data leaks. Error handling is standard and does not include unsafe practices. The functions do not execute untrusted code, nor do they handle sensitive data insecurely. All operations are safe, typical for formatting utilities, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate formatting utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe data formatting and handles errors appropriately without suspicious or harmful actions.",
