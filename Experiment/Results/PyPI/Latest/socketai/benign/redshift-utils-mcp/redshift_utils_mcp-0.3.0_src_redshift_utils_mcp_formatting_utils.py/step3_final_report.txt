  "sources": "Input data structures (list of dicts) provided to formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Output strings generated by formatting functions; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data -> formatting functions -> formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data serialization with input validation, error handling, and logging. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or access external resources. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The use of standard libraries and clear structure indicates benign intent. Error handling is appropriate, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for formatting query results with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0 and minimal security risk. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as such.",
