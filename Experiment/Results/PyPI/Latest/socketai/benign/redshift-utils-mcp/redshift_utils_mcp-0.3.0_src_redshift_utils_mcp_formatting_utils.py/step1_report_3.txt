  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting query results into various formats such as JSON, CSV, and table.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'result' parameter in 'format_result' and '_format_as_table' functions, which are lists of dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Output is generated as formatted strings; no direct data sinks are present in the code. No data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'result' input through formatting functions, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of logging is standard and does not introduce security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code provides formatting utilities for query results, supporting JSON, CSV, and table formats. It includes checks for empty or invalid results and handles errors gracefully. No external system calls, network activities, or file writes outside the formatting functions are present. The code does not handle or process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or other malicious behaviors. Logging is used for warnings and errors, which is standard practice. Overall, the functions perform data formatting without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input data solely for formatting purposes and does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
