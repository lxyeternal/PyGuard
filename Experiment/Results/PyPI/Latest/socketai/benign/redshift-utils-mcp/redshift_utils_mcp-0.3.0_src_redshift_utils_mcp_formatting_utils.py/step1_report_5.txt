  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for formatting query results into JSON, CSV, or table formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'result' parameter in format_result and _format_as_table functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs formatted data to external systems or logs, but no external data sinks directly from untrusted sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments to formatted string outputs; no untrusted external data is fetched or sent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Logging is used, but not in a suspicious manner. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data formatting tasks: converting list of dicts into JSON, CSV, or a text table. It includes error handling and logging. The functions operate solely on passed data, with no evident external data fetching or malicious behavior. No signs of data leakage, injection, or malicious side effects are detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be for formatting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for formatting query results and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and free from malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
