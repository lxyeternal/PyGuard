  "purpose": "Utilities for formatting query results into JSON, CSV, or table formats.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters 'result' and 'format_type'; logging statements; file-like object 'io.StringIO()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output through return statements; logging outputs; use of 'json.dumps()' and 'csv.DictWriter()' which process data for output.",
  "flows": "Input 'result' flows into formatting functions; data is serialized via json.dumps(), csv.DictWriter writes to StringIO, or formatted into a table string; outputs returned as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Logging is standard; data serialization is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for formatting query results into various formats. It performs input validation, logging, and safe data serialization. No untrusted input is directly executed or used in insecure operations. Logging is for debugging and error reporting, not for data exfiltration. Usage of 'json.dumps()' and 'csv.DictWriter()' is standard and safe when handling untrusted data, as they only serialize data. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, focusing on data formatting without external calls, network activity, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for formatting data outputs. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malicious code patterns. No security risks are evident. Overall, the code is safe and free from malicious intent.",
