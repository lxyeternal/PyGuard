  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code loads and executes multiple SQL scripts asynchronously, handles exceptions, logs progress, and returns raw results. It explicitly raises `QueryNotFound` if no query data is found, and propagates other errors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, given the benign nature of the code)\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The external SQL loading via `load_sql()` and execution via `execute_sql()` are standard. Error handling is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe loading and execution of SQL scripts, proper exception handling, and standard logging.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no secrets or backdoors. The pattern of loading and executing scripts is typical.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on orchestrating SQL script loading and execution, with error handling and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with standard practices.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe, standard async execution, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution beyond loading scripts.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code loads multiple SQL scripts asynchronously, handles errors, and returns raw results. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no backdoors or data exfiltration signs.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are consistently low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security risk given the code's function and the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern could be if `load_sql()` or `execute_sql()` are insecure, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet. The pattern used is standard for SQL script execution.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain low, around 0.1–0.2, as the reports suggest.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to external script loading, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign query performance diagnostic handler with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
