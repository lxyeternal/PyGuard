{
  "purpose": "This code handles asynchronous execution of multiple SQL scripts for diagnosing query performance, collecting metrics, plans, and alerts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (query_id, compare_historical), and loads SQL scripts via load_sql().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execute_sql() which runs the SQL, and exception handling that propagates errors; no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: input parameters and load_sql() -> execute_sql() with parameters -> results stored in raw_results_dict -> exception handling and logging -> return of raw_results_dict.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously loads and executes predefined SQL scripts with parameters, handles exceptions properly, logs progress, and returns raw results. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The external functions load_sql() and execute_sql() are assumed secure; the code does not perform any network activity or dynamic code evaluation. Error handling is standard, and the overall logic is typical for a diagnostic utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from external script loading, which is standard practice. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score low (~0.1-0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high.",
