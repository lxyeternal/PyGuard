It loads SQL scripts, executes them with parameters, handles exceptions appropriately, and logs various states. The loading of scripts via load_sql() and execution via execute_sql() is a normal pattern. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Error handling is standard, and the code only interacts with expected external systems. The logs and results are kept internal, with no indications of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The code structure and function usage appear legitimate and intended for performance diagnostics, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a standard, benign diagnostic handler for query performance analysis.
