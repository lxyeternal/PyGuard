  "purpose": "Handler for inspecting table details.",
  "sources": "load_sql() for SQL scripts, input parameters schema_name and table_name, execute_sql() for running SQL commands, and the dynamic 'SHOW TABLE' SQL construction.",
  "sinks": "Results from execute_sql(), extracted DDL strings, and exceptions raised during script execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SQL scripts via load_sql() and string formatting; scripts execute and return data or exceptions; results are collected and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic SQL for 'SHOW TABLE' constructed with minimal quote escaping; reliance on load_sql() for script loading; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a table's OID, then concurrently executes multiple predefined scripts to gather metadata, storage, health, and DDL info. It constructs SQL dynamically with quote escaping to mitigate injection risks. Exception handling is comprehensive. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic SQL construction presents a minimal injection risk if inputs are malicious, but quoting reduces this. The scripts are loaded via load_sql(), which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate database inspection utility with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate database inspection handler with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minimal dynamic SQL risk is mitigated by quoting. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context. The assessments in the critical reports are consistent with this analysis.",
