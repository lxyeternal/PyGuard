  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate database inspection handler with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minimal dynamic SQL risk is mitigated by quoting. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context. The assessments in the critical reports are consistent with this analysis."
