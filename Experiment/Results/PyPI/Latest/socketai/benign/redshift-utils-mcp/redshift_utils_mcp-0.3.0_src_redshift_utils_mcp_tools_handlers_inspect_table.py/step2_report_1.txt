  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and my own evaluation.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It retrieves a table's OID from the database.\n- It then executes multiple predefined SQL scripts to gather metadata, storage, health, usage, and DDL info.\n- SQL scripts are loaded via `load_sql()`.\n- For the 'SHOW TABLE' command, it constructs SQL dynamically with quote escaping.\n- It handles exceptions appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate database inspection utility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the code's intent well.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identifies sources and sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Finds no issues; notes careful quote escaping.\n- **Analysis:** Concludes no malicious behavior, well-structured, secure.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Highlights potential data leakage if inputs are untrusted, but the code uses quote escaping.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes dynamic SQL and load_sql, but considers them standard.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior, standard operations.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Similar to above; mentions dynamic SQL construction.\n- **Anomalies:** Slight concern about load_sql source, but deemed standard.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, proper error handling.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Highlights potential risk in dynamic SQL, but notes quote escaping.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious intent, standard pattern.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Same as others; dynamic SQL for 'SHOW TABLE' is a potential concern.\n- **Anomalies:** Recognizes risk but notes minimal mitigation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the risk is standard for such code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently at 0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero security concern mainly due to dynamic SQL construction with user inputs. This is a typical concern in database tools but is mitigated here with quote escaping.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- The dynamic SQL for 'SHOW TABLE' is constructed with minimal escaping (adding quotes if no quotes are present). While this is generally safe, if `schema_name` or `table_name` are maliciously crafted with embedded quotes or special characters, there could be injection risk. However, the code's attempt to quote identifiers reduces this risk.\n- The scripts are loaded via `load_sql()`, which could be a concern if the source is compromised, but this is standard practice, and no evidence suggests malicious scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured database inspection utility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering the potential for injection if inputs are untrusted, but the code's mitigation measures are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (appropriate, given the dynamic SQL construction and input handling)\n\n**Overall:** The assessments in the reports are consistent with my analysis. The code is a standard, secure database inspection handler with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If inputs (`schema_name`, `table_name`) are from untrusted sources, additional sanitization could be recommended. But as per current analysis, the code's measures are sufficient.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2",
