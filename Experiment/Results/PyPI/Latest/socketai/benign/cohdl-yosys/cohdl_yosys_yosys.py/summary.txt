  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured automation framework for hardware project management and verification. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to subprocess calls executing trusted external tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical low-level risks associated with subprocess execution in automation scripts."
