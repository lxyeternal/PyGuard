  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions (YosysTestCase, YosysParams) from a local module named 'yosys'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local 'yosys' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input is processed or output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output flows, or data propagation paths in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues within this small fragment. The absence of additional code prevents identifying any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it poses no security concerns.",
