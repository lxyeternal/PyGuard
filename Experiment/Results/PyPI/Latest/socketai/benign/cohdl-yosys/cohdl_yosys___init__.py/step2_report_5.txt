  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Importing classes from a local module; straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no data flow, no external communication.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies this as benign. The code is a simple import statement with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Same as above; local import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data flow or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the assessment aligns with the code snippet. The import is standard, and no malicious activity is evident. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Same as above; local module import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) possibly due to the less explicit nature of the description, but still reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Same as above; local import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, data handling, or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Same as above; local import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement from a local module.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk is present.\n- The scores assigned (all zero for malware and security risk, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; importing classes from a local module does not pose a security risk.\n\n**Overall, the assessments are accurate and consistent.** No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is a benign import statement with no security implications.",
