  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes (YosysTestCase, YosysParams) from a module named .yosys, likely for use in testing or parameter configuration related to Yosys, an open-source synthesis tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from a local module (.yosys). No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output handling present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing specific classes from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity. The minimal structure and standard import statement suggest typical usage within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal component of Python code structure.",
