  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue present?** No. The code is a straightforward import statement with no data flow, no external inputs, and no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with the benign nature. Confidence is high (1). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue present?** No. Same as above; it's a simple import with no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment. Confidence is 1. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue present?** No. Again, a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate. Confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still acceptable. No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue present?** No. Same reasoning applies.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, consistent with benign code. Confidence is 1. No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue present?** No. The import is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, which is correct. Confidence is 0.9, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are consistent with the code snippets.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is purely a standard import statement from a local module, with no data flow or external communication.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, since there's no security concern.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of these snippets, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
