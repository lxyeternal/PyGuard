{
  "purpose": "Import classes YosysTestCase and YosysParams from a local module named yosys.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a relative module path: .yosys.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications are involved.",
  "flows": "The import statement creates a direct source-to-sink flow within the code's context, but it is benign and does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import from a local module, with no data processing, network activity, or external input handling. The code structure is standard, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The confidence in benignity is high (1), malware likelihood is zero, and security risk is minimal (0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
