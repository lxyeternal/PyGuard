  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate hardware description and verification utility library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but within its scope, it is safe."
