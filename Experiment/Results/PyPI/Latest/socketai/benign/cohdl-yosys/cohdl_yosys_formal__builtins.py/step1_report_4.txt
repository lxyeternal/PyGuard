{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes, attributes, and utility functions for hardware description and formal verification support using the cohdl library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'code' in '_YosysInlineCode' class, attribute parameters, and signals like 'inp' in 'is_onehot' functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting functions that generate VHDL code and assertions/checks for formal verification states.",
  "flows": "Data flows from attribute inputs or signal inputs through functions like 'is_onehot', 'is_onehot_or_0', and verification control functions ('_set_formal_tools_active') which influence runtime behavior and code generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code primarily defines attributes, wrappers, and verification helpers. The use of 'assert' statements for runtime checks is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard set of classes and functions for hardware description and formal verification support. The class 'vhdl' modifies text for VHDL code generation. Attribute wrappers define custom attributes for hardware signals, with support for 'anyconst', 'anyseq', etc. The functions 'is_onehot' and 'is_onehot_or_0' generate code strings for one-hot checks, used in hardware assertions. The functions '_set_formal_tools_active' and 'formal_tools_active' manage a global flag for formal verification mode, with assertions ensuring proper context. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code's structure and purpose align with hardware design and verification tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign hardware description and verification utility library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly defines helper classes, attributes, and verification functions for hardware modeling and formal checks.",
