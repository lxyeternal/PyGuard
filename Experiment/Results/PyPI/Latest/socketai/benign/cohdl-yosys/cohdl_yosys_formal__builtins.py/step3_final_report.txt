{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for hardware description, attribute management, VHDL post-processing, and formal verification control within a hardware modeling framework.",
  "sources": "Attribute definitions, string formatting functions for code snippets, global verification flags, and input parameters for functions like is_onehot.",
  "sinks": "String outputs for code snippets, verification flags, and attribute modifications that influence hardware modeling and verification workflows.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., signals, code strings) are processed through functions that generate code snippets or modify global flags, with no external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for hardware description utilities. The use of global variables and string formatting is typical and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility classes and functions for hardware description and formal verification, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The functions generate code snippets, manage attributes, and control verification flags in a standard manner. Assertions ensure correct usage. No external system calls or network activity are present. The global verification flag could be misused if manipulated, but this is typical in verification workflows and not malicious. The code's clarity and purpose align with legitimate hardware modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate hardware description and verification utility library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but within its scope, it is safe.",
