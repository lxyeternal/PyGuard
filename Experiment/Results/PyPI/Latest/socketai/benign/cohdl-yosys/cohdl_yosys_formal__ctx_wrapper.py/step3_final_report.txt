  "purpose": "Utility classes for managing execution context and conditionally invoking functions within a controlled environment, likely for hardware description or simulation frameworks.",
  "sources": "Methods decorated with @pyeval, class attributes, stored callables, external function arguments passed to __call__",
  "sinks": "Invocation of external functions (fn), which could execute untrusted code if inputs are malicious",
  "flows": "External functions provided to __call__ are stored in _callables, then invoked within proc_ctx_wrapper via callable()",
  "anomalies": "Use of @pyeval decorator suggests dynamic evaluation; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines context management and conditional invocation classes, with functions stored and invoked later. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of @pyeval indicates dynamic evaluation, which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but appears to be part of a controlled framework. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected. External function execution is a potential vector but is common in callback systems and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.15), justified by the controlled environment and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for context-aware, conditional execution within a framework, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate, primarily due to the execution of external functions, which is typical in callback mechanisms but should be used cautiously if inputs are untrusted.",
