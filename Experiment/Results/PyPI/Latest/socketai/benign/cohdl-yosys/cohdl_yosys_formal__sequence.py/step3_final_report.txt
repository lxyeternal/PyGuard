  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for generating VHDL hardware description code, including sequences, states, conditions, repetitions, and parallel constructs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'precond', 'cond', 'first', 'rest', and internal class attributes used to generate code strings via string formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated VHDL code snippets as strings, produced through formatted output functions like 'write_node' and 'write'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes through methods like 'write_node', 'write', and sequence-building functions into formatted VHDL code strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Use of string formatting is standard for code generation. No external system or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured framework for hardware description code generation, with clear class and method design. It relies on safe string formatting and type checks. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external communications are present. The main security consideration is potential injection if untrusted inputs are used directly, but this is typical for code generators and outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe hardware description DSL for generating VHDL code. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, primarily reflecting the standard concern of injection if inputs are not validated externally.",
