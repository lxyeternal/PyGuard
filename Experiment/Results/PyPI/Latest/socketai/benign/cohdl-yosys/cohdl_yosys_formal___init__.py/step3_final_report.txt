{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of import statements from internal modules, likely part of a larger framework related to sequencing, timing, context management, and logical checks. It serves to include necessary components for further use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows to untrusted sources, as no runtime data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present since the code only imports modules without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating a modular design. There is no code execution, data handling, network activity, or external input/output. The modules suggest functionality related to sequencing, timing, context, and verification. Given this, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence in benignity is justified, and the scores should reflect no malicious or risky activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard import block within a larger framework. The current assessments and scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
