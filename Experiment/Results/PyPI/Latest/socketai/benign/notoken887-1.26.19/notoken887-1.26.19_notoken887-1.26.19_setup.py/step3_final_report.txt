  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() function, including package metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that process untrusted data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional and provocative metadata; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It contains no dynamic code, no network activity, and no embedded malicious logic. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact details, which are suspicious but do not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, assigning a malware score of 0 and obfuscated=0. The security risk scores vary slightly based on metadata suspicion but remain low, around 0.1 to 0.4. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe, with metadata concerns that should be considered in context but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration with suspicious contact information. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary concern is metadata professionalism, not code security. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
