  "purpose": "This script encrypts and decrypts Python code files using a custom TokenCryptor, embedding encrypted content and executing decrypted code dynamically with obfuscation tactics.",
  "sources": "Reads input file content, decrypts or encrypts code lines, and retrieves encrypted data from embedded variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to run decrypted code, which can execute arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> encrypts/decrypts code -> embeds or extracts encrypted data -> executes decrypted code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of large swastika comments for obfuscation, dynamic execution with exec(), reliance on external non-standard module, embedding encrypted code as string variable.",
  "analysis": "The code encrypts/decrypts Python scripts, embedding encrypted content and executing decrypted code via exec(). Heavy comments serve as obfuscation. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the use of exec() on decrypted data introduces significant security risks. The heavy obfuscation and reliance on external modules further complicate security assessment. The pattern allows for arbitrary code execution if the encrypted content is malicious or tampered with, representing a high potential for misuse. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.4, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.7) are justified given these factors.",
  "conclusion": "The script's design enables dynamic execution of encrypted code, which poses substantial security risks if misused or compromised. Heavy obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, but no explicit malicious payloads are detected. The overall security posture is moderate to high risk due to exec() usage and obfuscation, warranting cautious handling and thorough validation before deployment.",
