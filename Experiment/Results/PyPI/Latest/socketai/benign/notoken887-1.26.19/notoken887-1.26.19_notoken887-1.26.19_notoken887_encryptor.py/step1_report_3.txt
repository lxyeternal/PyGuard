{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emoji symbols, serving as a simple character substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods, which operate on string parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs transformed strings, but there are no external data sinks or network operations within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; these methods perform character replacements to encode/decode data, with direct source-to-sink transformation via string replacement.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacements with emoji, without any unusual or obfuscated code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a simple substitution cipher using emoji characters. Both 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods perform mirrored replacement operations to encode and decode data respectively. The implementation is straightforward and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code is self-contained and does not interact with external systems, files, or network. There are no anomalies such as hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The cipher is basic and could be bypassed easily, but it does not present any security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple character substitution cipher implementation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a harmless purpose, possibly for obfuscation or simple encoding.",
