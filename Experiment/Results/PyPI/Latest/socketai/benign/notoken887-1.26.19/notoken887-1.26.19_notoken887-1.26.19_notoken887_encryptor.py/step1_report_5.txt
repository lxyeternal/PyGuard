{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding (obfuscation) of strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements internally; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through character replacement in encrypt(), then reverted in decrypt().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. The replacement patterns are straightforward, and the class performs only basic string transformations.",
  "analysis": "The class TokenCryptor defines two methods, encrypt() and decrypt(), that replace characters with emojis and vice versa. Both functions use chained .replace() calls to perform character substitution, essentially creating a reversible obfuscation scheme. There are no external network calls, no handling of environment variables, no SQL or command execution, and no dynamic code execution. The implementation is simple and stateless, only performing predictable string replacements. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to serve as a basic obfuscation tool rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character substitution obfuscator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
