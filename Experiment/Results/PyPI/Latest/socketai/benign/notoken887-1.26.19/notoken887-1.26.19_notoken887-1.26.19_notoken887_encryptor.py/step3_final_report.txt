  "purpose": "Simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using emojis and characters.",
  "sources": "String input to encrypt() and encrypted_token input to decrypt() functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing transformed strings; no external data or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through replace chain in encrypt(), then output is passed through reverse replace chain in decrypt().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward character replacements, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a direct, symmetrical substitution cipher with no external data access, no obfuscation beyond simple replacements, and no malicious behavior. Both encrypt() and decrypt() methods use static replace chains, ensuring reversibility. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The implementation is transparent and predictable, with no complex or hidden logic. The substitution is weak cryptographically but does not imply malicious intent. The code's benign nature is consistent with the low malware and obfuscated scores, and the minimal security risk score reflects its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward substitution cipher utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
