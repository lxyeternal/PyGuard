{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for encoding and decoding strings through character replacement, effectively a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken as the 'string' parameter in 'encrypt'; 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are returned as modified strings; no external data sinks, network activity, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through sequential replacements in 'encrypt'; the encrypted string is then passed through replacements in 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no external data access, or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward character substitution for obfuscation or simple encryption. No external system calls, no network communication, no handling of untrusted input beyond string replacement. It lacks any malware behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its purpose appears to be obfuscation rather than malicious activity. The implementation is a direct, predictable substitution cipher without complexity or dynamic behavior that could hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to serve a benign purpose, possibly for simple data obfuscation. There are no security risks or malware indications present in this code.",
