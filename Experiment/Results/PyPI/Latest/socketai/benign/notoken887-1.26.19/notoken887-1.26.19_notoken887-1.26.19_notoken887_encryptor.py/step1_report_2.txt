{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character replacement-based encryption and decryption functions for transforming strings into encoded symbols and back.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data leading to data leakage, system calls, network communication, or other effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through chained .replace() calls in encrypt() and decrypt() methods, performing character substitution.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive string replacements for encoding/decoding but does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or security-sensitive actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The design is simplistic, likely obfuscation or encoding, with no malicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to encode and decode strings using character replacements. Both methods are straightforward, using .replace() chains to swap characters with symbols and vice versa. The replacements seem to be for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes, with no indications of malicious intent, such as network activity, file system modifications, or access to environment variables. The implementation does not include any external calls, input/output beyond string replacement, or suspicious logic. The code appears benign and intended for encoding/decoding tasks only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution encoder/decoder with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks, only transforming strings through predefined character mappings.",
