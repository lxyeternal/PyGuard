  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration for publishing or installing the 'datasetsgraphviz' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external system interaction are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static metadata for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The description indicates a placeholder package; no suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, predefined package metadata. All parameters are hardcoded, and there are no dynamic or external inputs. The metadata suggests this is a placeholder package with no active logic, no data processing, and no external network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign placeholder package.",
