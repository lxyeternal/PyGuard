{
  "purpose": "A static setup script for a placeholder Python package, defining minimal metadata with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata within the setup() call, including name, version, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but this is typical for placeholder packages; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report reflects the placeholder status but is not indicative of actual risk. The code poses no security threat and aligns with best practices for minimal package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script serving as a placeholder. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
