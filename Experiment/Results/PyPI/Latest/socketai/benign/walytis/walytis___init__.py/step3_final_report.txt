{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, data leaks, and malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), and package setup scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file modifications, or execution of untrusted code that could lead to security breaches.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) through processing functions to sinks such as network transmission or file writing, including dynamic code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious network domains. In the absence of code, no anomalies are identified.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports consistently indicate the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high where code is described, and low where code is absent. The reasoning aligns with the summaries, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The assessments are cautious and justified given the limited information. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the high confidence levels support the benign assessment. The current scores are consistent and justified based on the summaries.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
