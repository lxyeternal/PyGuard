  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and their justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious activity detected; code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the absence of code content and suspicious patterns.\n- The securityRisk score is low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the lack of evident issues.\n- The malware score is 0, justified by no malicious activity.\n- Confidence is high (0.8), consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious payloads detected; code appears benign, but notes that dynamic eval or exec could pose risks if used with untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis states that no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The mention of eval/exec is cautious; since none are confirmed present, the low malware score (0) is justified.\n- The securityRisk remains low, reflecting typical utility code.\n- Confidence is high, consistent with the reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious behavior; code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the minimal and straightforward code description.\n- Scores are consistent; no suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; cannot analyze, but no signs of malicious activity are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.3.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Given the lack of code, the low confidence (0.3) and low risk score are appropriate.\n- The malware score remains at 0, justified by absence of evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup code; no suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis matches the description; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, justified by the absence of malicious patterns.\n- The securityRisk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature of the code snippets.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate based on the depth of analysis and available information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the lack of suspicious activity, a uniform low risk score (~0.2) is justified.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- If future code snippets include dynamic eval, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity, these scores should be revisited and potentially increased.\n- The current assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the provided information. No adjustments are necessary.",
