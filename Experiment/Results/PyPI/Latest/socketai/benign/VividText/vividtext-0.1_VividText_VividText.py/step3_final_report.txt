  "purpose": "A utility class for styled console output using the 'rich' library, supporting text styles, animated typing, and user prompts.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via the built-in input() function; uses rich.console.Console for output.",
  "sinks": "Outputs styled text to the console; accepts user input via input().",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to the calling context; styled output flows to the console via rich.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It employs standard libraries and functions. The only potential concern is the use of input(), which is typical for CLI apps and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic and interactive, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for styled terminal output and user interaction. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.05-0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
