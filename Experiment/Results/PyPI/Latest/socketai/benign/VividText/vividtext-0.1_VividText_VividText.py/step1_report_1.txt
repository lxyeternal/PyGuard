{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for stylized text output in the console, including typewriter effects, style management, and help information for color options.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the 'input()' function in the 'inputTypewriter' method.",
  "sinks": "User input is collected via 'input()' and the console output is handled through 'rich.console.Console'. No other sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input from 'input()' can flow from user to the program; console outputs flow from internal methods to the display. No external data flow or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unsafe data handling observed. The code appears to be straightforward console styling functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sleep' function and the 'Console' class from the 'rich' library, then defines a class for stylized text output. It includes methods for resetting styles, building style strings, typewriter effects, menu display, input collection, and help documentation. The input collection method calls Python's built-in 'input()', which is standard and safe in this context. No external data sources, network activity, or dangerous code patterns are detected. The code appears solely for console styling and user interaction without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard console styling utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads user input securely via 'input()' and only outputs styled text. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
