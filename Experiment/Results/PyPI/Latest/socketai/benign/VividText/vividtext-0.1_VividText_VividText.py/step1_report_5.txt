{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for styled text output in the terminal with various formatting options and input capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input method 'inputTypewriter' reads user input from the terminal.",
  "sinks": "User input from 'input()' can potentially be used maliciously if fed malicious data; console printing outputs data to the terminal.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'input()' function into the program; styling info flows from internal methods to console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. Use of 'sleep' for pacing is benign. No external network activity, cryptography, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles styled terminal output with options for colors, styles, and user input. No external data sources or network interactions are present. The only potential concern is the 'input()' call, which could be exploited in certain contexts, but as it is a standard input prompt, it does not constitute malicious behavior. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like data exfiltration, system modifications, or obfuscated logic. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for terminal text styling and input.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a styling utility for terminal text output with user input features. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The only notable aspect is its reliance on standard input, which is typical for CLI applications. Overall, the package appears benign.",
