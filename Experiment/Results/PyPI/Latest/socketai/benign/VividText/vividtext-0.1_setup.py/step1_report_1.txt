  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'VividText' including dependency declaration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no external data input, and no suspicious operations are present. The dependencies are limited to a single, well-known package 'rich' with a version requirement. The structure follows typical setup.py conventions without obfuscation or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
