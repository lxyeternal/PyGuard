  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'VividText'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, package requirements, and metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the script does not execute untrusted input or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The script flows from reading package info to calling setup() with specified parameters; no data from untrusted sources flows into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools from setuptools, defines package name, version, packages found automatically, and required dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors. The install_requires list contains a normal dependency on 'rich' with a specified minimum version, which is common in setup scripts. No indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks.",
