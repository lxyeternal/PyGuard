{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'VividText', including its name, version, packages, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information and dependencies via 'setup' arguments and 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the script does not execute or process external input.",
  "flows": "The script collects package metadata and dependencies but does not include data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions to configure packaging, specifies package info, and lists dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No external input handling or network activity is present. The dependencies are standard, and the structure aligns with normal packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup file without malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
