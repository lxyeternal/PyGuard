  "purpose": "This code imports the class VividText from a local module VividText, serving as a standard import statement in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, syntactically correct, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and lack of external activity support a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
