  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user inputs, external modules/files, and dynamic code execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables, dynamic code) to sinks (network, system commands), potentially via eval/exec or data transmission functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (eval/exec), high obfuscation scores, complex or opaque code structures, potential data exfiltration signs, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign in reports 1, 2, 4, and 5, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators, leading to low malware and risk scores. Report 3 highlights dynamic code execution and obfuscation, which are valid concerns; it assigns moderate scores (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.5). These scores are justified given the described patterns. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the evidence, with no concrete malicious payloads detected. The suspicion in report 3 warrants caution but not immediate danger.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally low risk with no definitive malicious activity detected. The moderate suspicion in report 3 is justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation signs. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. Overall, the dependency appears safe with a low to moderate security concern primarily centered on the suspicious patterns noted in report 3.",
