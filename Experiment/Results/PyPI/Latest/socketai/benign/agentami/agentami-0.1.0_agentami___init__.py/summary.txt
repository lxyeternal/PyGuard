  "conclusion": "The code is generally low risk with no definitive malicious activity detected. The moderate suspicion in report 3 is justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation signs. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. Overall, the dependency appears safe with a low to moderate security concern primarily centered on the suspicious patterns noted in report 3."
