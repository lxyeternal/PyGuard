      "conclusion": "The code is generally low risk with no definitive malicious activity detected. The moderate suspicion in report 3 is justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation signs. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. Overall, the dependency appears safe with a low to moderate security concern primarily centered on the suspicious patterns noted in report 3."

      "conclusion": "Report 2 provides a well-reasoned analysis with appropriate scores, considering the potential for obfuscation and dynamic code but no confirmed malicious activity. It is the best candidate for improvement. I will slightly refine its malware score to better align with cautious suspicion, increasing it from 0.2 to 0.3 to reflect the potential concern without overstatement."
