  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but it is unclear without specific code content.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user input functions, or external files (exact sources cannot be determined without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, system commands, or environment variable modifications; specific sinks cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but details cannot be specified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified due to lack of code content; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code snippet, the review is limited. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security issues can be confirmed without code content. No unusual code structures, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The assessment relies on the assumption that the code is standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a detailed review requires actual code content.",
