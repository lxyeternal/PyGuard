  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or context, it is unclear what the exact goal is.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, function parameters, or possibly external sources like environment variables or files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, executing dynamic code, or data output points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through processing functions and potentially to sinks like network or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and uses standard language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard Python constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are detected. The structure and variable usage seem typical. Without specific external data or dynamic behaviors, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious activity. There are no obfuscated sections, and the logic appears legitimate based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not show evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It seems to be a benign utility or processing script with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
