  "conclusion": "Report 2 provides a well-reasoned analysis with appropriate scores, considering the potential for obfuscation and dynamic code but no confirmed malicious activity. It is the best candidate for improvement. I will slightly refine its malware score to better align with cautious suspicion, increasing it from 0.2 to 0.3 to reflect the potential concern without overstatement."
