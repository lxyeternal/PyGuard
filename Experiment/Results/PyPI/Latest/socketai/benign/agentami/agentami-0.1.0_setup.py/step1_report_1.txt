{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'agentami' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads; no network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure. Reading an external file 'README.md' is typical for package description.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, URL, and Python version requirements. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is common practice. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The script does not perform any code execution beyond static data definition, and there are no embedded or obfuscated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a typical package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to configure package installation parameters.",
