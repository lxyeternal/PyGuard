  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of a Python project named 'agentami' by specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description, imports setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment from package metadata to setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.md') without exception handling, but this is a common practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. It reads a local file without exception handling, which is typical but minor. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign malware and risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and well-understood. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the code analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
