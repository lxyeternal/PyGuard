{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'agentami', including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, package requirements, and reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; standard setup configuration, no data leakage or external effect beyond package info.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without exception handling for 'README.md' could be improved but not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for Python packaging. It reads static metadata and a README file to define package information. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is reading 'README.md' without error handling, which is common but not inherently malicious. Overall, the script appears benign with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies, and does not perform any network operations, data collection, or potentially harmful actions.",
