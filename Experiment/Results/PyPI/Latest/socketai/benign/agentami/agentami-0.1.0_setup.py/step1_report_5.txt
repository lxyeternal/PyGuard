  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python project named 'agentami'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident; no network, file writing, or data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description' parameter, but this is a safe, controlled operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code strictly handles package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It imports necessary functions, defines package metadata, reads a README file for description, and specifies dependencies and classifiers. No external input handling, data processing, or network activity occurs. All operations are typical for package configuration. The use of 'open' to read a local file is safe, provided the file exists. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and reads a local README file for documentation purposes.",
