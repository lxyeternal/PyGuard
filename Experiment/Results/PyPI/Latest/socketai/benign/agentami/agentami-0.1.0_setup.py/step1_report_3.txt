  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'agentami' to facilitate package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leakage or external communication code detected.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and README content; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without exception handling; no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, specifying package details, dependencies, author info, and reading a README file for description. There are no signs of suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The 'open' call to read the README.md is typical, but lacks error handling, which is a minor concern but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured, serving its purpose of packaging without any malicious modifications.",
