{
  "purpose": "This code implements a semantic tool retriever that encodes tool descriptions and retrieves relevant tools based on natural language queries using sentence embeddings and FAISS similarity search.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'tools' list (tool descriptions and names), and from the input query string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands are present. The code only performs in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Encodes tool descriptions into embeddings (source) during initialization; encodes the user query (source) during retrieval; searches for nearest neighbors in FAISS index (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code performs standard semantic search functions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a sentence transformer model and FAISS index, encodes tool descriptions, and provides a method to retrieve relevant tools based on a query. All operations are standard for semantic search. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no data leakage, backdoors, or network activity. The code relies on publicly available libraries and standard encoding/search procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of semantic retrieval using sentence embeddings and FAISS. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. It performs expected in-memory processing without external network or file operations.",
