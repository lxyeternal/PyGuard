  "purpose": "A semantic tool retriever that encodes tool descriptions using SentenceTransformer and FAISS to find relevant tools based on natural language queries.",
  "sources": "Reads the list of tools and their descriptions during initialization; encodes descriptions; encodes queries during retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; all operations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Encodes descriptions to build index (source: descriptions; sink: FAISS index), encodes query (source: user input; sink: embedding), searches index (source: query embedding; sink: FAISS search results), maps indices to tool names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a SentenceTransformer model and FAISS index, encodes tool descriptions in batches, and maps index positions to tools. Retrieval encodes user queries and searches for the most similar descriptions. Validation ensures descriptions are non-empty. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The logic is straightforward, with proper error handling and data validation. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of semantic search for tools, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent and justified given the code's behavior.",
