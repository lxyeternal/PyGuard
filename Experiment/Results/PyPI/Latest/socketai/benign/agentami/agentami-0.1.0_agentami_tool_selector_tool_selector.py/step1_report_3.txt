{
  "purpose": "This code implements a semantic tool retriever that encodes tool descriptions and finds relevant tools based on user queries using FAISS and SentenceTransformer embeddings.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'tools' list and 'query' string provided to methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; uses model encoding and FAISS search, which are safe operations.",
  "flows": "Encodes tool descriptions during initialization (source: tools descriptions) -> builds FAISS index -> encodes user query -> searches index -> retrieves tool names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code uses established libraries without unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a sentence embedding model and FAISS index, encodes tool descriptions, and retrieves relevant tools based on semantic similarity. It uses standard libraries and patterns without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or data leaks are evident. The logic is straightforward and typical for semantic search implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a semantic tool retriever with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard encoding and search operations securely. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
