{
  "purpose": "The code implements a semantic tool retrieval system using FAISS and sentence embeddings to find relevant tools based on natural language queries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'tools' list during initialization, specifically from 'tools' descriptions and queries passed to 'get_relevant_tools_only'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or harmful actions are present. No untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input descriptions are encoded with the model; queries are encoded and used to search the FAISS index; the index returns relevant tool indices mapped back to tool names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The code straightforwardly initializes models and indexes, with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a sentence transformer model and FAISS index with tool descriptions, encoding descriptions in batches for efficiency. It performs validation to ensure descriptions are present. The retrieval method encodes a query and searches for top-k matches in the index, returning corresponding tool names. All operations involve in-memory data handling, with no network, file, or environment variable manipulations. No suspicious or malicious logic is present; the code is standard for semantic search implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard semantic tool retriever with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a benign implementation for searching tools based on descriptions using embeddings.",
