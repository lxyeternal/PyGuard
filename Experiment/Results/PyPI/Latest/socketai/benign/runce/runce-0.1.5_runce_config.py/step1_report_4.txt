  "purpose": "Manage configuration and data storage directory for Runce application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the temporary directory path from the environment via gettempdir().",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The code reads the temp directory, constructs a path, and can create the directory if missing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard library functions without any suspicious or obfuscated behavior; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to manage a data directory located within the system's temporary directory. It uses gettempdir() to obtain the temp directory path, then appends a specific folder name. The class provides methods to retrieve this path and ensure its existence. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injections. The code follows typical patterns for directory management and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply manages a data directory within the system's temp folder.",
