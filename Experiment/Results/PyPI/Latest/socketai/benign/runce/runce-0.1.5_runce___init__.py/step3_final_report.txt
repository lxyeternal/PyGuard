  "sources": "Comments, version string, license declaration, and descriptive metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input or output, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, functions, or logic; only descriptive comments and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only descriptive comments, version info, and license statement with no executable code or operational logic. No data flows, input/output handling, or suspicious constructs are present. Given the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, risk score near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Confidence levels are high due to the lack of executable content. No anomalies or suspicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is purely a descriptive header with no operational or malicious content. It poses no security risks, malware threats, or obfuscation concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and should remain as-is.",
