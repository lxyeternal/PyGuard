{
  "purpose": "A lightweight process manager designed to ensure that each command runs exactly once per unique ID.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read any input or data sources; it mainly defines metadata and a description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable from this snippet, as it contains only a description and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal header or description with no actual implementation logic. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a docstring describing the purpose of the process manager, along with version info and license. There are no functions, classes, data input, or execution logic present. Since no operational code is included, there's no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The snippet appears to be a part of a larger project, perhaps documentation or a header comment, but alone it does not contain any executable or risky code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple descriptive header with no executable logic or data handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
