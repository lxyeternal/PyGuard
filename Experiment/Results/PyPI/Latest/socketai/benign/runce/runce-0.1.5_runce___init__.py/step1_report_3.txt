  "purpose": "A lightweight process manager designed to ensure each command runs exactly once per unique ID.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is identifiable as the code is a descriptive header and version declaration only.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only descriptive text, license, version info, and a brief header. No executable logic, input handling, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely a descriptive comment and metadata about the process manager application, with no implementation or logic. Since it contains no executable or data handling code, there are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The absence of any actual code means there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. This code snippet does not demonstrate any potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable descriptive header and license information for a process management tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation in the provided snippet. It appears to be safe and intentionally minimal.",
