{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the behavior of a process management system by launching multiple subprocesses running an infinite loop script, checking their status, and then terminating them. It also includes test fixtures for pytest and a standalone script execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the script from a temporary file (infinite_loop.sh) created in the filesystem. It executes commands via subprocess to run scripts and manage processes.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls execute scripts and commands that control process lifecycle (start, status, tail, kill). The script itself writes output to stdout and interacts with the system shell.",
  "flows": "The code creates a bash script, launches multiple subprocesses executing that script, queries process status, reads process output, and terminates processes. Data flows from script execution to process management functions and output verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The bash script runs an infinite loop with no network activity, and subprocess commands appear to manage processes locally. The code uses standard process management and testing practices without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages subprocesses running an infinite loop bash script, monitoring their status, and terminating them. The subprocess invocations do not involve untrusted input or network communication. The bash script is benign and intended for testing process behavior. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are observed. The code uses standard Python modules and subprocess calls for process control, with no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard process management test suite for subprocess handling, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be designed for testing process supervision and control mechanisms, not for malicious purposes.",
