  "purpose": "The code manages subprocesses running a benign infinite loop bash script, monitors their status, and cleans up. It is used for testing process robustness and process management behavior.",
  "sources": "Process creation via subprocess.Popen, command-line arguments, and filesystem operations (creating and deleting scripts).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution, process status checks, and termination commands; outputs are captured but not used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (script files, command-line args) lead to subprocess creation; outputs from subprocesses are monitored; processes are terminated during cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. The infinite loop scripts are standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard process management testing framework, launching multiple instances of a simple infinite loop bash script, monitoring their status, and cleaning up. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess commands and script contents are benign. The security risk stems from process control practices, but in this controlled environment, it remains minimal. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign process management test harness with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to process control but no malicious intent.",
