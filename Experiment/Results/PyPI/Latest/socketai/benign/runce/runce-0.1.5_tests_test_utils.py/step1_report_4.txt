  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions slugify and get_base_name",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string literals within the test functions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output is compared against expected values within assertions",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by slugify and get_base_name functions, with results compared internally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; commented-out code in tests is benign",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and utility functions, then defines test cases that verify the correctness of slugify and get_base_name functions. The assertions check expected transformations and outputs. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or external communication. The code is straightforward test code that does not process external or untrusted input, nor does it contain any malicious logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard unit test code for utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
