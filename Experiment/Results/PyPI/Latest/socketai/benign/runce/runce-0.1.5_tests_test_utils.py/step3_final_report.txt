  "purpose": "Unit tests for string utility functions 'slugify' and 'get_base_name'.",
  "sources": "Static string literals within test functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used in assertions, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple, static tests for utility functions, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The functions under test are standard string manipulation utilities. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The tests are well-structured, and the code is readable and benign. The reports correctly identify the absence of security risks, malware, or obfuscation, assigning scores of 0 across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories. The confidence level is high (1), given the static and straightforward nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for utility functions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
