  "purpose": "Unit tests for the functions slugify and get_base_name from the runce.utils module.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string literals within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions evaluate the output of slugify and get_base_name; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from string literals into function calls, then the outputs are compared in assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward unit tests using pytest. It tests the behavior of slugify and get_base_name functions with various string inputs, verifying expected outputs. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are involved. The functions appear to be simple utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is standard testing code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic unit testing of utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
