  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions 'slugify' and 'get_base_name' in the 'runce.utils' module",
  "sources": "Input data in function parameters and test assertions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily asserts expected outputs",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, but outputs are tested against expected static values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of straightforward test assertions without hidden or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing functions and utility functions, then defines test cases for 'slugify' and 'get_base_name'. The tests check for string transformations and length constraints. No external data, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is typical unit testing code with no suspicious patterns or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard unit test module for utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
