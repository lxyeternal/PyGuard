  "purpose": "Unit tests for utility functions 'slugify' and 'get_base_name' in the 'runce.utils' module.",
  "sources": "Input data from test function calls with string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to security effects; purely test assertions with static data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by 'slugify' and 'get_base_name' functions; no flow leading to external or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The tests are straightforward and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two test functions that validate the behavior of utility functions. These tests use only static, hardcoded string literals and simple assertions. No data is read from external sources or inputs that could introduce untrusted data. The functions tested appear to perform string sanitization and filename extraction, typical for utility modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly adheres to standard testing practices without invoking any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for utility functions, containing no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It uses static data and assertions, and does not perform any sensitive or external operations.",
