{
  "purpose": "The script tests launching, managing, and cleaning up a long-running process called RunCE, including creating a test script that runs indefinitely.",
  "sources": "User input or environment variables are not directly read; file creation of 'infinite_runner.py'; subprocess commands executing 'python -m runce' with specific arguments.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'python -m runce' commands that control process lifecycle; writing 'infinite_runner.py' to disk.",
  "flows": "Script creates a file -> launches process via subprocess -> checks status and tail logs via subprocess -> cleans up by killing process and deleting file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of 'runce' module assumes external process control but no malicious behavior detected. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary script ('infinite_runner.py') that runs indefinitely, then manages it using 'runce' commands, which seem to be process management commands. All subprocess calls are standard process control commands, and the created script is simple for testing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious activities are evident. The code appears to be a test harness for process management, not malicious. It does not perform any data exfiltration, system damage, or stealthy activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate testing tool for process management using RunCE. It does not contain malicious code or behavior, but it does interact with an external process control module ('runce'). No malware or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
