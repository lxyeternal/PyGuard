  "conclusion": "The script is a benign process management test harness with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, low security risk (~0.2). The external dependency 'runce' does not alter the benign assessment. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
