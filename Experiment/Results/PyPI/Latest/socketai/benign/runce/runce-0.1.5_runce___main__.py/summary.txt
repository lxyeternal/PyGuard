  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no inherent malicious or obfuscated behavior. Security concerns depend on the implementation of main() in the cli module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's appearance and typical security assessment practices."
