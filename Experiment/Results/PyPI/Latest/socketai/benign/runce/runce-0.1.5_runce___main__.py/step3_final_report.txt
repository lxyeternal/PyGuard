  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli and the __name__ check for script execution.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() which may execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import from .cli -> if __name__ == '__main__' -> main() execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point that imports main() from a local module and executes it if run directly. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main() within the cli module, which is not provided. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting caution due to the unknown behavior of main(). The confidence in the benign nature of this snippet is high, given its simplicity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no inherent malicious or obfuscated behavior. Security concerns depend on the implementation of main() in the cli module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's appearance and typical security assessment practices.",
