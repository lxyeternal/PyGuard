  "purpose": "To execute the main function from the cli module if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The script reads the __name__ variable to determine if it is the main module.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call may execute code that interacts with the system, but the code here does not specify what main() does.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: if __name__ == '__main__', call main().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for Python entry-point scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports main from the local cli module. When run directly, it executes main(). There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks in this fragment. Without access to the cli module's implementation, it's impossible to determine if main() performs malicious actions. The script itself is a common pattern for CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a CLI application with no apparent malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet alone. Further review of the cli module is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
