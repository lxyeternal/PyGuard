{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local 'cli' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__name__' variable and imports 'main' from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is called when the script is executed directly; potential sink depends on the implementation of 'main()' in 'cli'.",
  "flows": "If executed as the main program, '__name__' == '__main__', the flow proceeds to call 'main()', which may process untrusted data depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a typical Python entry point, importing a main function from a local module and executing it if run as the main program. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns; the actual security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()' in the 'cli' module, which is not provided. The code itself is straightforward and follows common Python conventions without any obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving solely as an entry point for a CLI application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone. Without the implementation details of 'main()', no further security assessment is possible.",
