  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal, standard CLI entry point: importing `main` from a local `cli` module and executing it when `__name__ == \"__main__\"`.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Potential issues and security implications**:\n   - The actual behavior and security risk hinge entirely on the implementation of the `main()` function within the `cli` module, which is not provided.\n   - The reports correctly note that, in isolation, this code appears benign and follows common Python CLI patterns.\n\n3. **Assessment of scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code snippet's benign appearance.\n   - Security risk scores are low, generally around 0 or 0.1, reflecting the uncertainty due to missing `main()` implementation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the minimal and standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Critical evaluation**:\n   - Since no actual malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the code pattern is standard, there is no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n   - The reports appropriately avoid assumptions about the `main()` function's behavior, emphasizing that security implications depend on its implementation.\n\n5. **Conclusion and recommendations**:\n   - Based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe.\n   - To fully assess security risks, review of the `main()` function's implementation in the `cli` module is necessary.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the evidence.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (minimal, pending further analysis of `main()`)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a typical CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security posture cannot be fully determined without examining the `main()` function, but based on this snippet alone, it is safe.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nMaintain current scores; focus on reviewing the `main()` implementation for any potential security issues.",
