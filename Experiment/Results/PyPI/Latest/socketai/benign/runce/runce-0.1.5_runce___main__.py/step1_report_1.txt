{
  "purpose": "Entry point script that invokes the main function from the cli module to start a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __name__ == \"__main__\" check, which triggers the main() function call.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call is a sink, but without seeing its implementation, we cannot determine if it leads to any malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Importing the main function (source) and calling main() when the script is executed directly (sink), which is standard for CLI entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple entry point script that imports the main() function from the cli module and executes it if the script runs as the main program. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this snippet. Since the actual behavior depends on the implementation of main(), which is not provided, no further malicious analysis can be performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears safe, but full assessment depends on the implementation of the main() function in the cli module.",
