{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute the main function from a local cli module when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import and the execution trigger (__name__ == \"__main__\"), which activates the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The main() function is a sink, as it could execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation in the cli module.",
  "flows": "The source of execution (the script run) leads directly to the main() function call, which may contain further untrusted operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. It does not contain any inline code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "This script imports a main function from a local module named cli. When executed directly, it calls main(). There is no embedded malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic in this fragment. The security concerns depend entirely on the implementation of the main() function within the cli module, which is not provided. As it stands, the code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point for a command-line interface application. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks by itself. Security evaluation of the overall package depends on the content of the cli module. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
