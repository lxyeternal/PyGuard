  "purpose": "Utility functions for string sanitization, process existence check, and filename generation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'value' (string), 'pid' (integer), and 'name' (string).",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write or transmit untrusted data; 'kill' is used internally for process checks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through processing functions; no external data flows to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code includes straightforward utility functions: 'slugify' sanitizes strings, 'check_pid' verifies process existence using 'kill', and 'get_base_name' creates a filename with a hash. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or privacy leaks are present. The use of 'kill' for process checking is standard practice. The hashing and string manipulation are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of harmless utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
