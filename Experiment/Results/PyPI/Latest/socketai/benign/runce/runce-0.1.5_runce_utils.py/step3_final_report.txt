  "purpose": "Utility functions for string sanitization, process existence check, and filename generation.",
  "sources": "Input strings for slugify and get_base_name; process ID for check_pid.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (name, pid) flows through functions without external communication or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions: slugify sanitizes strings for filesystem safety; check_pid uses kill(pid, 0) to verify process existence, a common Unix pattern; get_base_name creates a filename component with a hash. All functions are standard, with no external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The use of kill for process checking is legitimate. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs expected utility tasks without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are standard utilities with safe practices. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal inherent system interaction but no malicious intent.",
