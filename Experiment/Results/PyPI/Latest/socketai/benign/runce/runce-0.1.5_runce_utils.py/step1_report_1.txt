  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for string sanitization, process checking, and filename generation.",
  "sources": "Input strings to slugify and get_base_name functions; system calls within check_pid function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct output to external systems or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string passed to slugify and get_base_name, system call in check_pid using PID input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code offers utility functions: 'slugify' sanitizes strings for filenames, 'check_pid' verifies if a process exists using kill system call, and 'get_base_name' creates a filename with a hash. All functions perform standard operations without any malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities. No external network communication, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms are evident. Use of system calls is limited to process checking and is appropriate for system-level tasks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no signs of malware or security risks. It performs straightforward utility functions without external communication or malicious intent.",
