  "purpose": "Utility functions for string sanitization, process checking, and filename generation.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external or untrusted input directly; they operate on function arguments provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform insecure operations or write data to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flows from source to sink within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; functions perform standard utility operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'slugify' sanitizes strings for filenames; 'check_pid' verifies if a process exists by PID; 'get_base_name' creates a filename component using hashed and slugified name. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted data handling or insecure practices. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common operations securely without external data dependencies or malicious intent.",
