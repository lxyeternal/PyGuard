  "purpose": "Utility functions for string sanitization, process existence checking, and filename generation.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments: 'value' in slugify, 'pid' in check_pid, 'name' in get_base_name.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from arguments to processing functions; no external data sources or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation observed. Use of standard libraries and functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: 'slugify' sanitizes strings for filesystem use, 'check_pid' verifies process existence by PID, and 'get_base_name' generates a filename using a hash. All functions utilize standard, well-known Python libraries. No network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions intended for normal application operations without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
