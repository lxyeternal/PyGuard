  "purpose": "Commented-out import statements, likely for module functionality related to trace analysis and examples.",
  "sources": "None (imports are commented out, so no active data reading).",
  "sinks": "None, as there is no executable code or data flow.",
  "flows": "None, since the code does not execute any functions or data transfers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out import statements may indicate incomplete code or intentional obfuscation, but on its own, this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements that are entirely commented out. No active code or data processing occurs. The commented code does not execute or interact with untrusted data, and no suspicious patterns or embedded malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is inert, with only commented import statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be either a placeholder or temporarily disabled code.",
