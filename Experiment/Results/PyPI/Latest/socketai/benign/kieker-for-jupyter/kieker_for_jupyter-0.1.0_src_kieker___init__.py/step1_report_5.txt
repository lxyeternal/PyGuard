  "purpose": "Commented-out import statements for modules likely related to trace analysis and example tools.",
  "sources": "No active code that reads input or data; only commented-out import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points present in commented-out code.",
  "flows": "No active code to establish data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code; no executable logic present. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two commented-out import statements. There are no active functions, data processing, or network interactions. The comments suggest potential references to modules for trace analysis and example tools, but these are inactive. Since there is no executable or data-handling code, no malicious behavior, data leaks, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive and contains only commented-out import statements with no executable or malicious content. No security risks or malware are detected.",
