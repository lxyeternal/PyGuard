  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for importing modules related to trace analysis and example tools, likely for debugging, analysis, or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules '.tools.trace_analysis' and 'tools.example' (commented out).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present as the code is commented out and only involves import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present because the import statements are inactive (commented out).",
  "anomalies": "All code is commented out, indicating it is inactive. No suspicious or unusual behavior is observable from the commented code alone.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements, both commented out. This suggests either incomplete code, intentional disabling, or placeholders. There are no active operations, data processing, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any data reads or untrusted operations in its current state.",
  "conclusion": "This code is inactive, with no operational or malicious behavior present. It appears to be placeholders or remnants of previous code. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
