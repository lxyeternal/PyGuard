  "purpose": "The code contains only commented-out import statements, serving as placeholders or deprecated code snippets.",
  "sources": "Commented import statements referencing internal modules (.tools.trace_analysis, tools.example).",
  "sinks": "No active code; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code is inactive and commented out.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only commented-out import statements with no executable code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented import statements, indicating inactive or placeholder code. There are no active code paths, data processing, or behaviors that could lead to security issues. The comments do not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, inactive nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that the code is harmless. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the code as inactive, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's state. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
