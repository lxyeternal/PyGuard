  "purpose": "The code appears to be a commented-out import of modules related to trace analysis and example tools, likely for debugging or development purposes.",
  "sources": "The commented-out import statements, which would load modules from local or package paths.",
  "sinks": "No active code or data handling, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No executable flow since the code is commented out; if uncommented, would involve module imports.",
  "anomalies": "All import statements are commented out; no active code or suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented import statements referencing modules within the same package or project. There are no active instructions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The imports suggest potential development or debugging code, but as they are commented out, they pose no security risk or malicious behavior. There is no indication of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be remnants of development or debugging, with no active malicious behavior or security concerns.",
