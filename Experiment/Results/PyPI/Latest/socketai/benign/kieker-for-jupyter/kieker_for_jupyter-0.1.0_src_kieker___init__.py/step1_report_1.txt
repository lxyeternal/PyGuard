  "anomalies": "Imports are commented out, indicating the code does not execute any import logic; no anomalies detected in active code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented import statements referencing internal modules. There is no executable code, no data processing, no user input, and no data flows. The comments do not indicate malicious intent, nor do they contain obfuscated or suspicious code. The commented nature suggests either deprecated, placeholder, or intentionally disabled code. No suspicious behavior or malware presence is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is inactive and contains only commented import statements. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be benign placeholder or deprecated code.",
