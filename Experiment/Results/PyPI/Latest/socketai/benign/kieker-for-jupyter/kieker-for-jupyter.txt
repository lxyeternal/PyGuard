      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for trace analysis and visualization with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, which should be addressed by sanitizing inputs or avoiding 'shell=True' in future revisions. Overall, the code is safe in its current form, with a low to moderate security risk primarily due to command execution practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward command string builder. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection if the output is used improperly downstream. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential data transmission, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and possible external communication. The overall threat level remains low to moderate, warranting continued monitoring but not outright rejection."
