{
  "purpose": "A utility class for building command-line strings by appending parts incrementally.",
  "sources": "Input data is added via the 'add' method, which takes a string parameter.",
  "sinks": "The 'to_string' method concatenates parts into a single command string; potential risk if untrusted input is added.",
  "flows": "Input from 'add' method flows into the internal '_parts' list, which is later joined in 'to_string'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No dynamic execution, no network activity, no data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward command builder that accumulates string parts and joins them with line continuation characters. It does not perform any execution, network activity, or data processing beyond string concatenation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities like injection, since it merely stores and concatenates strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for building command-line commands. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It should be safe as a utility component, assuming proper usage.",
