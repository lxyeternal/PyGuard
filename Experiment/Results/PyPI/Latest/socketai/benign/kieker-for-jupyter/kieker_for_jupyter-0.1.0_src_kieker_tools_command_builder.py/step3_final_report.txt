  "purpose": "A utility class for building command-line strings by appending parts and converting them into a formatted string with line continuations.",
  "sources": "The add() method receives string parts; the to_string() method reads the accumulated parts.",
  "sinks": "The output of to_string() could be used downstream in command execution contexts, potentially leading to command injection if untrusted input is included.",
  "flows": "Input strings added via add() flow into the internal _parts list, which is then joined into a command string by to_string(). If this string is executed in a shell without sanitization, injection risks exist.",
  "anomalies": "The code does nothing unusual; it is a straightforward string builder. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple utility that accumulates string parts and joins them with line continuation characters. It does not perform execution, sanitization, or obfuscation. The security concern depends on downstream usage—if the output is passed directly to a shell or command interpreter without validation, command injection could occur. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential misuse in an insecure context. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward command string builder. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection if the output is used improperly downstream. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
