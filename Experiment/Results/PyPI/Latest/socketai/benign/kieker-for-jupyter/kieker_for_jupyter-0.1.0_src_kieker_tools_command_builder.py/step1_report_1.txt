  "purpose": "A utility class for constructing command-line strings by appending parts incrementally.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'add' method parameter 'part'.",
  "sinks": "The final command string generated by 'to_string', which could potentially be executed in a shell environment.",
  "flows": "Input 'part' from the 'add' method flows into the '_parts' list, which is joined into a command string by 'to_string'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses straightforward string manipulation without any dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple interface for building command-line commands by accumulating parts. There is no direct execution or unsafe handling of inputs within this code. However, if the generated command string is executed externally (not shown here), it could pose a risk of command injection depending on how 'to_string' output is used. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present within this code snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic command builder with no apparent malicious intent. Its security impact depends entirely on how the produced command string is used downstream. The implementation itself appears safe and straightforward.",
