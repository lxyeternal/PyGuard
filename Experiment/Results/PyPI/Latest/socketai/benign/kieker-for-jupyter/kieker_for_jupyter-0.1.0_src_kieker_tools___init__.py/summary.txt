  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential data transmission, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and possible external communication. The overall threat level remains low to moderate, warranting continued monitoring but not outright rejection."
