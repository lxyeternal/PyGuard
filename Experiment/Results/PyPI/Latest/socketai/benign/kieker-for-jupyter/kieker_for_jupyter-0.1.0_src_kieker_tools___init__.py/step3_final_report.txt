  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, external communication functions, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation patterns, data transmission points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, data storage, environment variables, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or code execution points leading to sinks like network transmission or data storage, potentially indicating malicious data exfiltration or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.7), potential external data transmission, complex code structures without clear purpose, absence of code confirmation for suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks provided snippets, but the suspicion of obfuscation and data transmission suggests possible malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (0.7) aligns with suspicion but cannot be confirmed without code. Malware suspicion (0.3) is moderate, reflecting potential privacy concerns. Other reports with no code or clear suspicious patterns appropriately assign low scores. Overall, the evidence points to cautious suspicion without definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential data transmission, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and possible external communication. The overall threat level remains low to moderate, warranting continued monitoring but not outright rejection.",
