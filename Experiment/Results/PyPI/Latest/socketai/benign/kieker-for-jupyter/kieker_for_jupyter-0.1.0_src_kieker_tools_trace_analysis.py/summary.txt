  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for trace analysis and visualization with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, which should be addressed by sanitizing inputs or avoiding 'shell=True' in future revisions. Overall, the code is safe in its current form, with a low to moderate security risk primarily due to command execution practices."
