  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement of functions from a local module (`cross_style_plots`).\n- No untrusted data handling, external network activity, or code execution is mentioned.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement. There are **no issues** present in the code itself.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation detected based on the provided snippets.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the clear, simple nature of the code.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is only an import statement with no suspicious behavior, the risk score should remain **0**.\n- The malware score is also correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If this import is part of a larger codebase, security considerations should focus on the overall project rather than this snippet.\n- The reports are thorough and do not overstate the risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code snippets are benign import statements with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as is.",
