  "purpose": "Import functions cross_plot and double_cross_plot from a local module cross_style_plots.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module cross_style_plots.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Import statement directly loads functions from local module; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of functions from a local module, typical in Python projects. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
