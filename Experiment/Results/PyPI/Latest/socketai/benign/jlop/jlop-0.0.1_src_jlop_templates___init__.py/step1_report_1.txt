{
  "purpose": "Import functions 'cross_plot' and 'double_cross_plot' from a local module 'cross_style_plots' to use in the current script for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'cross_style_plots' from the current package, importing specific functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet, as it only performs a local import.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions from a local module, with no data processing or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated elements. It simply imports functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of functions from a local module, which is typical in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The snippet is too small to assess for supply chain risks beyond the basic import statement, which is common and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger project that uses plotting functions. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
