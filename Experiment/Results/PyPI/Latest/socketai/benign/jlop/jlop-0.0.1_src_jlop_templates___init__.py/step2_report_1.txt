  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement of functions from a local module named `cross_style_plots`.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or code execution is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for Python projects.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Straightforward import, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.9). Still no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard import, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, minimal and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, safe import statement.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is just an import statement, there's no reason to assign any higher scores. The assessments are consistent with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the current scores.** The code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
