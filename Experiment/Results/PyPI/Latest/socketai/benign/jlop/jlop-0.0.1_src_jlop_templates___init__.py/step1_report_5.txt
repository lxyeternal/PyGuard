  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'cross_plot' and 'double_cross_plot' from a local module 'cross_style_plots'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'cross_style_plots' and imports specific functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions from a local module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import statement from a relative module. It does not contain any input handling, external data access, or suspicious code patterns. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior is evident in this small snippet. The structure and format are standard for Python imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project where these functions are used, but on its own, it presents no security concerns.",
