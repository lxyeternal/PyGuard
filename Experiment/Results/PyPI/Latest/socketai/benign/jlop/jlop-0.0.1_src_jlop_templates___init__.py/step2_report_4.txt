  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement of functions from a local module (`cross_style_plots`).\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or code execution is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code snippets are minimal and typical for Python projects.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .cross_style_plots import cross_plot, double_cross_plot\n     ```\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident here.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws are apparent; they accurately conclude no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - Their conclusions are sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the entire context, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a normal import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
