  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the codebase:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement from a local module `cross_style_plots`. There are no signs of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly identify the code as a straightforward import with no suspicious activity. They do not overlook any potential issues, and their reasoning appears sound given the minimal code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or security concern that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely an import statement, typical in Python projects.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since no malicious activity is indicated—no code injection, no network activity, no suspicious behavior—the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unfounded assumptions. They recognize that the code is a standard import statement with no security implications.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the extremely minimal nature of this code snippet, there is no indication of supply chain risk or malicious intent. It is a standard import statement typical in modular Python projects.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- The current scores are appropriate.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided reports and analysis, I agree with the assigned scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0. The code poses no security concern.",
