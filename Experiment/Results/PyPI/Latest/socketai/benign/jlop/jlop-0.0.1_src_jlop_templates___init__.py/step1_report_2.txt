  "purpose": "Import specific plotting functions from a local module named cross_style_plots.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just imports local functions.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious patterns; only a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement from a local module, which does not involve any input, data processing, or external communication. It neither handles untrusted data nor performs any actions that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard import typical in Python projects for modularity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
