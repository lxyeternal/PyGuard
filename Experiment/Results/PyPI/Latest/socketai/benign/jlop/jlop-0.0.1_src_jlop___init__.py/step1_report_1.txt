{
  "purpose": "The package modifies the default behavior of matplotlib's errorbar functions to customize plot styles.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata (__author__, __version__), imports from local modules, and modifies matplotlib's errorbar functions.",
  "sinks": "Overrides plt.errorbar and plt.Axes.errorbar to enforce custom styling parameters.",
  "flows": "Code executes during import, replacing standard errorbar functions with custom versions that set default styling options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of function overriding is typical for customization but could potentially mask original behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package metadata and customizes matplotlib's errorbar functions by overriding them to set default styling options. It imports local modules, which are not provided for review but seem to serve styling purposes. The function overrides are straightforward, using setdefault to ensure certain styling parameters. No external data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security-related risks are evident. The modifications appear benign, aimed at improving visualization defaults.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless customization of matplotlib's errorbar functions intended for improved plotting aesthetics. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk evident. The overriding of functions is a common pattern in customization libraries and does not pose security threats.",
