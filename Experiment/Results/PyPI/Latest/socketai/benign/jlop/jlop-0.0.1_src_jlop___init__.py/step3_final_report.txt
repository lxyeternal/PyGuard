{
  "purpose": "The code customizes matplotlib's errorbar functions to set default styling parameters for improved visual consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local function definitions and modifies matplotlib's errorbar functions.",
  "sinks": "Overrides plt.errorbar and plt.Axes.errorbar to enforce style defaults; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Source definitions are stored, then used within custom functions which replace the original errorbar functions, applying default styling before calling the original implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The modifications are purely cosmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code captures original matplotlib errorbar functions, defines custom functions to set default style parameters, and replaces the original functions with these. This is a standard pattern for styling customization. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and benign, aimed solely at visual consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign styling override for matplotlib's errorbar functions, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0. The security risk is minimal; a score of 0 is justified given the code's purpose and behavior.",
