{
  "purpose": "To modify and override the default behavior of the matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar function and its Axes method to customize plotting styles.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __author__ and __version__ variables; imports from local modules (load_style, colors); and accesses matplotlib.pyplot and matplotlib.axes for method overriding.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns new functions to plt.errorbar and plt.Axes.errorbar, replacing original methods with custom implementations.",
  "flows": "The code reassigns plt.errorbar to _custom_errorbar, which internally calls the original errorbar via plt._default_errorbar. Similarly, plt.Axes.errorbar calls self._default_errorbar, which is set to the original errorbar method. These modifications are confined within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The method overrides serve to enforce plotting styles, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining package metadata (__author__, __version__). It then imports functions from local modules. It proceeds to override matplotlib's errorbar methods to enforce specific styles for plots. The original errorbar methods are saved to attributes _default_errorbar to preserve functionality. The new functions set default styling parameters and then call the original methods. The code appears to be a customization of plotting behavior with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no external data sources, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code’s structure is straightforward, with clear purpose and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate customization of matplotlib plotting functions aimed at enforcing style consistency. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
