{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the default behavior of matplotlib's errorbar functions for plotting aesthetics and imports package components.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads configuration from internal variables and imports modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only redefines existing functions with preset parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The function overwrites are straightforward customizations.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata, imports functions, and then overrides matplotlib's errorbar methods with custom functions that set default parameters for styling. The overrides are applied at the module level, altering the default plotting behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious code. The modifications are purely cosmetic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign customization of matplotlib plotting functions for visual consistency. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
