{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create stylized cross plots and double cross plots using matplotlib, with configurable axes, ticks, labels, and directional annotations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as axis limits, labels, tick settings, and angle/direction parameters for plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated figures, axis styling, and annotations are the output; no untrusted data is written or transmitted, and there are no file or network operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs and function parameters flow into plotting functions, which produce visualizations. There are no external data flows to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try-except block to set a custom matplotlib style 'jlop', with fallback, which is benign. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and appears typical for plotting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visualization functions for creating styled plots with configurable axes, labels, and directional lines. No external data reading beyond parameters occurs; no data is transmitted externally. The style 'jlop' is attempted but not suspicious; fallback is handled gracefully. No network, file, or hidden behaviors are present. No signs of malicious or maliciously intended operations are evident. The functions do not manipulate environment variables or handle sensitive data. The code appears to be for visualization purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for plotting and visualization tasks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
