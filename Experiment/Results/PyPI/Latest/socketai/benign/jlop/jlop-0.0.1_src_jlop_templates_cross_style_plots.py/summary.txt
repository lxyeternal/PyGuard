  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The attempt to load a custom style is handled safely and does not introduce any threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (~0.1) due to the style fallback handling."
