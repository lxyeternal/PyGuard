{
  "purpose": "This code manages and applies different plotting styles and fonts for matplotlib visualizations, allowing dynamic style changes based on predefined style configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads style identifiers from function arguments, accesses font files from the local filesystem, and loads style files from local directories.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to matplotlib's rcParams, adds font files to the font manager, and sets style configurations via matplotlib's style.use.",
  "flows": "Input style parameter -> Validation against predefined styles -> Loading font files and style files from local directories -> Applying font and style to matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Font files and style files are loaded from local directories; no hardcoded secrets or external data sources involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines style configurations with font file paths and style files, and functions to set these styles in matplotlib. It performs validation on style names, loads font files from local 'fonts' directory, and style files from local 'styles' directory, then applies these settings to matplotlib. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward configuration management for matplotlib styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign style management script for matplotlib with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It securely loads local resources and applies styles as intended, with no signs of suspicious behavior.",
