{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions to set different visualization styles and fonts for matplotlib plots by loading font files and style configuration files.",
  "sources": "The code reads font files from a local 'fonts' directory and style files from a local 'styles' directory based on the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with matplotlib's font manager and style system; no untrusted input or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The functions load font and style files from local paths and set them in matplotlib configuration, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected; the font and style files are loaded from local directories, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a dictionary of style configurations pointing to local font and style files. The 'set_style' function validates the style name and calls helper functions to load fonts and styles. Font files are added to matplotlib via 'addfont', and style files are applied using 'plt.style.use'. All operations involve local file paths derived from the script's directory, with no external data or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code performs standard operations to customize plot styles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward style configuration utility for matplotlib, loading fonts and styles from local directories without any malicious intent or security risks.",
