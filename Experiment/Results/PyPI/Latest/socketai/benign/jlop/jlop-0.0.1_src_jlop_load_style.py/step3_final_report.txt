  "purpose": "Manage and apply matplotlib styles using local font and style files with validation.",
  "sources": "Local font files in 'fonts' directory and style files in 'styles' directory.",
  "sinks": "Application of font and style settings via matplotlib's API; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Validation of style name -> loading font file from local directory -> setting font in matplotlib -> loading style file from local directory -> applying style to matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on local files is standard but could be risky if files are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation and resource loading from local directories, with no dynamic code execution or external dependencies. It correctly validates style names, loads font files, and applies styles using matplotlib's API. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. The only potential concern is if local font/style files are maliciously altered, but this is outside the scope of static analysis and depends on environment trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's straightforward functionality and local resource loading.",
