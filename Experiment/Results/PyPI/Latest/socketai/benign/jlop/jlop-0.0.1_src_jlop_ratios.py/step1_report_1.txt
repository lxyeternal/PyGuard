  "purpose": "Calculate specific ratios and figure sizes based on a custom mathematical function.",
  "sources": "Input values for the metalic_mean function calls (constants 1, 2, 3).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data; all operations are based on hardcoded constants.",
  "flows": "Input constants are processed through the metalic_mean function to produce ratios; no flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs simple mathematical calculations and assigns constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a modified mean, then calculates three ratios based on fixed integer inputs. It then calculates figure widths for papers. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. All operations are straightforward mathematical calculations with hardcoded values.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for mathematical and layout calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
