  "purpose": "Calculate specific ratios related to metallic means for figure sizing, likely for scientific or graphical purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data: None; the code uses hardcoded numeric inputs (1, 2, 3) within the function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation. The function and calculations are straightforward and mathematical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a mathematical library (numpy) and defines a function 'metallic_mean' that computes a specific formula involving square roots. It then calculates three ratios using fixed inputs: 1, 2, and 3. These are used for figure sizing, as indicated by variable names. The calculations are standard mathematical operations with no signs of malicious intent. The code structure is clear, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple mathematical calculations to derive ratios for figure sizes. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be safe and purpose-driven for graphical or formatting purposes.",
