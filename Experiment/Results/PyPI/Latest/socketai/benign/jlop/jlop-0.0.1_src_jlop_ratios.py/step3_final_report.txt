  "purpose": "Calculate metallic ratios (golden, silver, bronze) using a mathematical function for layout sizing.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded inputs (1, 2, 3) used as arguments to the 'metalic_mean' function.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data leaks; calculations are self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input constants (1, 2, 3) flow into 'metalic_mean' function, which computes ratios used for figure sizes.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in function name 'metalic_mean' instead of 'metallic_mean'; no malicious or obfuscating code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple mathematical function to compute ratios based on input 'n'. It uses fixed inputs to generate ratios named after precious metals, likely for layout purposes. The code involves no external data, network activity, or obfuscation. The misspelling of 'metalic_mean' is a minor typo, not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores as 0. The code's straightforwardness and lack of malicious patterns confirm its safety. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for calculating ratios, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor typo does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity. The overall assessment and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
