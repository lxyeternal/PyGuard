{
  "purpose": "Calculate specific ratios based on a mathematical mean function, likely for setting figure sizes in papers.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; all values are hardcoded or computed internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'metalic_mean' is a misspelling of 'metallic_mean', but this is likely a typographical error rather than malicious obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of numpy is standard and harmless in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute a mean related to the golden ratio, using numpy for square root calculations. It calculates ratios named after precious metals. The code then sets figure widths based on these ratios. No external input, no network communication, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic are present. The function is straightforward and mathematically consistent. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple mathematical calculations with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security vulnerabilities. It appears to be utility code for figure sizing, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
