{
  "purpose": "Calculate specific ratios (golden, silver, bronze) using a custom mathematical function, and define figure sizes for papers.",
  "sources": "The function 'metallic_mean' uses input values 1, 2, and 3 to compute ratios; these inputs are hardcoded and serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks such as network calls, file writes, or sensitive data exposure points in the code.",
  "flows": "Input values 1, 2, 3 are processed through 'metallic_mean' to produce ratios; these ratios are stored in variables but not used further within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual language features, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward mathematical calculation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for mathematical operations, defines a function to compute a metallic mean based on an input 'n', and calculates three ratios with fixed inputs. It also sets figure width variables using simple arithmetic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. All operations are mathematical and static, with no external communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical utility to compute ratios and figure dimensions. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies.",
