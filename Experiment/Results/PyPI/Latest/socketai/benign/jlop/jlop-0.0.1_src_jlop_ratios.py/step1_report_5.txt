  "purpose": "Calculate and define ratios related to metallic means and figure widths for papers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function 'metallic_mean' (values 1, 2, 3).",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "Input values (1, 2, 3) flow into 'metallic_mean' to compute ratios; no further data flows or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The calculation appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for mathematical calculations, defines a function to compute a metallic mean based on an input 'n', and uses it to define golden, silver, and bronze ratios. It also calculates figure widths based on fixed decimal values. No untrusted data input, no external network connections, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The function's calculations are standard mathematical operations, and the variables are constants related to common geometric ratios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to serve a purpose related to mathematical or graphical configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It is a benign code snippet used for ratio calculations.",
