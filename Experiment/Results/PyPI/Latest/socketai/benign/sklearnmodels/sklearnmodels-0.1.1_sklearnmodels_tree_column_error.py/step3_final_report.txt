  "purpose": "Implementation of decision tree splitters for numeric and nominal features, used in machine learning models to partition data based on feature values.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas DataFrame columns, specifically x[column], and unique values for splitting criteria.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or malicious data flows; data is processed internally within the application.",
  "flows": "Source: Data extraction from DataFrame; Sink: Computation of split errors and selection of optimal split points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for splitting data in decision trees, including numeric and nominal splitters. It utilizes standard libraries (numpy, pandas, pyarrow) for data handling. The get_values method filters NaNs and subsamples data for efficiency. The optimize method evaluates potential splits based on a provided metric, and callbacks allow for evaluation during split optimization. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is consistent with typical ML utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of decision tree splitters with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
