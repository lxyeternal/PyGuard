{
  "purpose": "This code defines various error metrics and target-related classes for use in machine learning models, particularly classification and regression.",
  "sources": "Input data `y` in methods like `__call__`, `prediction`, and `average_split` functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing points where untrusted data could influence calculations, primarily in the `prediction` and `__call__` methods.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into methods such as `__call__` and `prediction`, which then process the data to produce error metrics or probability distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or malicious intent observed. The code uses standard libraries and practices for ML metric calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`) and defines abstract base classes for error calculations, along with specific implementations for classification and regression errors. It processes input arrays for metrics calculation, with no indication of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or backdoors. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data leaks. The methods focus solely on statistical computations related to ML models.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of machine learning error metrics and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical component for model evaluation purposes.",
