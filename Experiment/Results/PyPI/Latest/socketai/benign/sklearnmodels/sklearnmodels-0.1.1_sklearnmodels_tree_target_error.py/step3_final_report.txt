{
  "purpose": "Implementation of various target error metrics (entropy, Gini, deviation) for machine learning models, used to evaluate model performance.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input numpy arrays or pandas Series passed to methods such as __call__ and prediction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present; computations are purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into prediction and __call__ methods, with results used for error calculations; no external data or system calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "In-place modification in the log() function with 'x[x < eps] = eps' could be considered a side effect but is a common numpy pattern for numerical stability; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ML error metrics with no external data access, network calls, or malicious patterns. The only noteworthy technical aspect is in-place modification in the log() function, which is typical for numpy to prevent log(0) errors. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose. The code is straightforward, uses common libraries, and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of ML target error metrics with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
