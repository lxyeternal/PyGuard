{
  "purpose": "The code defines various target error classes for classification and regression tasks, including methods for prediction, error calculation, and entropy/logarithm functions, likely used in decision trees or similar models.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arrays `y` for predictions and error calculations. No external data sources or input functions are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, networks, or files. It performs mathematical operations on input data, returning computed results.",
  "flows": "Input `y` flows into prediction and error calculation functions, which process data and return numerical results. There are no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard mathematical and data processing libraries without obfuscation, hidden code, or hidden data leaks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for error measurement in machine learning models. It uses standard Python libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`) for numerical computations and data processing. The functions and classes are straightforward, performing typical calculations such as entropy, Gini impurity, and mean deviations. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The logarithm function manages small values to avoid domain errors, and the classes implement expected interfaces for error metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of error metrics for classification and regression tasks in machine learning, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
