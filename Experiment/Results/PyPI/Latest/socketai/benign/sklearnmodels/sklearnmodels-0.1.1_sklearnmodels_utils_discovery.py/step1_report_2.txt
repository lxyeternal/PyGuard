{
  "purpose": "Utilities to discover estimators, displays, and functions from the sklearnmodels package, filtering out test modules and abstract classes.",
  "sources": "import_module calls, pkgutil.walk_packages, inspect.getmembers, attribute access on classes and functions, __file__ for package root",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or used in unsafe commands.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported dynamically via import_module, then classes and functions are inspected and collected based on filtering criteria.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; dynamic imports and reflection are standard for discovery utilities and pose no immediate threat.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically discovers classes and functions within the sklearnmodels package, filtering based on inheritance and naming conventions. It ignores test modules and abstract classes, and sorts results for reproducibility. Use of import_module and inspect functions are typical for plugin-like architectures. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network communication, system modification, or obfuscation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate discovery utility for sklearnmodels, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard Python reflection and module inspection methods. The design is consistent with package utility functions and does not perform any harmful operations.",
