{
  "purpose": "Utility module to discover and list estimators, displays, and functions within the 'sklearnmodels' package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules dynamically using 'import_module' and 'pkgutil.walk_packages', and inspects modules to identify classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; data is gathered from trusted package modules and returned as structured lists. No data leakage or untrusted output handling is present.",
  "flows": "Dynamically imports modules, inspects them for classes/functions, filters based on inheritance or naming conventions, and returns sorted lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. Uses standard inspection and module import techniques. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic discovery of classes and functions within the 'sklearnmodels' package directory, filtering out test modules and private members. It uses standard library functions for module iteration, inspection, and sorting. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The operations are typical for plugin discovery mechanisms. The usage of importlib and inspect is standard and safe. No signs of malicious backdoors, cryptomining, or covert data theft are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for module discovery with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within trusted modules and employs common inspection techniques. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected.",
