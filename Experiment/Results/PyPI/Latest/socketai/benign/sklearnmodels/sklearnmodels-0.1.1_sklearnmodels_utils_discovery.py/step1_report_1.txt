  "purpose": "Utility functions to discover and list estimators, displays, and functions within the sklearnmodels package for dynamic inspection and filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports modules dynamically using import_module, walks package directories with pkgutil.walk_packages, inspects classes and functions via inspect.getmembers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from dynamically imported modules and classes, but no direct sinks for untrusted input or network activities are present.",
  "flows": "Dynamically imports modules → inspects classes/functions → filters based on inheritance or naming → returns sorted lists of discovered objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of dynamic import and inspection is standard for discovery utilities. No malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically walks through package modules, imports them, and inspects their classes and functions. It filters classes based on inheritance (from scikit-learn base classes) and naming conventions. It also filters functions based on module origin and name. The overall structure and functions align with standard dynamic discovery practices. No signs of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or covert backdoors, are present. All operations are confined to static inspection, filtering, and listing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate package introspection to list estimators, displays, and functions. It adheres to expected patterns for plugin discovery and filtering without any malicious intent or security risks.",
