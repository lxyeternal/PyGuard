  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign discovery utility with a moderate security risk stemming from unvalidated dynamic imports. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be approximately 0.6 to reflect the potential for malicious code execution during module importation in untrusted environments."
