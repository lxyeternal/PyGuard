  "sources": "Module walking with pkgutil, dynamic import with import_module, class and function inspection with inspect",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential risk in dynamic importation if modules are malicious",
  "flows": "Walk modules -> import modules -> inspect classes/functions -> filter and list",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard reflection techniques used",
  "analysis": "The code performs static discovery of classes and functions in the package, filtering out test modules and abstract classes. It relies on dynamic importation of modules, which could execute malicious code if modules are compromised. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the lack of validation during import, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. The code itself is benign, but the approach introduces potential risk if malicious modules are present. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this understanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign discovery utility with a moderate security risk stemming from unvalidated dynamic imports. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be approximately 0.6 to reflect the potential for malicious code execution during module importation in untrusted environments.",
