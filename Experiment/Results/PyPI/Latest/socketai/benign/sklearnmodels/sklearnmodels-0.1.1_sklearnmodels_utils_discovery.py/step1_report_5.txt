{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities to discover estimators, displays, and functions from the 'sklearnmodels' package, filtering and organizing classes and functions based on certain criteria.",
  "sources": "Module imports (inspect, pkgutil, import_module, Path), package directory traversal, dynamic module loading, class and function inspection",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed as sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily loads modules, inspects classes/functions, and returns lists",
  "flows": "Modules are discovered via walking packages; classes/functions are imported and inspected; results are accumulated and returned after filtering",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Uses standard import and inspection techniques, no obfuscated or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic discovery of classes and functions within a package by walking through modules and inspecting their contents. It filters classes to exclude abstract or test-related classes, and filters functions based on module and naming conventions. All module interactions are standard, and no suspicious data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code’s intent appears purely for utility and discovery within the package's ecosystem.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for module discovery and filtering, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses typical Python practices for reflection and module inspection, with no anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
