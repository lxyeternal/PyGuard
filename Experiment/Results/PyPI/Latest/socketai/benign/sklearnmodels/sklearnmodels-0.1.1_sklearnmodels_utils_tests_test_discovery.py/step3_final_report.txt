  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions all_estimators, all_displays, and all_functions in the sklearnmodels.utils.discovery module, verifying their outputs and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Function calls to all_estimators(), all_displays(), all_functions() within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on returned list lengths and exception handling for invalid parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to function calls, results checked via assertions, exception handling triggered by invalid input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The import path 'sklearnmodels' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying expected outputs and exception handling for utility functions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The import path is unusual but not inherently malicious. The assertions depend on fixed expected sizes, typical for controlled tests. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The main concern is verifying the package source, but based solely on code, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no security risks are present. The only minor note is the package name, which warrants verification outside this code review.",
