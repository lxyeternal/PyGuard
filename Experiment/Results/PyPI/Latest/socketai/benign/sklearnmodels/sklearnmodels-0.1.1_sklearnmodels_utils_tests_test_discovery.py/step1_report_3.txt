{
  "purpose": "This code contains test functions to verify the behavior of utility functions in the sklearnmodels.utils.discovery module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pytest' and functions from 'sklearnmodels.utils.discovery'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "The code calls utility functions and asserts their outputs; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The import path 'sklearnmodels' may be a custom or alternative package, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code for verifying the number of estimators, displays, and functions returned by utility functions. It includes parameter validation and exception handling. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution. The imports are from standard testing and a specific module, with no suspicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for utility functions related to sklearn models, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
