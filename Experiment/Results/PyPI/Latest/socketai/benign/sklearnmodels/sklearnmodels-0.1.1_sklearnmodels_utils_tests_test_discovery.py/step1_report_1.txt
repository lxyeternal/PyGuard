  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions in the sklearnmodels.utils.discovery module, verifying correct behavior and exception handling.",
  "sources": "import statements for pytest and specific functions from sklearnmodels.utils.discovery",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leak or harmful operations detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; tests invoke functions and check results",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard test code without unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing framework pytest and specific functions from a module, then defines several test functions to verify expected outputs and exception handling. The tests check the number of estimators, displays, and functions returned by the module's functions, and validate error raising for invalid parameters. No network activity, data manipulation, or suspicious logic is present. The code is typical test code for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward test code for validating functions in a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for development/testing purposes only.",
