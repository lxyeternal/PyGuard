{
  "purpose": "This appears to be a template or documentation structure for a Python function or class, meant to specify metadata such as parameters, return values, exceptions, and notes.",
  "sources": "No actual data sources or input reading code present; placeholders suggest documentation placeholders rather than executable code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, or external communication identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways exist as this is only a documentation template with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder templates with double curly braces may suggest code generation or templating system, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only template placeholders for documenting Python functions or classes, with no executable code, data handling, or external interactions. The structure indicates a focus on documentation or code generation rather than operational logic. Since no actual code is provided, there are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalous patterns detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a documentation/template skeleton with no executable content or security vulnerabilities. There is no malicious intent, and the risk is negligible. It is likely used for code documentation purposes.",
