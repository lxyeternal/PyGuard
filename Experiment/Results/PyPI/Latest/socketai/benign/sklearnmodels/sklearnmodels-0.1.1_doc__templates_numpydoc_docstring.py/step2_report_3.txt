  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- **Reports 1 & 2:** Both identify the code as a template or documentation stub with placeholders, no executable logic, no data flow, no malicious activity. They assign very high confidence (0.9 and 1.0), with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0.\n\n- **Report 3:** Also recognizes the code as a placeholder/template, but with a slightly lower confidence (0.3), noting potential data sources and sinks but finding no actual code or security issues. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, with a minimal security risk score (0.1).\n\n- **Report 4:** Similar to the above, confirms it's a placeholder/template with placeholders only, no executable code, no malicious patterns, and perfect confidence (1.0). Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0.\n\n- **Report 5:** States no actual code is provided; it's just placeholders. Confidence is 0, indicating no basis for analysis, and all scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a template or documentation stub with placeholders, not executable code. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are identified.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**  \n  No significant logical errors. The reports are consistent and cautious, acknowledging the lack of actual code.\n\n- **Scores and Reasoning:**  \n  The scores for malware and obfuscation are all at 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or suspicious code. The security risk scores are also appropriately low, reflecting the non-functional, documentation-like nature of the code.\n\n- **High Risk or Malware Scores?**  \n  Since there's no actual code, no malware, and no obfuscation, scores of 0 are justified. Any higher would be unreasonable.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as placeholders and avoid speculative security assessments.\n\n- **Score Consistency:**  \n  The scores align well with the described code nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity or code present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risk identified; the code is non-functional documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the nature of the code as a template or documentation stub with only placeholders, there is no basis for assigning any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores above zero. The reports are consistent and cautious, reflecting the actual content accurately.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, non-executable, and serves purely as a structural template.",
