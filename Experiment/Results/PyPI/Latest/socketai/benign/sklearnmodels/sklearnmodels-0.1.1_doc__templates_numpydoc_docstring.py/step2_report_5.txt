  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a template with placeholders, no executable logic, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code contains only placeholders, no actual code or data handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The high confidence (0.9) is justified given the clear absence of executable code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a documentation/template skeleton with placeholders, no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The assessment is accurate; the code is a documentation stub.\n- Confidence is maximal, which aligns with the evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Placeholder with potential data sources and sinks, but no actual logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.3\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1) perhaps due to the mention of data sources and sinks, but no actual data handling or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is low (0.3), which is appropriate given the lack of concrete code.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- The securityRisk score could be reduced to 0, as there's no evidence of actual security concern.\n- The overall conclusion remains that this is a template with minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Adjust securityRisk to 0 for consistency; scores otherwise acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Placeholder code template, no executable logic, no data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Accurate; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is high, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided, only placeholders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Since there's no code, no malicious activity or security issues can be assessed.\n- Confidence is zero, matching the lack of content.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a placeholder/template with no executable or malicious content.\n- The only minor adjustment is in Report 3, where the securityRisk score should be lowered from 0.1 to 0, given the lack of actual data handling or security implications.\n\n### Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of executable code, data handling, or external interactions, the overall security risk remains negligible. I would set this at **0** or very close to it.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a non-functional template with no security concerns.** The only adjustment I recommend is reducing the security risk score in Report 3 to zero for consistency.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-threatening content.",
