{
  "purpose": "The code is a placeholder template with no executable logic or security-sensitive operations.",
  "sources": "No actual data sources; placeholders only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; placeholders do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code contains only static placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, secrets, or obfuscation; only placeholders present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional template with placeholders, lacking any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. Minor risk score in one report (0.1) can be justified as negligible but could be lowered to zero for consistency. Confidence scores are high where applicable, reflecting the lack of actual code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structural template with no malicious or security issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the content. No further adjustments are necessary.",
