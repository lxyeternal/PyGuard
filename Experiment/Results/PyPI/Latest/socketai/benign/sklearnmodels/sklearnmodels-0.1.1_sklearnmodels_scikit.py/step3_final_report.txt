  "purpose": "Custom sklearn-compatible decision tree models for classification and regression, including data validation, transformation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, environment imports, data inputs via fit/predict, external libraries like pyarrow for data conversion.",
  "sinks": "Data validation and transformation, model predictions, export functions; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation and conversion → model training/prediction → export.",
  "anomalies": "Minor anomalies such as commented-out code and local import of pyarrow within functions; no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom decision trees with data validation, transformation, and visualization features. No suspicious system calls, network activity, or malicious code are present. The use of pyarrow is solely for data conversion and is benign. Commented-out code and local imports are benign anomalies. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of custom decision tree models compatible with scikit-learn, with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware. The minor anomalies do not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to minor anomalies like local pyarrow import and commented code.",
