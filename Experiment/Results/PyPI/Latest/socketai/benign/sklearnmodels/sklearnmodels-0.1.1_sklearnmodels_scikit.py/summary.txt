  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of custom decision tree models compatible with scikit-learn, with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware. The minor anomalies do not pose security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to minor anomalies like local pyarrow import and commented code."
