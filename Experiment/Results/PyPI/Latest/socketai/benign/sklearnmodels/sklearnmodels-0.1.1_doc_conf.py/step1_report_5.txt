  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs to sensitive functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines configuration variables for Sphinx documentation, imports standard modules (os, sys), and dynamically retrieves the package version via get_version. There are no network calls, data manipulations, or execution of untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. All imports and functions used are standard and safe. The code structure and content are typical for a Sphinx configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines settings for documentation generation.",
