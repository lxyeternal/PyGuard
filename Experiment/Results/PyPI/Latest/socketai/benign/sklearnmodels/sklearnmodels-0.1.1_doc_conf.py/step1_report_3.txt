  "purpose": "The code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder for the 'sklearnmodels' project.",
  "sources": [
    "import os",
    "import sys",
    "from importlib.metadata import version as get_version"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "get_version('sklearnmodels')",
    "html_theme_options['github_url']",
    "html_context['github_repo']",
    "html_context['github_user']",
    "html_context['github_repo']",

  "flows": [
    "Importing version info via get_version('sklearnmodels')",
    "Using project, author, and version info for documentation",
    "Defining static paths, theme options, and external links for HTML output"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of get_version to dynamically fetch package version (common, not suspicious)",
    "No input reading, user data, or external network activity present",
    "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution",
    "All configurations are static or metadata-based, typical for a Sphinx config"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script setting up documentation parameters, themes, extensions, and intersphinx mappings. No input or output data sources are used in a way that could be exploited; the only dynamic element is fetching the package version via get_version, which is standard practice. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no backdoors, no data exfiltration, and no network connections initiated by the script. The overall structure and content are typical of documentation setup files, with no indication of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified. It simply configures documentation generation for the 'sklearnmodels' project.",
