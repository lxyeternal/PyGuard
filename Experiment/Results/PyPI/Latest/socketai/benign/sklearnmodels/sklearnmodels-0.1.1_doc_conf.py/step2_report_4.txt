  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation.\n- The only dynamic operation is the use of `importlib.metadata.get_version(\"sklearnmodels\")` to retrieve the package version.\n- No external data input, network activity, or command execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and typical for documentation setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of the code:** The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script.\n- **Malicious activity or vulnerabilities:** None are present.\n- **Code correctness:** No issues or anomalies.\n- **External dependencies or network activity:** None.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- No flaws or mistakes are identified in the logic or reasoning.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.get_version` is standard for dynamically fetching package version info.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only potentially \"suspicious\" element is the dynamic version retrieval, but this is a common practice and not malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all findings are based on observed code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0.0**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a benign, static configuration script with no external or dynamic behaviors that could pose security risks. The use of `get_version` is standard and safe. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file. No changes to the scores are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
