  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, themes, and paths.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and importlib.metadata.get_version to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Fetching version info via get_version; static configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard static configuration with dynamic version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script with standard imports and static settings. The only dynamic element is fetching the package version using get_version, which is a common and safe practice. No external data flows, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. All signals indicate benign, static configuration intended solely for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of get_version is routine, and no external or suspicious activity is detected.",
