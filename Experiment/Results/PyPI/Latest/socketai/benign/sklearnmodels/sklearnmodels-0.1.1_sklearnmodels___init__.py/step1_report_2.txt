{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports components related to decision trees from the local package and exposes certain classes and version info for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module's directory to import 'tree', 'scikit' module components, and version information from '_version'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted input or data. It only defines module-level imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The imports are static and not influenced by external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py file that sets up imports and exports for the package. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The structure and content align with standard open-source library practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes module exports and version info for a Python package.",
