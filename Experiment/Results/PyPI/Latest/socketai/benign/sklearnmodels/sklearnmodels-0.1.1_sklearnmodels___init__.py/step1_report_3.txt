{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an initializer or module aggregator for a scikit-learn contribution package, exposing submodules and classes for classification and regression trees.",
  "sources": "The code imports submodules (.tree), classes from scikit (SKLearnClassificationTree, SKLearnRegressionTree), and version info (__version__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network operations, file writes, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports local modules and classes necessary for the package functionality. It defines __all__ for exports, indicating intended public API. No code execution based on external input, no hidden behaviors, and no malicious logic detected. The presence of author/license comments suggests open-source distribution with proper licensing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation detected. It simply organizes and exposes package components.",
