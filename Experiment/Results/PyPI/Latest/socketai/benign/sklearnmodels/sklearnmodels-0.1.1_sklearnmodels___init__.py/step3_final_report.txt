  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and exposing specific classes and version information for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.tree, .scikit, ._version) and the definition of __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, performing straightforward imports and defining the public API. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity. The structure is typical and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All indicators point to a safe, well-structured package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign status.",
