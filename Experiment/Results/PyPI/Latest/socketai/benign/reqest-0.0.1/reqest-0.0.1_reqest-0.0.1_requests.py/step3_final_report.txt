  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, command-line arguments, hardcoded strings, user inputs, external network sources.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, subprocess calls, file writes, system commands, environment modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment) into sinks (network, system), potentially via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), misleading variable names, hardcoded credentials, encrypted or encoded strings, suspicious network addresses, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 5 contain no code, correctly scored as zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. Report 2 shows obfuscation, dynamic execution, and untrusted input handling, leading to moderate suspicion (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.5). Report 3 depicts straightforward, benign code with no obfuscation or malicious signs, scored accordingly (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2). Report 4 exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity: obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, encrypted strings, and ambiguous variable names, warranting high scores (malware=0.8, obfuscated=0.75, securityRisk=0.75). The scoring across reports aligns with their descriptions and observed features, with no adjustments necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores are consistent with the provided descriptions and observed code features. Reports 1 and 5 correctly indicate no issues. Report 3 is benign. Reports 2 and 4 show suspicion and potential malicious behavior, reflected appropriately in their scores. Overall, the evaluation aligns with standard security analysis practices, and no further modifications are needed.",
