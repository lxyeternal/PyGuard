  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes the classes for signing/verifying, reading headers, and key resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, standard cryptography, no backdoors or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurate description of header parsing, signature creation, and insertion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, very high confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's assessment is consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes the signing and verification flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, uses standard cryptography.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns well with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Properly details the signing and verification processes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or external malicious activities.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly summarizes the code's behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious patterns—no network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports give 0; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical cryptographic handling and header validation, not a significant security concern.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP message signing and verification.\n- No malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage detected.\n- The cryptographic practices and header handling are appropriate and secure.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard cryptographic handling, minor risks related to header validation, but nothing critical)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears secure and legitimate. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
