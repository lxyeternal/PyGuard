  "purpose": "Implementation of HTTP message signing and verification using structured headers and cryptographic algorithms.",
  "sources": "Headers such as 'Signature-Input' and 'Signature', cryptographic key resolvers, and message components for signing/verifying.",
  "sinks": "Headers where signatures are inserted ('Signature-Input', 'Signature') and cryptographic key resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Input headers and message components -> signature base construction -> cryptographic signing/verifying -> output headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices for signing and verifying HTTP messages, with proper validation routines and exception handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. It relies on external libraries for structured header parsing and cryptography, which is typical. No suspicious data flows or external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of HTTP message signatures, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard cryptographic handling. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
