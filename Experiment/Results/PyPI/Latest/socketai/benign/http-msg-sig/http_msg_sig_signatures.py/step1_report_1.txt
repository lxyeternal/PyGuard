{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes for signing and verifying HTTP messages using the HTTP Signatures specification, including handling signature creation, validation, and component resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from message headers ('Signature-Input', 'Signature'), message components via resolvers, and cryptographic keys via key resolver.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions to sign and verify messages, updates message headers with signature data.",
  "flows": "Reads message headers and components -> builds signature base -> signs message or verifies signature -> updates headers or raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious header manipulations, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code. Uses standard cryptographic procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for signing and verifying HTTP signatures, handling headers and cryptographic keys securely. No suspicious or malicious logic such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Signature handling and key resolution appear standard. Exception handling is proper for malformed headers or signature verification failures. No indication of data leakage, malicious injections, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of HTTP message signature handling with no apparent malicious intent or security sabotage. It relies on cryptographic libraries and standard practices, with no suspicious data flows or backdoors detected.",
