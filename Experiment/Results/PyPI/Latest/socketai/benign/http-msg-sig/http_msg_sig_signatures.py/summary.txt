  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of HTTP message signatures, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard cryptographic handling. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9)."
