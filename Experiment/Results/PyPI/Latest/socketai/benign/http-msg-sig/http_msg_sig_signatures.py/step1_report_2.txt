{
  "purpose": "This code implements an HTTP message signature signing and verification system using various cryptographic algorithms and structured headers, primarily for securing HTTP messages with digital signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from message headers ('Signature-Input', 'Signature'), message content for signing, and configuration parameters such as keys and algorithms.",
  "sinks": "Writes signature data into message headers ('Signature-Input', 'Signature'), potentially exposing signatures and cryptographic material, but no direct output of untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input headers are parsed to extract signature parameters; message content and header data are used to generate or verify signatures; signatures are then inserted back into message headers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and structures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Exception handling is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for signing and verifying HTTP message signatures, utilizing structured headers and cryptographic algorithms. It performs parameter validation, timestamp checks, and signature creation/validation processes with proper exception handling. No evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The use of cryptography appears legitimate, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. All data flows are consistent with a typical cryptographic signature system for HTTP messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of HTTP message signing and verification with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard cryptographic practices and handles data securely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
