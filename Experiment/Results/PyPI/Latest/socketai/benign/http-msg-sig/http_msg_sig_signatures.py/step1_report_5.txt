{
  "purpose": "This code implements HTTP message signing and verification using digital signatures with support for structured signature parameters and timestamp validation.",
  "sources": "User-provided headers (e.g., 'Signature-Input', 'Signature') and message content passed to sign and verify methods, key resolver resolves private/public keys.",
  "sinks": "Headers where signature and signature input are set, cryptographic signing and verification functions, parsing functions that process headers and message components.",
  "flows": "Input headers and message content -> parse and validate headers -> build signature base -> sign message or verify signature -> update headers with signature data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications observed. Use of timestamp validation is standard; no apparent data exfiltration or malicious code embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing and verification of HTTP messages using structured headers and timestamp validation. It includes functions for parsing headers, constructing signature bases, signing messages with private keys, and verifying signatures with public keys. The code ensures proper validation of timestamps and signature parameters, preventing common replay attacks. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are present. Use of cryptographic algorithms and key resolvers appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code is well-structured and follows typical patterns for HTTP message signature handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP message signing and verification with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses well-understood cryptographic practices and proper validation routines. No suspicious or harmful code segments were detected.",
