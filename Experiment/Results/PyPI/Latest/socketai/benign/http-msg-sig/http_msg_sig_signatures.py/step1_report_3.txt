{
  "purpose": "This code implements HTTP message signing and verification using signature algorithms, handling signature input and signature headers, and ensuring message integrity and authenticity.",
  "sources": "Reads message headers ('Signature-Input', 'Signature'), reads message content in signing and verification processes, reads timestamp parameters ('created', 'expires') during validation.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic signing and verification functions, processes signature parameters, resolves keys via resolvers, and constructs signature bases for signing and verification.",
  "flows": "Source: message headers and message content → build signature base and parameters → sign or verify signature → output or validate signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. No evident obfuscation or unconventional language features. Code uses standard cryptographic and header parsing methods. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for signing and verifying HTTP messages with signatures, utilizing well-structured methods for parsing headers, building signature bases, and performing cryptographic operations. Key resolution is delegated to resolver classes, and standard datetime and header validation is implemented. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The cryptographic operations seem legitimate and follow typical patterns. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are apparent. The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP message signature handling, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate implementation of HTTP message signing and verification, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to standard cryptographic practices and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
