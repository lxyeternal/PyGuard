{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports various internal modules related to HTTP message signing, verification, exceptions, resolvers, algorithms, and structures, and sets a static version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (algorithms, exceptions, resolvers, signatures, structures)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "N/A — static import statements without data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version string assignment, typical for a package's __init__.py. There are no dynamic behaviors, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup file with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are justified and should remain as is, with no adjustments needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
