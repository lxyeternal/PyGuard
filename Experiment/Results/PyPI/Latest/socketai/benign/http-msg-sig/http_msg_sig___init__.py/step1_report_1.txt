{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components related to HTTP message signing, verification, and associated exceptions and structures, likely for use in an API or security-related library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: algorithms, exceptions, resolvers, signatures, and structures",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as all operations are imports and assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard import statements, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from local modules, indicating it is part of a larger package focused on HTTP message signing and verification. No input handling, external network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The version is statically assigned. All statements are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module setup. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscated code, and no signs of sabotage or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with import statements organizing the package's components. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely a legitimate part of a security or API library.",
