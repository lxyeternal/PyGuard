  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes related to HTTP message signing and verification, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from the current package",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no use of untrusted input or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static imports and version assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; standard import structure",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and a version declaration, which are typical for package __init__.py files. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations present. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns. All imported modules and classes appear relevant to HTTP signature handling, with no suspicious or malicious activity evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer file importing necessary components for HTTP signature functionalities. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
