  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple module's __init__.py or setup file, mainly importing components related to HTTP message signing, verification, exceptions, and structures.\n- No external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution are reported.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a high confidence level (1) or near (0.9), indicating they find no malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report suggesting 0.1, but given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimate.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard package setup code, importing modules and defining a version.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The consistent pattern across reports supports the conclusion that this code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, benign part of a security or API library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
