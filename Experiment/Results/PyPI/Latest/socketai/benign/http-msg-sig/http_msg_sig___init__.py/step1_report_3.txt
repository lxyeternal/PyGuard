{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file, mainly importing classes and exceptions from internal submodules for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local submodules: algorithms, exceptions, resolvers, signatures, structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'noqa' comments to suppress linting warnings, which is common, but no unusual or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for module components and setting a version string. There are no runtime data manipulations, no input handling, no network or file operations. The use of relative imports suggests a package structure. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code functions as a simple API surface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer primarily for organizing imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured package component.",
