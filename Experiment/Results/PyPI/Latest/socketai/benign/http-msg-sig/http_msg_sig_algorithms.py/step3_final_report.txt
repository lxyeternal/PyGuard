  "purpose": "Import cryptographic algorithm constants and classes from a local module for use in cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '._algorithms'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import only.",
  "flows": "None; static import without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with a linter suppression comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static import of cryptographic primitives from a local module. No data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The import is standard for cryptography-related modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks are detected. The 'noqa' comment is a common practice to suppress linter warnings, not malicious obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low or zero, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement for cryptographic primitives with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
