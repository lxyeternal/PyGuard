{
  "purpose": "This code imports cryptographic algorithm constants and classes from a local module, likely used for signing, verifying, or cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing from a local module '_algorithms'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; merely importing definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard import statement with noqa comment to ignore linting warnings",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a static import of specific cryptographic algorithms from a local module. It does not process input, handle data, or execute any logic. The imported items are likely constants or classes defining cryptographic methods. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious code inclusion. No external network activity, no credential handling, and no hidden backdoors are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement of cryptographic components with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, standard cryptographic implementation.",
