{
  "purpose": "Import cryptographic algorithm classes and functions from a local module '_algorithms'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '_algorithms'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code fragment; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to perform standard imports. No hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports several cryptographic algorithm classes or functions, likely for use elsewhere in the package. All imported names relate to cryptographic signatures and algorithms, which are standard in security-related code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious data handling within this fragment. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a module that relies on cryptographic primitives.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement for cryptographic components from a local module. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a cryptography or security-related package with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
