  "purpose": "Import cryptographic algorithm constants and classes from a local module for use in security-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module named '_algorithms'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this short import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs a module import without executing any logic or containing hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several cryptographic algorithms and signature classes, likely for use in cryptographic operations. All imported items appear to be standard cryptographic constants and classes, with no indications of malicious behavior. The snippet is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign import statement for cryptographic algorithms, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is standard practice in cryptography-related modules.",
