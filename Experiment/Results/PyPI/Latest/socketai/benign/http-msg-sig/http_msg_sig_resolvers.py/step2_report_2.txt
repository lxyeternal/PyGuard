  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a resolver class for extracting components from HTTP messages, used for signature validation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code performs URL and header parsing with standard libraries.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.  \n- The only minor concern is the placeholder method, which is not malicious.  \n- The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines classes for resolving HTTP signature components, with dynamic method invocation and standard attribute access. Potential risk from untrusted message objects, but no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The dynamic method call via `getattr` is a common pattern, not inherently dangerous here.  \n- No external calls or malicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is justified given potential manipulation if message objects are malicious, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, resolving HTTP message components, with no suspicious code or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Straightforward, safe code.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- Slightly higher confidence, consistent with the code quality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Resolves components and keys, with placeholders for key resolution. No malicious code, just unimplemented methods.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- Placeholder methods do not introduce risks.  \n- Slightly lower risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard component resolution, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Very high confidence, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are straightforward, standard implementations for HTTP signature component resolution.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly related to untrusted message objects, which is typical for such utilities.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on untrusted input, but standard for such code)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being a standard, safe component for HTTP signature resolution. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified given the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No supply chain or malicious activity concerns are evident from these snippets.",
