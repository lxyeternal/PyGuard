{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for resolving components and keys related to HTTP message signatures, used in message validation and security.",
  "sources": "The code reads message attributes such as 'url', 'headers', 'status_code', and method from message objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method calls that use message attributes, especially in resolve() and resolve_public_key()/resolve_private_key().",
  "flows": "Data flows from message attributes into resolver methods; for example, message.url into URL parsing functions, headers into dictionary lookups, and method/response codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward method calls. The only dynamic aspect involves attribute access and exception raising for unknown components.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation and extraction of HTTP message components based on predefined component names. It uses standard Python libraries for URL parsing and data structures. No external code execution, data leakage, or suspicious network activity occurs within this code snippet. The methods include basic validation and retrieval, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. The exception handling is for invalid component names or missing headers/parameters. The functions are well-structured, and the code appears to be a part of a larger, security-focused framework, not malicious. No suspicious behaviors or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for extracting and validating parts of HTTP messages for signature verification. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility component within a security library.",
