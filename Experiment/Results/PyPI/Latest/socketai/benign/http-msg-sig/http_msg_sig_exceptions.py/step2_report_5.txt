  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code consists solely of two class definitions:\n```python\nclass HTTPMessageSignaturesException(Exception):\n    \"Base class for exceptions raised by http_msg_sig\"\n\nclass InvalidSignature(HTTPMessageSignaturesException):\n    \"Class for exceptions raised in the course of verifying an HTTP message signature\"\n```\nThese are simple, static class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, logic, or external interactions. The code serves as a structured way to handle specific error cases in a larger application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. It is a straightforward exception class definition.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The classes are standard, with proper inheritance and descriptive docstrings.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there is no malicious code, no suspicious imports, or behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports correctly do not assume any vulnerabilities, as the code only defines exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes, all scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Any recommendations for score adjustments?**  \n  No, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes. No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, clear, and serves a structural purpose in exception handling. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
