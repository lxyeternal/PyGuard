  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions related to HTTP message signature validation",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception classes do not read input or data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; just class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of exception class definitions with docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The classes serve as structured exception types for HTTP message signature validation errors. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, nor any indicators of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
