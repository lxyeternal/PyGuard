  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP message signature verification errors",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code declares two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. The classes are straightforward, used for signaling specific errors related to HTTP message signatures. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic or external communications. The code appears to serve a structural role in error handling without any malicious intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It is safe and typical for Python applications.",
