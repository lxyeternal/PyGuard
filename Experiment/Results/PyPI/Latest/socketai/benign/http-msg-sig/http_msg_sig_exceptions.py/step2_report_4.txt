  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two exception classes:\n     ```python\n     class HTTPMessageSignaturesException(Exception):\n         \"Base class for exceptions raised by http_msg_sig\"\n\n     class InvalidSignature(HTTPMessageSignaturesException):\n         \"Class for exceptions raised in the course of verifying an HTTP message signature\"\n     ```\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic.\n   - The classes serve as custom exception types for error handling in a larger application.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are reported or implied.\n   - The consistent conclusion across reports is that the code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Confidence**: All reports have a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware**: 0, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Security Risk**: 0, since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations**:\n   - The reports seem thorough and consistent; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation and Recommendations**:\n   - The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk should remain at 0.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the reports.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the actual code content.",
