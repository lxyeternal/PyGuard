  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code only defines two simple exception classes with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The code is purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code only defines exception classes without any security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely structural with no logic, data handling, or external interactions, there is no justification for increasing the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and only serves as exception definitions.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n### My reasoning:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the assigned scores. The code is a standard, harmless pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and appropriate for its purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Security risk score: **0**",
