  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The original code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, logic, or external interactions.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely structural, serving as exception types for HTTP message signature validation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.5 (if any) are appropriate.\n   - No change needed here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no assumptions about hidden malicious code are made.\n   - The assessments are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is safe, simple, and serves as a structural component for error handling. The reports are thorough and accurate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
