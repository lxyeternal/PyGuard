  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP message signature validation errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input or output; purely static class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class inheritance hierarchy established.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, serving as error indicators for HTTP message signature validation. There are no executable logic, data handling, or external calls. The code is simple, clear, and standard for error handling in Python. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements, nor does it introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
