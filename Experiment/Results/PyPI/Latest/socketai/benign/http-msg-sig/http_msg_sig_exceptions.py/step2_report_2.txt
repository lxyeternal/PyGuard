  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe provided code defines two custom exception classes:\n```python\nclass HTTPMessageSignaturesException(Exception):\n    \"Base class for exceptions raised by http_msg_sig\"\n\nclass InvalidSignature(HTTPMessageSignaturesException):\n    \"Class for exceptions raised in the course of verifying an HTTP message signature\"\n```\nThis is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. There are no data inputs, no data flows, no executable logic, and no external interactions. The classes serve purely as error signaling mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code only contains class definitions with docstrings, no operational or malicious code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code contains only class definitions for exceptions, there's no malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  The code is clear and simple; no obfuscation is present. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  The code doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities. It only defines exception classes, which are safe. The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no input/output, and no suspicious patterns. The assumption that these are benign exception class definitions is valid.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe, and standard implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP message signature validation. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.",
