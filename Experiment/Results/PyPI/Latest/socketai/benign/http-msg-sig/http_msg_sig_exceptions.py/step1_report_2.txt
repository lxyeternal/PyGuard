  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP message signature errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines classes",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external effects present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares classes and docstrings",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code declares a base exception class for HTTP message signature errors and a derived class for invalid signatures. Both classes are straightforward, containing only class docstrings and no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves solely to define exception classes related to HTTP message signature validation. It presents no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
