{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling HTTP message signature errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is solely class definition",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no external inputs, data processing, or security-sensitive operations involved. The structure and content are typical for custom exception classes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for HTTP message signature validation. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
