  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP message signature errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; just class inheritance setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes: HTTPMessageSignaturesException as a base class, and InvalidSignature as a subclass. Both are simple class declarations inheriting from Python's built-in Exception, with only docstrings describing their purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports, or code patterns. The classes are designed for exception handling in a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes for HTTP message signature verification errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be a benign part of a larger security or validation framework.",
