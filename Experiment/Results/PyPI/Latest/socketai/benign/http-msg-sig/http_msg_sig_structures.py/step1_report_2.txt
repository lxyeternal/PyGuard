  "purpose": "Define a case-insensitive dictionary class that mimics request structures.",
  "sources": "Initialization data passed to the constructor (__init__).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is directly used for security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization (__init__) into internal storage, accessed via __getitem__, __setitem__, and comparison methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The copy method incorrectly returns self._store.values() which may not produce a proper copy of the object but is not malicious. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom dictionary class that handles case-insensitive keys by storing original keys alongside their lowercased versions. Standard methods (__setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, __iter__, __len__, __eq__, copy, __repr__) are implemented. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The copy method does not create a deep copy but this does not pose security risk. The class does not execute any untrusted input or interact with external systems. No obfuscated code or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility class for handling dictionaries insensitively to case, similar to a known pattern.",
