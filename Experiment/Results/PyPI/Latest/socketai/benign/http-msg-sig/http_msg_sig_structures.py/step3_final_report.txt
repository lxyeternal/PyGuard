{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary that wraps an OrderedDict, preserving original key casing while allowing case-insensitive access.",
  "sources": "Input data provided during initialization, key-value pairs set via __setitem__ or update methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data flows; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data to internal _store; no external sinks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method returns self._store.values(), which is a view object rather than a true copy, potentially leading to logical issues but not security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a case-insensitive dict, using standard patterns. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor concern is the copy() method's return value, which does not produce a proper copy but is not malicious. The code aligns with standard practices and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor issue with the copy() method does not pose security risks but could be improved for correctness. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
