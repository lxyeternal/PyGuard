{
  "purpose": "This code implements various cryptographic signature algorithms and key loading mechanisms for secure message signing and verification.",
  "sources": "Loads PEM-encoded keys from bytes, receives messages to sign/verify, and optionally accepts passwords for private keys.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions to sign and verify messages; does not contain data leaks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Key loading from PEM bytes → signing/verifying messages using cryptographic primitives",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code performs standard cryptographic operations with proper validation of key types and lengths.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography primitives to implement signing and verification for RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, and Ed25519. It properly loads keys from PEM formats, performs type validation, and uses appropriate padding and hashing schemes. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The design appears to be standard for cryptographic libraries, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cryptographic signature algorithms with proper validation and no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured cryptography module without malicious behavior.",
