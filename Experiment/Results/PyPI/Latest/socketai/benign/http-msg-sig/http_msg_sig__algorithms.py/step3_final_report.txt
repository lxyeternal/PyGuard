  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility module implementing various signing and verification algorithms with key loading and validation.",
  "sources": "PEM key loading functions, key validation checks, cryptographic signing/verifying methods",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; cryptographic operations are standard and internal",
  "flows": "Loading PEM keys -> Validating key types -> Signing/verifying messages",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard cryptography libraries to load, validate, and perform cryptographic operations with RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, and Ed25519 keys. Key validation checks ensure correct key types, and signing/verifying methods follow best practices. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and standard cryptographic nature. The overall security posture is high, with minimal inherent risk and no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented cryptography utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
