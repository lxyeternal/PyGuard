  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states no anomalies or malicious behavior. The code appears standard cryptography implementation, with proper key loading, validation, and signing/verifying functions.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or logical flaws are evident. The reasoning aligns with the code structure.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Justification of risk score:** The low risk score is justified; the code is a straightforward cryptography utility.\n\n- **Overall:** No issues detected. The report's assessment seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard cryptography code with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious patterns observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Justification:** The code handles key material securely, with proper validation.\n\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment, no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — consistent.\n\n- **Overall:** The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No anomalies or malicious behavior; standard cryptographic functions.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is standard cryptography with proper key handling.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns or errors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n\n- **Overall:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity—no network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable given the code's nature; no major security flaws or dangerous practices are evident.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, standard cryptography code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-implemented cryptography utility module with no malicious intent or security flaws.",
