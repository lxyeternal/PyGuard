  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Claims & Observations:**  \n  - The code implements standard cryptographic algorithms with proper key loading, validation, and no malicious behavior.  \n  - No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.  \n  - The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1).\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  - The code matches the description; it loads PEM keys, performs signing/verifying with standard cryptography primitives, and validates key types.\n\n- **Potential issues:**  \n  - No issues found.  \n  - The code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 is appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Claims & Observations:**  \n  - Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard cryptography and proper key handling.  \n  - No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.  \n  - Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  - The code aligns with the description; key loading, signing, verification, and validation are correct.\n\n- **Potential issues:**  \n  - No issues detected.  \n  - Minor concern about exception handling, but this is typical.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 is appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 is acceptable; the code is standard cryptography.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Claims & Observations:**  \n  - Similar to previous reports; standard cryptography with proper key validation.  \n  - No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  - The code matches the description; key loading, signing, verifying, and validation are consistent.\n\n- **Potential issues:**  \n  - No issues.  \n  - The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Claims & Observations:**  \n  - Again, similar cryptographic implementation with proper key handling and no signs of malicious activity.  \n  - Standard cryptography library usage.\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  - The code aligns with the description; key loading, signing, verification, and validation are correct.\n\n- **Potential issues:**  \n  - No issues.  \n  - No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Claims & Observations:**  \n  - Same pattern: standard cryptographic implementations, proper key validation, no malicious activity.  \n  - No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  - The code matches the description; key loading, signing, verifying, validation are consistent.\n\n- **Potential issues:**  \n  - No issues.  \n  - No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity and straightforward cryptography usage.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the inherent risks in cryptography but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — typical cryptography implementation risk, no evident security flaws.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- No changes needed in scores.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is high, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant risks identified.",
