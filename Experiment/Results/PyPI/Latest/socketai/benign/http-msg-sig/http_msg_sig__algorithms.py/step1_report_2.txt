{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations of various cryptographic signature algorithms for signing and verifying messages, including RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, and Ed25519, primarily for message authentication and integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Key data is loaded from PEM-formatted bytes or raw byte sequences via load_pem_keys, load_keys, or directly passed as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic operations such as sign() and verify() methods act as sinks, processing key material and input messages. No direct data leaks or external communication functions are present.",
  "flows": "Public/private key data flows into load methods, which initialize key objects. These keys are used in sign() and verify() functions to produce or check signatures on messages. The shared secret in HMAC is also used directly in signing and verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration routines. The code uses standard cryptography libraries with proper key handling. The only minor concern is that exceptions are thrown on key type mismatches, but this is typical in cryptographic code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes implementing cryptographic signatures using standard libraries from 'cryptography'. It correctly loads keys from PEM bytes and raw bytes, performs signature operations, and checks key types. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are detected. The key handling appears standard, and there are no external communications, network operations, or hidden routines. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured cryptography utility module, without malicious intent or security flaws evident in this review.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard cryptographic signature functionalities with proper key handling and verification processes. No malicious behaviors, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies are observed. The implementation appears safe and appropriate for cryptographic operations, with no evidence of malware or security risks within the analyzed scope.",
