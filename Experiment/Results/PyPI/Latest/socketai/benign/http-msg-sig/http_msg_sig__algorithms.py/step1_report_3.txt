  "purpose": "Implementation of various cryptographic signature algorithms for secure message signing and verification.",
  "sources": "PEM key data inputs, bytes inputs for keys, message bytes for signing/verifying, optional password inputs for encrypted keys.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent over the network, no external connections or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Keys are loaded from PEM or raw bytes, then used directly in cryptographic operations for signing or verification. No external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation observed. The code relies on standard cryptography library functions and standard data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple cryptographic signature classes for RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, and Ed25519 algorithms, loading keys from PEM or byte data, and performing signing/verifying operations. There are appropriate key type checks, padding schemes, and use of secure cryptography practices. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility library with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of cryptographic signature algorithms, focusing on correct key handling and signing/verifying processes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling identified. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate security use.",
