  "purpose": "Define various cryptographic signature algorithms and key loaders for secure message signing and verification.",
  "sources": "Loads PEM-encoded public and private keys, bytes inputs for keys, and cryptographic function calls for signing and verification.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic libraries to perform signing and verification operations, which are standard for secure cryptography; no data leakage or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Keys are loaded from bytes input, then used in sign and verify functions. Data flows from input to cryptographic operations, with no unusual data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code adheres to standard cryptographic library usage. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cryptographic signing and verification using well-known algorithms and libraries, with proper key type checks and no suspicious code flows. The key loading mechanisms use standard functions to load PEM or byte-encoded keys. The signing and verification processes follow cryptographic best practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The dynamic creation of the signature algorithms list is benign and based on class inheritance. Overall, the code is a typical cryptography utility module, with secure and proper use of cryptographic primitives.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a set of cryptographic signing and verification classes, correctly implemented with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard cryptography libraries and techniques without suspicious patterns. No malware or security risks are evident.",
