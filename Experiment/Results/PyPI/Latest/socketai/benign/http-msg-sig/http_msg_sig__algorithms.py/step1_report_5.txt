{
  "purpose": "The code implements various cryptographic signature algorithms for signing and verifying messages, including RSA, ECDSA, HMAC, and Ed25519, typically used for secure message authentication.",
  "sources": "Key loading methods (`load_pem_keys`, `load_keys`) that read PEM-encoded key data, and key parameters passed during class instantiation (public_key, private_key, shared_secret).",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic sign and verify methods (`sign()`, `verify()`) that process message data with provided keys or secrets.",
  "flows": "Source: PEM key data or key bytes -> Key loading functions -> Cryptographic signing or verification functions (`sign()`, `verify()`).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling found. The key handling follows standard cryptographic practices without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No network activity or external data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several cryptographic classes implementing standard algorithms with proper key loading from PEM or byte data. It validates key types and curves appropriately, and uses well-established cryptography libraries. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions perform expected cryptographic operations securely. The only potential concern is if key data is externally provided and not properly validated elsewhere, but within this code, key validation appears correct. Overall, it appears to be standard cryptographic implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements cryptographic signature schemes securely with proper key validation and usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears legitimate and safe for cryptographic purposes.",
