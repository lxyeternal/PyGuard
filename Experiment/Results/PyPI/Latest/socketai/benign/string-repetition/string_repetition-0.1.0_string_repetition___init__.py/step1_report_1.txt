  "purpose": "This code exports classes related to string repetition detection, likely for use as a utility module in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only module-level imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares the package version, and exports two classes imported from a local module. It contains no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no external network activity, and no embedded secrets or obfuscated code. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages imports and exports for a package component.",
