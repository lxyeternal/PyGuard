{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes related to string repetition detection and defines package metadata, serving as an initialization or interface module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local core module, and package metadata assignments (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and typical for Python package init files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module, indicating modular design. It defines version info and exports symbols via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, external network calls, or obfuscation. The content is straightforward and standard for package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
