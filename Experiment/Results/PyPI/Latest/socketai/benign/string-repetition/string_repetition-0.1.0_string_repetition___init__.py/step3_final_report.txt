  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization file that imports specific classes from a local module and defines versioning and export symbols for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local '.core' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and assigns version and export variables without any data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py setup for a Python package, importing classes and defining metadata. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. There are no external data flows, secrets, or dynamic behaviors that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary.",
