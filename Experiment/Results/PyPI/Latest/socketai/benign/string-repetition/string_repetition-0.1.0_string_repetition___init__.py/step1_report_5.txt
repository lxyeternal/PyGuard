  "purpose": "This module imports specific classes from a local core module and defines version and export information, likely for a package related to string repetition detection.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core), setting of __version__, and __all__ variables",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources or outputs; simple import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard relative import, followed by straightforward assignments of version and exported symbols. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a typical module setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import and export declarations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
