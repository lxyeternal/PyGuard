  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a straightforward module initialization file, importing classes from a local module and exporting them, with no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, standard import/export with no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a typical __init__.py pattern with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: import, define __version__, __all__ — standard practice.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Identical pattern, standard module setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code is nonexistent.** All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores are consistent** with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n- **Malware score remains at 0** as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score remains at 0**; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score remains at 0**; no security risks identified.\n\n### Final thoughts:\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code, the risk is minimal. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is required.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
