  "purpose": "Detects repeated substrings within a string using Rabin-Karp hashing and parallel processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input string(s), computes prefix hashes and substring hashes internally.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; processes data internally without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Hashes substrings (sources) and compares hashes to identify repetitions (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard hashing and multiprocessing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Rabin-Karp based pattern detection with multiprocessing for batch processing. It reads input strings, computes prefix hashes, and searches for repeated substrings via binary search on substring length, verifying repetitions through hash comparisons and direct string comparison. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs common techniques for pattern detection. No external system interactions or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate string pattern detection utility employing standard hashing and multiprocessing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the use of multiprocessing which could be misused in other contexts but is benign here.",
