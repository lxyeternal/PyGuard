  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on available code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic imports, eval/exec calls, obfuscated variable names, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code, potential data exfiltration via network, use of obfuscated code hiding malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input data or code sources potentially flow into eval/exec or dynamic import statements, leading to execution or obfuscation concealment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, exec, dynamic import, obfuscated variable names, and dynamic features without concrete code confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code is largely absent or described only in high-level terms. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 correctly identify the lack of code and assign low risk and malware scores. Report 3 notes suspicious features like eval, dynamic import, and obfuscation, which are valid concerns. However, without actual code, these are assumptions. The initial malware score of 0.2 and obfuscated score of 0.4 in Report 3 underestimate the potential risk posed by such features. Given the potential for malicious exploitation, these should be increased to better reflect the suspicion. Adjustments: malware score from 0.2 to 0.4, obfuscated from 0.4 to 0.4 (unchanged), risk from 0.3 to 0.4. Other reports remain appropriate with zero scores due to lack of code.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the assessments are cautious and mostly appropriate. The primary concern is Report 3, where dynamic features could be exploited maliciously. Increasing malware and risk scores for this report improves the accuracy of the security evaluation.",
