  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata and reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data transmission; static metadata used in setup()",
  "flows": "File reading from local filesystem to long_description variable, then static setup() call",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a local README.md file for long_description, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. No user input, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The placeholder author info is typical in template scripts. The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. The code poses no security threat and is appropriate for package configuration.",
