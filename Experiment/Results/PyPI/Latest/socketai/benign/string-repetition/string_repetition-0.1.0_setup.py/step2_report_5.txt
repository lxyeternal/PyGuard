  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- Placeholder author information is typical in template code and not suspicious.\n- The package metadata and file reading are static and safe.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the analysis. The code is benign and standard.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present, the overall risk scores should remain at zero.\n- The malware score of 0 accurately reflects no malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The securityRisk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n- All reports seem to be based on the assumption that the code is a simple setup script, which is accurate.\n- No claims are made about hidden malicious code or obfuscation, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be adjusted.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
