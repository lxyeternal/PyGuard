  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, network activity, environment variables, user inputs, file operations, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks via data processing, dynamic execution, or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated variable names, unnecessary complexity, network activity, lack of code or suspicious patterns in most reports.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates dynamic code execution, network activity, and obfuscation, justifying high suspicion with scores: malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.75. Other reports lack code or evidence, with scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2-0.3, which are appropriate given their limited information. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with Report 1 justifying higher concern. No adjustments needed; the overall assessment aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Only Report 1 demonstrates suspicious behavior with justifiable high scores; the remaining reports are benign or inconclusive. The current scoring accurately reflects the evidence, with a moderate overall threat level primarily driven by Report 1.",
