{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the solanautil Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, finding packages in 'src' directory",
  "fires": "No untrusted data inputs, no user input handling, no dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, no malicious payloads observed",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. All operations involve static file reading and package metadata assignment. No code injection, no external input processing, no network connections, and no malicious or suspicious behavior are present. The package data includes only shared object and Python dynamic library files, which is typical for extension modules. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
