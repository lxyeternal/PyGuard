  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'solanautil', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package configuration using setuptools, including reading a README file and defining dependencies. It does not include dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling that could be exploited maliciously. The package data and classifiers are standard. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
