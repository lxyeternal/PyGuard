  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'solanautil' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and defines package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file during setup; dependencies are specified explicitly and securely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README.md file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No input/output handling that could be exploited is found. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The dependencies are common and explicitly declared, with no indication of malicious behavior. The package data includes compiled files (.so, .pyd) which are typical for Python extensions. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
