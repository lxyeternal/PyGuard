{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package called 'solanautil', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not process user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading the README file to include as long description during package setup; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The package data references native shared object files but this is typical for binary extensions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies, and includes package data such as shared objects. There are no dynamic executions, code injections, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The dependencies listed are common for cryptographic and network operations, consistent with a Solana utility package. The code structure and content do not indicate malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a legitimate and typical configuration file for packaging a Python project. It contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
