  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, primarily involving reading a README.md file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling are identified.\n- The package data includes native shared object files (*.so, *.pyd), which is typical for extension modules.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any signs of malicious activity.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and uses standard packaging practices.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The dependencies are common cryptographic and network libraries, consistent with a Solana utility package.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The scoring is appropriate given the analysis—malware and security risk scores are 0, and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- The confidence level is 1.0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n### Score justification:\n- The malware score of 0 is correct, as no malicious activity is observed.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as there's no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate, given the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- No changes needed; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Given the code and the reports, I agree with the assigned scores.** The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect this. No further action or concern is necessary.",
