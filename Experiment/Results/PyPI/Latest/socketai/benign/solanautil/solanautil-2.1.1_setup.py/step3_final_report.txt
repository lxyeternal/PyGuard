{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script using setuptools, reading README.md for long description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static code defining setup() parameters, no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file read to setup() parameters; no runtime or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data, and calls setup() from setuptools. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The package data includes native shared object files, which is common for extension modules. All dependencies are standard libraries or well-known packages. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The static analysis indicates a benign, standard configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
