  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No executable flow; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'run_experiments' from a module within 'slurm_emission'. There is no execution, data handling, or dynamic code evaluation present. The module name suggests it is related to SLURM job submission, but the snippet itself does not perform any action. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks evident in this snippet. It does not include executable or data flow that could be exploited or malicious.",
