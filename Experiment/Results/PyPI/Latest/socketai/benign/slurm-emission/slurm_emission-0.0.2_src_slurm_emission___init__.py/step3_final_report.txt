  "purpose": "This code imports the function 'run_experiments' from the 'slurm_emission.submit_jobs' module, likely for executing batch or HPC jobs related to SLURM workload management.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'slurm_emission.submit_jobs' module to access 'run_experiments'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution flows within this snippet; it only imports a function without invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no execution, data handling, or suspicious activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Since no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident, the malware score should be 0. The security risk score should also be 0, as the code does not perform any operations that could pose a threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement alone does not indicate any threat. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of this code snippet.",
