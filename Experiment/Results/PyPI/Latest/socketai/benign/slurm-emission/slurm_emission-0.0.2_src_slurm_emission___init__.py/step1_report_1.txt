  "purpose": "Import the 'run_experiments' function from the 'slurm_emission.submit_jobs' module, likely to execute or schedule experiments or jobs via SLURM workload manager.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'slurm_emission.submit_jobs'. No other data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is established within this snippet; the imported function is not invoked.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a specific function from an external module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The import may be part of a larger script that executes jobs, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard operation to include a function from a module, likely for scheduling or running experiments.",
