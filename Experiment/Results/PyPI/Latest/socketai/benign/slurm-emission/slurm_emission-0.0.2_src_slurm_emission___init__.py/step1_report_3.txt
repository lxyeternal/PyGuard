  "purpose": "The code imports a function named run_experiments from the slurm_emission.submit_jobs module, likely intended to execute or submit experimental jobs via SLURM workload manager.",
  "sources": "Import statement from slurm_emission.submit_jobs",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted output observed",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or data transfer paths identified within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "This snippet only imports a function without executing or passing data. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. Since no function invocation or data manipulation is shown, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. The import suggests reliance on an external module, which should be reviewed separately for security concerns, but this snippet alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, the code appears benign and does not show signs of malicious intent. It is a simple import with no evident security risks or suspicious behavior.",
