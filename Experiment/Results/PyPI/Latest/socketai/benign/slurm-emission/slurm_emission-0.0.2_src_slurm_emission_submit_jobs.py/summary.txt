  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate experiment management utility with no malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from the use of os.system() with concatenated commands, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Input validation and safer command execution methods are recommended to mitigate this risk. Overall, the code is benign but warrants cautious handling of inputs to prevent command injection."
