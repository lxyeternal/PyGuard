  "purpose": "The code provides a function to anonymize data values based on specified facets and optional transforms, using registered anonymizer functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'facet', 'original_value', and optionally 'transform'.",
  "sinks": "Returns anonymized values; no direct data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'facet' and 'original_value' are validated and processed through registered functions; optional 'transform' influences data flow but no external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The loop that repeatedly generates anonymized values until a non-duplicate is found is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports registry and transform modules, then defines an anonymize function. It checks for the presence of a facet in the registry, retrieves the associated generator, and applies optional transformation logic. If no transform is provided, it directly applies the generator. If a transform exists, it checks whether the original value is already contained; if not, it generates a new anonymized value repeatedly until it differs from existing anonymized values, then records the mapping. The process is straightforward, with no network calls, file operations, or suspicious logic. The loop could be inefficient but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard anonymization operations with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet. The only unusual aspect is the potential inefficiency of the repeat loop, which does not indicate malicious intent.",
