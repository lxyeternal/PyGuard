{
  "purpose": "Defines a registry system for dynamically registering anonymizer functions for different data facets.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only uses function parameters and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the registered anonymizer functions could process untrusted data, but they are not invoked within this code.",
  "flows": "The code stores user-defined functions in a global registry; no direct flow from untrusted input to sensitive sinks occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The registry mechanism is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a global dictionary for registering anonymizer functions keyed by data facet names. The register_anonymizer function adds entries to this registry, raising an error if a duplicate registration is attempted. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not execute or invoke the registered functions, nor does it handle any external input directly, reducing risk. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple, safe registry for anonymizer functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose security risks by itself, though its safety depends on the trustworthiness of the functions registered.",
