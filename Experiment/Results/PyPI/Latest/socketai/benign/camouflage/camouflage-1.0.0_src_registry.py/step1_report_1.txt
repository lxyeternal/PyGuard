{
  "purpose": "The code manages a registry of anonymizer functions for different data facets, allowing dynamic registration of functions to anonymize specific data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the function arguments and the global registry _ANONYMIZER_REGISTRY.",
  "targets": "The functions stored in the registry can be invoked to process data, but this code does not include such invocation; it only registers functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (function arguments) into the registry through register_anonymizer, but there are no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code performs straightforward registration with duplicate check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global registry for anonymizer functions, providing a registration function with duplicate prevention. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The functions are stored and can be called later, but this snippet itself does not perform any unsafe operations or malicious actions. The structure and purpose align with standard registry management, with no hidden or obfuscated code, nor any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a safe, standard implementation of a registry for anonymization functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
