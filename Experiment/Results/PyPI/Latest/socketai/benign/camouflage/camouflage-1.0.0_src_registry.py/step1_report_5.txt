{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a registry of anonymizer functions for different data facets.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; functions are registered within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output operations; the code stores functions in a registry.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from external sources to sinks in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for registry management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a global dictionary to hold anonymizer functions keyed by data facet names. It provides a registration function that adds new anonymizers, raising an error if one already exists for the facet. The code contains no external data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It performs standard operations for function registration with proper error handling, and uses type hints and docstrings appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign registry management module for anonymizer functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks in this implementation.",
