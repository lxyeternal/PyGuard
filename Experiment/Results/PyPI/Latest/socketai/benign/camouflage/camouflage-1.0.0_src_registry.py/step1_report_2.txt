{
  "purpose": "This code provides a registry mechanism for dynamically registering anonymizer functions associated with specific data facets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters ('facet' and 'generator_fn') during registration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present; the code solely updates an internal registry.",
  "flows": "The flow involves storing provided generator functions into a global dictionary keyed by facet names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code implements standard registration logic without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global registry for anonymizer functions, allowing dynamic addition via the 'register_anonymizer' function. It includes a check to prevent duplicate registrations for the same facet, raising a ValueError if such an attempt occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns. Usage appears straightforward and intended solely for managing anonymization functions. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. It is a typical pattern for plugin-like extensibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe registry for anonymizer functions with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears secure and designed solely for managing anonymization callbacks.",
