  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a function registry for data anonymization. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious activity, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
