{
  "purpose": "A registry to hold anonymizer functions for different data facets, allowing dynamic registration of anonymization functions.",
  "sources": "Function arguments providing facet name and generator function; internal dictionary _ANONYMIZER_REGISTRY storing mappings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data flows are present; functions are registered but not invoked within this code.",
  "flows": "Registration flow: input parameters (facet, generator_fn) stored into the registry; no external data flow or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global registry for anonymizer functions, with a registration function that prevents duplicate entries. It does not process external data, execute functions, or perform network operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, primarily depending on external trust in registered functions, which is outside this snippet. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a function registry for data anonymization. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious activity, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
