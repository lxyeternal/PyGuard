{
  "purpose": "Module initialization and importing core components and functions related to data anonymization, transformation, and plugin management.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules within the same package and specific classes/functions like PandasAdapter, anonymize, deanonymize, register_anonymizer, and Transform.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed; code is standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are used to include internal modules and functions. There is no executable code, data processing, or network communication. Since no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present, there are no apparent security concerns or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be part of a modular package structure for data anonymization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of import statements for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It functions as a setup for further functionality elsewhere in the package.",
