  "purpose": "Module imports for data anonymization, transformation, and plugin management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and packages: plugins, adapters, anonymizer, deanonymizer, registry, transform.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and functions without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The imports are standard and indicate typical functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules within a package. No executable logic, input handling, or external communications are present. The modules imported relate to data anonymization and transformation, which are typical in privacy-focused packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure and format are straightforward, with no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for a data anonymization and transformation library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
