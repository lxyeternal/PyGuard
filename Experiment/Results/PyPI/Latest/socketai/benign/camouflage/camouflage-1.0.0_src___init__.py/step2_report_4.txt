  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only import statements from local modules, with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication.\n- The code snippets are straightforward and typical for a modular Python package focused on data anonymization and transformation.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal concern based on just import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The original code snippet is just import statements, matching the reports' descriptions.\n- No code execution, data flow, or external communication is present.\n- The reports correctly state that these are standard import statements for a data privacy library.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical flaws or suspicious behavior.\n- The reasoning that these snippets are safe and typical is accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1), justified by the fact that these are just import statements; if these modules are safe, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- Since only import statements are involved, the risk is minimal unless the imported modules themselves are malicious—nothing in the reports suggests that.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities solely based on imports.\n- No claims of malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, just standard import statements)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the minimal inherent risk in package structure, but no active threats)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final note:** If in the future, the imported modules are examined and found to contain malicious code, then the malware score should be updated accordingly. But based solely on these import statements, the current scores are justified.",
