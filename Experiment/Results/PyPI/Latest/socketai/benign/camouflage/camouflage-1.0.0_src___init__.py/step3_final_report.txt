{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to data anonymization, transformation, and plugin management, serving as part of a larger package setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: plugins, adapters, anonymizer, deanonymizer, registry, transform",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A — only static import statements, no data flow or execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a modular package structure. There is no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The absence of anomalies or obfuscation suggests benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of these import statements. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the safe, structural nature of the code.",
