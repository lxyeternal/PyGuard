  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data anonymization utility that applies a random scale to input amounts. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessment scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
