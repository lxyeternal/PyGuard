{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing bi-directional data transformations, specifically for anonymizing data by mapping original values to anonymized values and vice versa.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code; all data inputs are via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; the code only manipulates internal dictionaries and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows through method calls that add mappings and retrieve values; there are no external or network data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual logic. The code strictly manages internal data structures without external effects.",
  "analysis": "The classes facilitate the storage and retrieval of anonymization mappings for different data facets. The add methods insert mappings into dictionaries, and the get methods retrieve mapped values, raising exceptions if not found. There are no external data sources, no network or system calls, no file operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve a data transformation purpose, typical for data anonymization or pseudonymization tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data transformation utility for managing reversible mappings, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard dictionary operations for bi-directional value mapping, with exception handling for missing data. Overall, it appears safe and consistent with data anonymization functions.",
