{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and methods for managing bi-directional transformations between original and anonymized values for different data facets.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only manipulates in-memory dictionaries and UUIDs.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows between methods managing internal dictionaries; no external data or system interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code's logic is straightforward and mainly manages mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to mapping original to anonymized data and vice versa. It uses in-memory dictionaries for storage, with no external input/output operations or network activity. There are no suspicious code patterns, hidden code, or obfuscated constructs. The usage of UUIDs for transform identifiers is standard. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for data anonymization workflows. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of data transformation management with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a data mapping utility for anonymization purposes, with proper structure and no suspicious elements.",
