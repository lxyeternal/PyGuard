  "purpose": "Manage bidirectional mappings between original and anonymized data values across multiple facets for data anonymization.",
  "sources": "In-memory dictionaries within the FacetTransform and Transform classes.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval methods (get_forward, get_backward) that expose mappings, potentially revealing sensitive data if accessed maliciously.",
  "flows": "add() methods populate forward and backward dictionaries; get_forward() and get_backward() retrieve data; contains_original() and contains_anonymized() check existence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data sources; straightforward dictionary manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for reversible data mappings, using in-memory dictionaries with standard exception handling. No external I/O, network activity, or system modifications are present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only potential security concern is that retrieval methods could expose sensitive mappings if accessed improperly, but this is inherent to the utility's purpose and not a flaw. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score (~0.1) reflects the potential data exposure if mappings are accessed maliciously, but does not indicate active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for managing reversible data transformations, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security risk score is appropriate, considering potential data exposure if access is uncontrolled. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data anonymization workflows.",
