  "purpose": "Dynamically import all modules in the current package",
  "sources": "pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__) which reads module information from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module() which loads modules into memory",
  "flows": "Iterates over module info to import each module dynamically",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; code relies on standard library functions for dynamic importing",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to list and import modules dynamically from the current package. It does not include any suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. No data is leaked, and no external communication occurs. The pattern is common in plugin or modular systems, with no evident security risks. Since it only imports modules based on filesystem data and uses safe library functions, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard dynamic import operation within a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
