{
  "purpose": "Dynamically imports all modules within the current package, likely for plugin or extension loading.",
  "sources": "Uses pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__) to list modules and importlib.import_module() to import each module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential risk if imported modules execute malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "Sources (module listing) lead directly to module importation, which executes any code at import time.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard pattern for plugin systems. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard library functions for dynamic module discovery and import, common in plugin architectures. While safe in trusted environments, it can pose security risks if malicious modules are present, as they will be imported and executed without validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or code injection is evident. The main concern is environment trustworthiness rather than code maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for plugin systems. The primary security consideration is the lack of validation before importing modules, which could lead to executing malicious code if untrusted modules are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate at 0.3 due to potential risks in untrusted environments.",
