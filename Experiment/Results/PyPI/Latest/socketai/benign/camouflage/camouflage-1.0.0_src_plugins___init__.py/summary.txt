  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for plugin systems. The primary security consideration is the lack of validation before importing modules, which could lead to executing malicious code if untrusted modules are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate at 0.3 due to potential risks in untrusted environments."
