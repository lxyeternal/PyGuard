  "purpose": "Dynamically imports all modules within the current package.",
  "sources": "Uses 'pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__)' to list modules; uses 'importlib.import_module' to import each module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially importing all modules without explicit control, which could lead to execution of malicious or unintended code if malicious modules are present in the package.",
  "flows": "Iterates over modules discovered in '__path__' and imports them dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs a standard dynamic import pattern, which is common in plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library modules 'importlib' and 'pkgutil' to dynamically import all modules in the current package directory. It relies on '__path__' to locate modules, which is typical for package modules. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. However, importing all modules dynamically can be risky if malicious modules are present, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. It is a common pattern in plugin architectures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard dynamic module import within a package. There is no direct malicious intent or malicious code within this snippet. However, the approach assumes that the package contents are safe, and if malicious modules are present, they could be executed upon import. Overall, this is a typical plugin loading pattern with minimal security concerns.",
