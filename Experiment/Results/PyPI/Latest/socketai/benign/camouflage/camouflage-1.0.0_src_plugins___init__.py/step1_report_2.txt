  "flows": "pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__) -> importlib.import_module for each module in __name__",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of all modules in the package, which can be exploited if malicious modules are present; no validation or filtering of modules before import",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports all modules within the current package using pkgutil.iter_modules and importlib.import_module. While this is a common pattern for plugin systems, it can be risky if untrusted or malicious modules are present in the package directory, as they will be imported and executed automatically. No explicit validation, filtering, or security checks are performed before importing modules, increasing the risk if the package directory is compromised or contains malicious modules. The code does not contain any obfuscation or hidden logic, but the behavior of importing all modules dynamically can lead to execution of malicious code if such modules exist.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic import pattern for plugin-like architectures, but it poses security risks if the package directory contains malicious modules. It does not contain malicious behavior by itself, but the lack of validation makes it potentially dangerous in untrusted environments.",
