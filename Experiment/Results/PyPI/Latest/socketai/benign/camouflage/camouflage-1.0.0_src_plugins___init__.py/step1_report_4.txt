  "purpose": "Dynamically imports all modules within the current package to ensure they are loaded into the namespace.",
  "sources": "Uses pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__) to list modules and importlib.import_module to load them.",
  "sinks": "Potentially loading all modules dynamically could lead to execution of unintended or malicious modules if present in the package.",
  "flows": "iter_modules(__path__) provides module names, which are then imported via importlib.import_module, executing their code.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically imports all modules in the package without filtering or validation, which can be risky if malicious modules are present.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a list of all modules in the current package directory and imports each one dynamically. While this is a common pattern for plugin systems, it poses a security risk if the package contents are untrusted or if malicious modules are included. The code does not perform validation, filtering, or sandboxing of modules before import. It could execute malicious code if such modules are present, especially in environments where package integrity is not verified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs dynamic module loading, which is common but can be risky if package contents are not trusted. Without validation, it could potentially execute malicious modules. The overall risk depends on the trustworthiness of the package contents.",
