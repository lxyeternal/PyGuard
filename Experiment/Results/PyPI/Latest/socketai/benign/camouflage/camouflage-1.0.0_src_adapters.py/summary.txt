  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured DataFrame adapter for anonymization tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External functions' safety is assumed but should be verified in broader context. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score could be marginally increased if external functions are untrusted."
