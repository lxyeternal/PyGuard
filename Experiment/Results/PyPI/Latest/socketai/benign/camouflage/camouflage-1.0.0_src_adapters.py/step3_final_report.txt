  "purpose": "A pandas DataFrame adapter for anonymizing and deanonymizing specified columns using external functions, validated against a registry.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns specified in the mapper; external functions anonymize() and deanonymize()",
  "sinks": "External functions called within apply() on DataFrame columns; no direct data leaks or system modifications",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame columns into external functions via apply() within anonymize() and deanonymize() methods",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code validates the mapper against a registry, then applies external anonymize/deanonymize functions to DataFrame columns. It copies DataFrames to avoid in-place modifications. No network, file I/O, or malicious code is present. External functions are assumed legitimate; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are found. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured DataFrame adapter for anonymization tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External functions' safety is assumed but should be verified in broader context. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score could be marginally increased if external functions are untrusted.",
