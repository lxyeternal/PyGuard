  "purpose": "This code provides an adapter class for anonymizing and deanonymizing data within pandas DataFrames using registered anonymization facets.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame columns for anonymization/deanonymization, registry lookups for facets.",
  "sinks": "Applying functions to DataFrame columns, potentially untrusted data flows into anonymize/deanonymize functions.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> apply anonymize/deanonymize functions -> output DataFrame with transformed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Use of registry for facet validation appears standard. Lambda functions are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and internal modules, and defines a class for data anonymization tasks. It validates that provided facets are registered, preventing untrusted or malicious facet usage. The anonymize and deanonymize methods apply registered functions to DataFrame columns, copying data to prevent in-place modifications. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity, file access, or other malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data anonymization adapter for pandas DataFrames, with no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs legitimate data processing tasks using registered functions, with proper validation.",
