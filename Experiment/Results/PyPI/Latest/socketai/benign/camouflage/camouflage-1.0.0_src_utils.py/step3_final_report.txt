  "purpose": "Extracts the module name from a file path and validates it as a Python identifier.",
  "sources": "os.path.basename(filepath), string replacement and isidentifier() check",
  "sinks": "Raises ValueError if filename is invalid; no other sinks present",
  "flows": "Filename extracted -> removed extension -> validated as identifier -> exception raised if invalid",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward filename validation logic",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to extract and validate a filename. It raises an exception if the filename (minus extension) is not a valid Python identifier. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The validation is strict and appropriate for module naming. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is simple, clear, and performs a common validation task without obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filename validation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
