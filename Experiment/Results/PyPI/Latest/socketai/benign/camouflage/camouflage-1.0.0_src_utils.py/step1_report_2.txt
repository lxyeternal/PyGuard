  "purpose": "The code extracts a module name from a file path and validates that it is a valid Python identifier.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the parameter 'filepath', which is a string representing a file path.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner. The code raises an exception if the filename is invalid.",
  "flows": "Input 'filepath' flows into os.path.basename(), then into string replacement, then into isidentifier() check, and potentially into a ValueError exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward filename processing and validation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the filename from a given path, strips the '.py' extension, and ensures it is a valid Python identifier. It raises an error if the filename is invalid. This process is standard and does not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no external data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated parts. The code does not interact with external resources or execute any code dynamically. It appears to be a utility function for validating module names.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple and safe operation for extracting and validating module names from file paths. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The function is straightforward and secure.",
