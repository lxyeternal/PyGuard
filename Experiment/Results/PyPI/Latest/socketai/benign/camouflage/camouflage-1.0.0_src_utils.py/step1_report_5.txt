  "purpose": "Extracts a module name from a file path, validating that the name is a valid Python identifier.",
  "sources": "os.path.basename(filepath) reads the file path input.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or dangerous operations occur from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input from the function argument 'filepath' flows through basename, then string replace, and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward string manipulation and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines a function to extract the filename without extension, and checks if it is a valid Python identifier. It raises an error if invalid. The logic is simple and standard, with no external network or system calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The code performs basic validation of filename-based input, typical for plugin or module handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, safe, and does not contain malicious behavior. It simply extracts and validates a filename as a Python identifier, with no suspicious or malicious activities.",
