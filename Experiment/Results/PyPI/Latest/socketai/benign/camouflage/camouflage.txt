External functions' safety is assumed but should be verified in broader context. The current low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the security risk score could be marginally increased if external functions are untrusted."

The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of 'Transform.get_backward'. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns."

The primary security consideration is the lack of validation before importing modules, which could lead to executing malicious code if untrusted modules are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is moderate at 0.3 due to potential risks in untrusted environments."
