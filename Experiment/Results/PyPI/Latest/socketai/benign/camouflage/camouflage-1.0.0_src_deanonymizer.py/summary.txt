  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility that delegates deanonymization to an external method. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of 'Transform.get_backward'. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns."
