{
  "purpose": "The function 'deanonymize' retrieves a backward transformation of a given anonymized value based on a specified facet, likely for restoring or reversing anonymization.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'facet' string, 'anonymized_value', and the 'transform' object. It uses 'transform.get_backward' as the primary source of data processing.",
  "sinks": "The function calls 'transform.get_backward', which may process or return data, but there are no direct sinks that involve data output to untrusted sources, network, or filesystem within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data ('facet' and 'anonymized_value') flow into 'transform.get_backward' method, which presumably processes the data and returns a result. No further data flow is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are apparent. The code is straightforward, calling a method on a 'Transform' object without any suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and a local module, defines a function that acts as a wrapper around 'transform.get_backward'. The function documentation suggests it reverses anonymization for a given facet and value. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. The usage of the 'Transform' class depends on its implementation, but within this snippet, no malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for deanonymizing data using a provided transformation object. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this isolated snippet.",
