  "purpose": "Delegates deanonymization to the Transform class via get_backward method.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'facet' and 'anonymized_value' passed to transform.get_backward.",
  "sinks": "The call to transform.get_backward; potential data processing within that method.",
  "flows": "Input 'facet' and 'anonymized_value' flow into transform.get_backward, which returns the deanonymized value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper function that calls an external method 'get_backward' of the Transform class. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'Transform.get_backward'. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present within this snippet. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting reliance on an external method that could be malicious if compromised, but no direct evidence here. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility that delegates deanonymization to an external method. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of 'Transform.get_backward'. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
