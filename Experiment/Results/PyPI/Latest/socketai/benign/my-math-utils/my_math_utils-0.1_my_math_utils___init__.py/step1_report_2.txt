  "purpose": "Import mathematical utility functions 'add' and 'subtract' from a local module 'math_utils'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'math_utils'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; just a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard import syntax; no anomalies or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a relative module, which is typical for modular Python programs. No external data is read, no user input processed, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The import appears straightforward and does not exhibit signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
