  "purpose": "Importing specific functions 'add' and 'subtract' from a local module 'math_utils'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module file 'math_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions; no data flow, input, or output operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a relative module 'math_utils'. There is no execution, data handling, or dynamic behavior; it simply sets up functions for later use. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard practice for modular Python code.",
