  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .math_utils import add, subtract\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \n- It performs a standard relative import of two functions (`add` and `subtract`) from a local module `math_utils`.  \n- There are no data flows, no input/output operations, no network activity, and no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Correctly states that the import is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; confirms standard import behavior, no anomalies.  \n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard import, benign.  \n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, confirms benign, straightforward import.  \n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports simply describe the import statement, which is indeed present and unaltered.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** All reports are consistent, accurate, and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior?**  \n  **None.** The code is a static import; no dynamic or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No unwarranted assumptions are made; all reports correctly identify the import as benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code and the unanimous agreement across reports, the overall risk is negligible. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect that it's a benign import but maintaining a minimal risk threshold for safety checks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward relative import of functions from a local module, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is benign. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider that in real-world scenarios, malicious code can sometimes be hidden behind simple import statements, but based on this isolated snippet and reports, there's no evidence of such activity here.",
