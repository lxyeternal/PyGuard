  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .math_utils import add, subtract`. This is a standard Python import of functions from a local module. There is no evidence of data flow, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the code is benign and standard.  \n   - They correctly identify that no data is processed, no untrusted input is handled, and no suspicious activity is present.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statement.  \n   - The `confidence` is 1 in all cases, which is reasonable because the code is simple and unambiguous.  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n   - The reports correctly assign a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   - No malicious behavior is indicated.  \n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's static nature and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
