  "purpose": "The code imports mathematical utility functions, specifically 'add' and 'subtract', from a local module named 'math_utils'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module; no external data sources or input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks; no untrusted data processing or output observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions without executing any data flow or control logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a simple import statement from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network communications. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code structure is standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import statement for utility functions. No malicious intent or security concerns are identified based on this fragment.",
