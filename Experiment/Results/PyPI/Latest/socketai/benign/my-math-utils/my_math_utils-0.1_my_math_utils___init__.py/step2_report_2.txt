  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code is:\n   ```python\n   from .math_utils import add, subtract\n   ```\n   This is a straightforward import statement importing two functions from a local module `math_utils`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data flow, or untrusted input.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Claims**:  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as a simple import statement with no suspicious behavior. They note the absence of data flow, network activity, or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:  \n   The reports do not contain any logical errors or misinterpretations. They are thorough in stating that the code is benign and standard.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - **Confidence**: All reports have a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since no malicious activity is evident.\n\n5. **Potential for Re-evaluation**:  \n   Since the code is a simple import statement, there's no reason to adjust the scores upward. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n6. **Overall Risk and Malware Scores**:  \n   Based on the code snippet and the reports, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
