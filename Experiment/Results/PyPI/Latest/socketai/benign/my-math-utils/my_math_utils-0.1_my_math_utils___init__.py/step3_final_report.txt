  "purpose": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of 'add' and 'subtract' functions from a local module 'math_utils'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.math_utils'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, input/output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import source to functions 'add' and 'subtract' within the module; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple static import statement with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static import of two functions from a local module, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted input. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. The code is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
