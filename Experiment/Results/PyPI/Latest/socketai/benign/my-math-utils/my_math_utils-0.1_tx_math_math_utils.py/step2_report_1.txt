  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code verification**:\n   - The provided code matches the descriptions in all reports. All functions perform standard arithmetic operations with appropriate input validation for division by zero and negative square root inputs.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats are apparent.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify the code as straightforward, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The validation checks are appropriate for the functions' purposes.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and safety.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Risk score justification**:\n   - The overall `securityRisk` score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware score justification**:\n   - The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Potential assumptions or claims**:\n   - All claims are based on direct code analysis, with no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior.\n   - The functions are standard and do not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions.\n- There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Note**: If any future code or reports introduce suspicious patterns or malicious behavior, scores should be revisited accordingly.",
