{
  "purpose": "Provide basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (a, b) receive input values; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output results; no external systems or untrusted data handling are involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, and results are returned directly without external data or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. Functions are straightforward arithmetic operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple arithmetic functions performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root calculations. All functions include basic input validation for division by zero and negative square root scenarios. There are no external data sources, no network calls, no file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of arithmetic functions with proper input validation. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is safe and straightforward.",
