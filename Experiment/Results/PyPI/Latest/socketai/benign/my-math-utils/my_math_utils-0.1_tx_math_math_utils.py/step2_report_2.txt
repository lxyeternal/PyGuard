  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and the scoring, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code provided is a straightforward set of arithmetic functions with basic input validation (division by zero, negative square root). No external data sources, no network calls, no obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- All reports agree that the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n- They correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They mention the proper input validation present.\n- No report claims or implies any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities beyond the basic input validation.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, no security risks, and no obfuscation, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The functions are basic mathematical utilities with proper validation, posing no security threat.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with the code.\n- The code does not exhibit any suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Step 7: Check score consistency**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a set of basic arithmetic functions with proper input validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The consistent conclusions across reports support this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
