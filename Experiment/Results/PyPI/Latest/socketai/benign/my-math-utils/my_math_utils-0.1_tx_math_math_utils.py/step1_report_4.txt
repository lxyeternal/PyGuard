{
  "purpose": "Provide basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (a, b).",
  "sinks": "Return statements, which output the result or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b) flow into arithmetic operations, then results flow to return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The functions perform straightforward calculations with simple input validation for division by zero and negative square root.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard arithmetic functions with basic input validation for division by zero and negative square root. There are no external data sources, no network interactions, and no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a simple calculator module without malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides basic arithmetic functions with appropriate input validation and no evidence of malicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
