  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions with input validation for division by zero and square root of negative numbers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for each function.",
  "sinks": "Return statements; no external data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into arithmetic operations and validation checks, then to return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper validation and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard arithmetic functions with appropriate input validation. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are simple, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The validation checks are appropriate, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and correctness justify the assessments and scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of arithmetic functions with proper validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The reports' conclusions and scores are accurate and justified.",
