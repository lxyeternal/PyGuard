  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to each function (a, b) for add, subtract, multiply, divide, power; parameter a for square_root.",
  "sinks": "Return statements with results; no external data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly used in calculations, and results are returned immediately.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward mathematical functions with basic input validation for division by zero and square root of negative numbers. No external data handling, no network activity, and no code obfuscation are present. Functions perform simple arithmetic operations with clear input validation. The structure is simple and conventional, with no suspicious logic or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard mathematical operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a basic utility module with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
