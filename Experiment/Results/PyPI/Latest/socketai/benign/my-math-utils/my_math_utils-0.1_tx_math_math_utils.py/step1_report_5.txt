{
  "purpose": "Provide basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (a, b) for operations; no external data sources or inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Return statements; no untrusted data output, network operations, or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (a, b) to return outputs; no complex data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code performs straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions with simple input validation (e.g., division by zero, square root of negative number). There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The functions do not include any side effects, data leaks, or malicious logic. The implementation is standard and clear.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains straightforward arithmetic functions with proper input validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for mathematical computations.",
