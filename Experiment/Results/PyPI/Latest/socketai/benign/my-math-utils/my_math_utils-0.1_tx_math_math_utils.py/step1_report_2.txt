  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root).",
  "sources": "Function input parameters (a, b).",
  "sinks": "Return statements delivering calculation results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Inputs (a, b) are processed through arithmetic operations and result returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code performs straightforward calculations without external data or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, well-defined mathematical functions. No input validation beyond basic checks (e.g., division by zero, square root of negative) are present, but these are expected for such functions. No external data sources, network communication, or obfuscated code are used. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic mathematical calculations with proper checks for division by zero and negative square root inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
