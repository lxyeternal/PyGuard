  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .math_utils import add, subtract\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a simple import statement from a local module `math_utils`. There are no discrepancies here.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning.**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or anomalies. This assessment aligns with the code snippet, which is just an import statement.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which makes sense given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \nNo report assigns a risk score above 0. Given the code's simplicity, this is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Examine malware scores critically.**  \nSince the code only imports functions from a local module, there's no indication of malicious activity. Malware score 0 is justified.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency of scores with the report content.**  \nScores are consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- Since the code is a simple import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.  \n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious behavior or code execution is present.  \n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- There are no external data flows or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, and the reports are accurate in their assessments.",
