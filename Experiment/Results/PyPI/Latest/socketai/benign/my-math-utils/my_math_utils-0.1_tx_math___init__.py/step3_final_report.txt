  "purpose": "Import functions 'add' and 'subtract' from a local module 'math_utils'.",
  "sources": "Local module 'math_utils' within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network communication, or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import statement establishes a static reference; no runtime data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of two functions from a local module. It involves no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import statement. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard and safe. The existing reports and scores are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
