  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .math_utils import add, subtract\n     ```\n   - There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or external communication.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no malicious activity, a `securityRisk` of 0 is justified.\n   - Similarly, `malware` score of 0 is appropriate because there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores upward.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there's no malware activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 aligns with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, the import statement is benign. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The assessment accurately reflects the code's harmless nature.",
