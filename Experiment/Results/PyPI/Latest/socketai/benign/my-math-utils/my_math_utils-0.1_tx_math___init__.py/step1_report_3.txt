{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions 'add' and 'subtract' from a local module 'math_utils', likely to perform mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'math_utils' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with only import statements; no execution flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that loads functions from a local module. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The import appears standard for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import operation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
