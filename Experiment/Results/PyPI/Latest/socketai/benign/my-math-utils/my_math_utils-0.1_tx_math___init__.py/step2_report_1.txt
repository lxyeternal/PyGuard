  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .math_utils import add, subtract\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external data sources, or execution beyond import.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n   - The code is standard for Python projects and involves only local module import.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the minimal nature of the code.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flow, sinks, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code only imports local functions without any data handling or external communication, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified because there's no evidence of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that the code is a simple import statement.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, the overall security risk is negligible.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and presents no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
