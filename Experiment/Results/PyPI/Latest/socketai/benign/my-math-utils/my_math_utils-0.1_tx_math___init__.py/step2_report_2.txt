  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is: `from .math_utils import add,subtract`\n   - All reports confirm that this is a simple import statement from a local module.\n   - There are no indications of data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is a straightforward import with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code only imports functions from a local module.\n   - No malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads, is evident.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond what is supported.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign import statement with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code snippet.",
