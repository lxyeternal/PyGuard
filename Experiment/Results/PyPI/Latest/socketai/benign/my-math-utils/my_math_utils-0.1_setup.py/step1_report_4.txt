{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'my_math_utils', intended to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input source is the setup() function parameters, particularly reading package data via find_packages() and other metadata such as author.",
  "targets": "Targets are the packaging process and the environment where the package is installed; no specific sink points are evident beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains commented-out sections for dependencies and manual package specification, which are typical in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package details, find_packages() to include all packages automatically, and includes optional commented-out configurations for dependencies and package listing. No dynamic code execution, external data reads, or suspicious behavior are present. All code is standard for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
