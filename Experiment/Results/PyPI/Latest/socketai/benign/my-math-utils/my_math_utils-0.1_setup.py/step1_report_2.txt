  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging information for the 'my_math_utils' Python package.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or external data sources in this script).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code suggests manual package specification and dependency declarations; no suspicious or unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to set up a Python package. It automatically finds packages with find_packages(), includes package data, and provides basic metadata such as author and version. The commented lines suggest optional manual configuration of packages and dependencies but do not execute. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not perform any data collection, network communication, or system modifications. No security issues are detected.",
