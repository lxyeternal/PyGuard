{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'my_math_utils'.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from the 'find_packages()' function and commented dependencies, but primarily from the setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted input or data; it only defines packaging parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward setup configuration with comments for optional dependencies and package inclusion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions and calls 'setup' with basic project metadata. The 'find_packages()' function dynamically discovers packages, which is common. Commented lines suggest optional dependencies and explicit package listings but do not execute or pose risks. No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks.",
