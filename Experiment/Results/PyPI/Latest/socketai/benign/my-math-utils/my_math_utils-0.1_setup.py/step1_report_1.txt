  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'my_math_utils' Python package.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; relies on static package information and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present; standard packaging process.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted input or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for dependencies and package specification; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines package metadata, and uses 'find_packages()' to include all subpackages. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Commented code suggests standard setup customization. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
