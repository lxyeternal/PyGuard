{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'my_math_utils' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as package name, version, author; find_packages() function; commented code for dependencies and manual package specification.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; potential concerns could relate to package data inclusion or dependency handling if uncommented, but none are active.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata, package discovery) flows into setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; commented sections for dependencies and package specification are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses setup() to configure package metadata. find_packages() automatically discovers packages in the directory. The commented code suggests optional manual package specification and dependencies, but these are inactive. No code reads external input at runtime, and no untrusted data is processed. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. Overall, this is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It performs package configuration tasks without any suspicious or harmful code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
