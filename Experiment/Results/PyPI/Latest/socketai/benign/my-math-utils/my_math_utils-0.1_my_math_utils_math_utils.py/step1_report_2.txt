{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for each function (a, b).",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output calculation results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in computations; results or error messages are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors present. No use of external data sources or network communication. Error handling is straightforward. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard arithmetic operations with basic input validation (division by zero, square root of negative). There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is simple, clear, and lacks any obfuscation or malicious patterns. The error handling is minimal and appropriate for such functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of arithmetic functions with no detectable malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be benign utility functions.",
