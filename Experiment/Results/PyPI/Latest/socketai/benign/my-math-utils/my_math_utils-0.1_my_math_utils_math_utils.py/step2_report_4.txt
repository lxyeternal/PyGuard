  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n   - Error handling for division by zero and square root of negative numbers is appropriate.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are involved.\n   - All reports confirm these observations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the lack of obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The current `securityRisk` scores are 0.0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No reason exists to increase these scores, as the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) is justified given the thorough and consistent review.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the provided scores.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, benign set of arithmetic functions with proper validation. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the absence of security concerns.",
