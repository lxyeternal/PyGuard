  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The provided code implements basic arithmetic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, and square_root.\n- Error handling for division by zero and square root of negative numbers is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external dependencies, data sources, or suspicious constructs.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic code execution detected.\n- The code appears benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs basic arithmetic with proper validation.\n- No suspicious behavior, external data leaks, or malicious intent is evident.\n- The functions are simple, standard, and do not include obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n**Errors or flaws in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They uniformly conclude the code is benign with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0.0 — correct.\n  - `malware`: 0.0 — correct, no malicious activity detected.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n  - `confidence`: 1.0 — justified, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- The risk score is 0.0 because the code is simple, well-understood, and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n- The malware score is 0.0 because there's no malicious behavior or intent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0.0, matching the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: **0.0**\n- Obfuscated: **0.0**\n- Risk: **0.0**\n\nThe code is a safe, straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions with proper validation, and there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
