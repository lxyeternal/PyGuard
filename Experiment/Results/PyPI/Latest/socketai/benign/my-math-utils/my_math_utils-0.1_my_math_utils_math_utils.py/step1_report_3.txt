{
  "purpose": "Implement basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; functions operate on parameters provided to them.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows directly from function parameters to return statements within each function; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. Functions include basic error handling for division by zero and square root of negative numbers, which are standard checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic arithmetic functions with straightforward implementations and standard input validation. No external input handling, no file or network operations, and no suspicious code or logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The functions are simple mathematical operations with minimal complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of arithmetic functions with proper input validation for division and square root operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. Overall, this appears to be benign and intentionally straightforward.",
