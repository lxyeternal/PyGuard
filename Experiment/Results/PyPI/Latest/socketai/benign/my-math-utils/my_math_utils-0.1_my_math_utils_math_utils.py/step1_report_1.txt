{
  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for operations, and the input 'a' for square root.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the calculation results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, with outputs returned directly; no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple arithmetic operations with basic input validation for division by zero and square root of negative numbers. No external input handling, network activity, or data leaks. No suspicious behavior detected. The code structure is clear and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of arithmetic functions with proper validation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. It appears safe and benign.",
