{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (a, b).",
  "sinks": "Return statements within functions; no external data sinks or data output streams.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, and results are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic. Error messages are simple and inline.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard arithmetic operations with basic input validation for division by zero and square root of negative numbers. There are no external data leaks, no network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs. The functions are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious side effects. There are no suspicious variables, no dynamic code execution, and no indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign set of arithmetic functions with proper handling of common edge cases. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
