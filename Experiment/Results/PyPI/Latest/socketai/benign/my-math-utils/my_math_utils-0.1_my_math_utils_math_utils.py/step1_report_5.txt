{
  "purpose": "Basic mathematical operations implementation including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (a, b). No external data sources or inputs are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing results or error messages; no external data outputs or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical functions and produce outputs; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple arithmetic functions without any external input handling or external system interaction. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The functions do include basic error handling for division by zero and square root of negative numbers, which are appropriate and not suspicious. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden functions, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of basic math functions with proper error handling. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
