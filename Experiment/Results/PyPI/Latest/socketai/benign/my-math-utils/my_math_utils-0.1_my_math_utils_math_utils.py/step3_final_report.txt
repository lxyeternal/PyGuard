  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic functions with validation for division by zero and square root of negative numbers.",
  "sources": "Function parameters a and b, input validation conditions within divide and square_root functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting results or error messages; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, validation checks occur, then results or error messages are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple arithmetic operations with appropriate error handling. No external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The functions are standard, and validation prevents common errors. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent are evident. The code's clarity and simplicity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of arithmetic functions with proper validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. The code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
