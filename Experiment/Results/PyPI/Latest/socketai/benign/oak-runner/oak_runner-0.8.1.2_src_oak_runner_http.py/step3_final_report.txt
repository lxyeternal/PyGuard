  "purpose": "HTTP client wrapper for executing API requests with dynamic parameters and optional authentication.",
  "sources": "URL path parameters, query parameters, headers, cookies, request body payloads, security options for auth resolution.",
  "sinks": "Application of auth headers, query params, cookies, and request data; no external data sinks or network exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (parameters, security options) flow into request construction, auth application, and then to the request execution via requests library.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; debug logs are present but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client supporting dynamic URL parameter substitution, request customization, and optional external authentication. It applies credentials via an auth provider, which is external and not included here, but within this snippet, no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Logging is for debugging purposes and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk with potential concerns if the auth provider is compromised. Malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The overall structure and logic are sound, with no anomalies or vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTTP client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis.",
