  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, parsing, and handling documents, source descriptions, and OpenAPI specs, as well as evaluating JSON pointers and configuring logging.",
  "sources": "File reads (open, yaml.safe_load, json.loads), HTTP GET requests (http_client.get), JSON pointer resolution (jsonpointer.JsonPointer), regex matching for expression parsing.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code reads external data but does not write or transmit untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (files, HTTP responses) are processed through parsing functions and JSON pointer evaluations; no data flows into untrusted sinks or exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard error handling and logging are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility operations: loading files (YAML/JSON), fetching remote resources, parsing JSON pointers, and configuring logs. It handles errors gracefully, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The functions operate within expected parameters for configuration and data handling tasks, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs expected functions safely, with proper error handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by external data handling but no malicious activity.",
