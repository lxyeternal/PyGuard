  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Arazzo documents, loading source descriptions, evaluating JSON pointers, and managing OpenAPI files for the OAK Runner.",
  "sources": "Reading files from local paths, reading response content from HTTP client, reading environment variables (indirectly via os and logging configuration), regex matching on expressions.",
  "sinks": "Reading files (potential data leakage if files contain sensitive info), making HTTP requests (data transmission over network), logging sensitive information, parsing JSON/YAML content (potentially executing malicious payload if data is malicious).",
  "flows": "File reading for source descriptions and OpenAPI files; HTTP client responses flowing into parsing functions; regex-extracted JSON pointers used in data extraction; logging outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard libraries, and no suspicious network behavior or data exfiltration routines are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O operations, JSON/YAML parsing, HTTP GET requests, JSON pointer resolution, and regex matching. It handles both local and remote sources securely with error handling and logging. There is no code that sends data maliciously or attempts to hide behavior. Use of environment variables for configuration (logging level) is typical. The only potential concern is the reading of local files and network content, which is context-dependent but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, no backdoors, no suspicious network connections, or data theft routines are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for document loading and processing, with no malicious behavior detected. It operates with normal security considerations, provided inputs are controlled and trusted. No indicators of malware or malicious intent were found.",
