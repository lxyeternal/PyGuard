  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Arazzo documents, loading source descriptions, evaluating JSON pointers, and handling OpenAPI files within the OAK Runner framework.",
  "sources": "File system reads (open, os.path.exists), HTTP client GET requests, user-provided input parameters (e.g., file paths, expressions).",
  "sinks": "Reading files from disk, fetching remote data via HTTP, parsing YAML/JSON content, logging errors.",
  "flows": "File paths and URLs are sources; data is read from files or HTTP responses; parsed and returned as dictionaries; JSON pointers are evaluated; logs are generated for errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code performs standard data loading, parsing, and logging operations. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O, HTTP requests, and data parsing. It uses well-established libraries such as json, yaml, and jsonpointer. Error handling is in place for file and JSON/YAML parsing issues. The HTTP interactions depend on an external client, but there are no indications of malicious use (e.g., data exfiltration, command execution). The JSON pointer evaluation and expression parsing are standard implementations. The logging is used for debugging and error reporting without exposing sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for loading and parsing configuration files, handling HTTP requests, evaluating JSON pointers, and managing logs. It contains no malicious logic or suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard application code intended for managing configurations and data within the OAK Runner environment.",
