{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, parsing, and handling Arazzo documents, OpenAPI specs, and JSON pointers in the context of the OAK Runner framework.",
  "sources": "File system reads (open, os.path.exists), environment (os.getcwd), HTTP GET requests (http_client.get), JSON and YAML content parsing.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from file reads, HTTP responses, and JSON/YAML parsing; potential misuse could involve processing untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads from files or HTTP responses (sources) are processed and parsed, but no untrusted data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; the code performs standard parsing and file handling operations. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard utility functions for file loading, remote resource fetching, JSON pointer evaluation, and logging configuration. It handles local and remote data sources with appropriate error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. All data handling appears to be limited to reading, parsing, and logging operations, consistent with legitimate utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical utility functions for document and configuration handling within a larger application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
