  "purpose": "Library for executing Arazzo workflows step-by-step and OpenAPI operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .runner and .models",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no external data or untrusted input handling in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that provides a description and imports specific classes and functions for use elsewhere. It only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration, which define what symbols are publicly accessible. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or other potentially risky behaviors present. The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or main module, serving as an API entry point. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an API interface definition with no external data processing or insecure code elements.",
