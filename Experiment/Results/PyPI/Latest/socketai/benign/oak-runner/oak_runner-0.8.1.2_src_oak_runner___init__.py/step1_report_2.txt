  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module for an 'OAK Runner' library that facilitates executing workflows and OpenAPI operations, primarily by importing classes and functions from other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .runner, .models",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "The code only imports and exports symbols; there are no data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. The module appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple module initialization script, importing classes and functions for use elsewhere. There are no input handling, data processing, or execution commands. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It only manages imports and exports for a library.",
