  "purpose": "Defines a library for executing Arazzo workflows and OpenAPI operations, exposing certain classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.runner, .models), likely internal modules of the package.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being sent over network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes and functions from internal modules and exposing them via __all__. There are no suspicious patterns, no input reading, and no potentially dangerous operations. It functions as an index or entry point for the package. No malicious or maliciously intended code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple module initializer for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
