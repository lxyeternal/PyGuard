  "purpose": "A module for executing Arazzo workflows step-by-step and OpenAPI operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.runner' and '.models'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements only; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export module with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, likely an __init__.py, importing classes and defining __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code serves purely as an API interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer that exports classes for use elsewhere. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
