  "purpose": "Provides a public API for executing Arazzo workflows and OpenAPI operations via importing classes and functions from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: .runner and .models",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no external network, file, or environment variable access observed",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior present; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a descriptive docstring, imports specific classes from internal modules, and specifies exports via __all__. It is a typical package initialization file with no apparent malicious code or risky behavior. No external data sources or sinks are invoked. The code structure and content are consistent with a standard library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an API interface for other modules. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
