  "purpose": "To provide a library interface for executing Arazzo workflows and OpenAPI operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.runner and .models), no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the code mainly exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and defines the public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It functions as a typical Python package __init__.py file for organizing exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization file with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
