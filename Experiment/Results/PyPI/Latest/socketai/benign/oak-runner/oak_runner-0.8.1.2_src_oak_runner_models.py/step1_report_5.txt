  "purpose": "Defines data models and enums for OAK Runner workflow system.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; internal definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources; internal data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard enum and dataclass usage.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes structured data models with enums for workflow statuses and actions. No input/output operations, network connections, or data processing that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The implementation appears to be purely structural, serving as part of a larger system without any malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of data structures and enums with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
