  "purpose": "Define data models and enums for the OAK Runner workflow system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely establishes data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python data class and enum definitions for modeling workflow states. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. It uses type annotations and default initializations appropriately. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models for workflow management, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
