{
  "purpose": "Define data models and enums for the OAK Runner workflow system",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; defines static classes and type annotations",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static data model definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class and enum definitions to model workflow states, actions, and statuses. There are no dynamic operations, no external data inputs, no network communications, and no code execution based on untrusted inputs. The only potential concern is the default mutable arguments in the 'ExecutionState' dataclass, which are handled correctly by setting None defaults and initializing in __post_init__, avoiding common mutable default argument pitfalls. Overall, the code is straightforward, purely declarative, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data modeling module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines enums and data classes for workflow management.",
