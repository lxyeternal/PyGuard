  "purpose": "Defines data models and enums for managing workflow states and actions within the OAK Runner system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines internal data structures and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper handling of mutable defaults in __post_init__.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for step statuses and action types, and a data class 'ExecutionState' to model workflow execution state. It uses standard Python idioms, including safe initialization of mutable attributes. No external input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is purely structural, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The handling of mutable defaults via __post_init__ is correct and does not pose security risks. The reports uniformly conclude benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data model module for workflow management, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
