  "purpose": "Define data models and enums for the OAK Runner workflow system",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and enum definitions, class attribute initializations",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code only defines data structures",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no executable logic that processes external data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior; code is straightforward data modeling",
  "analysis": "The code provides data class and enum definitions to model workflow states and actions. It imports standard modules, defines enums for step statuses and action types, and a data class for execution state with default initializations. There is no processing of external input, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be purely for data modeling within a workflow system, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, non-malicious data structure definitions for workflow management. No security risks or malicious behavior are identified.",
