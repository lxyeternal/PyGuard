{
  "purpose": "Define data models and enums used by the OAK Runner workflow system.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, enum, and typing modules; class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code processes untrusted data or external input directly.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code mainly defines static data structures and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of data models using dataclasses and enums. It initializes default values for internal dictionaries to prevent mutable default arguments. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no code execution, and no suspicious constructs. All classes and variables are purely structural, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structural data model for a workflow system. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
