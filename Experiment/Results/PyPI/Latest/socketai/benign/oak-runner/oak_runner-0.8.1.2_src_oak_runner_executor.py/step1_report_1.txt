{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point for the OAK Runner executor component, primarily re-exporting the StepExecutor class for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the script's shebang line, a docstring, and imports a class from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the shebang to the docstring, then to the import statement, which makes the StepExecutor class available for other modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a simple module with a shebang, a docstring explaining its purpose, and an import statement to re-export a class. It appears to be part of a larger package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. No sources or sinks are identified that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity. Its structure and content are standard for Python packages that provide backward compatibility or simplified imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module re-export for better maintainability. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
