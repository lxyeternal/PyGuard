{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point or interface for the OAK Runner executor, primarily for backward compatibility and re-exporting the StepExecutor class.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local package 'executor.step_executor' and the shebang line at the top.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The shebang indicates script execution, but no data flows or untrusted inputs are processed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and primarily contains documentation and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a shebang line indicating it can be executed directly, but it does not perform any processing, input handling, or network activity. It imports a class from a local package and re-exports it, serving as a simple interface or module initializer. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that serves as a re-export for maintainability. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended without performing any sensitive or harmful operations.",
