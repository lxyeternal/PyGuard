{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module that re-exports the StepExecutor class for backward compatibility and references its refactoring into a package structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local package '.executor.step_executor' and the shebang line indicating execution as a script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a shebang line, a docstring explaining module refactoring, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration for backward compatibility. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a simple re-export wrapper without any malicious or security risks. It facilitates backward compatibility following refactoring but does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
