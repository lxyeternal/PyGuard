{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for executing steps within the OAK Runner framework, primarily by importing and re-exporting the StepExecutor class.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The comment indicates a refactoring to a package structure but does not introduce malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, likely part of a larger package. It only re-exports the class for backward compatibility. There are no input/output operations, no network activity, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns. The structure and comments suggest normal refactoring for maintainability, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module serving as a wrapper or interface within a larger framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
