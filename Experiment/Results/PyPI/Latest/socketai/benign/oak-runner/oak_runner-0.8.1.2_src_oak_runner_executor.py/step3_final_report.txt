  "purpose": "Re-export the StepExecutor class for backward compatibility within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .executor.step_executor import StepExecutor",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to __all__ declaration; no data flow involving external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with a shebang, a docstring, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It serves as a backward compatibility wrapper, re-exporting StepExecutor. No dynamic execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The code structure is standard for package interface modules. All signals indicate benign, non-malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple re-export module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and no modifications are necessary.",
