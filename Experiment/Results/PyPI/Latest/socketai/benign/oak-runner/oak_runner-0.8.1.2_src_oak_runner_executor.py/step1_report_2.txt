  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only imports and re-exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that documents its refactoring into a package. It imports a class from a relative path and re-exports it. There are no input sources, no data processing, no untrusted data flows, and no suspicious code behavior. The comments clarify maintainability improvements but do not introduce any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
