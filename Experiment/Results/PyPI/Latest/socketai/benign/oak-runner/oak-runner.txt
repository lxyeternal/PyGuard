      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard expression evaluator with comprehensive support for nested data and JSON pointers. The primary security concern is the use of 'eval' without input validation, which could be exploited if malicious expressions are evaluated. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified at 0, while the security risk score should be high (~0.75). Implementing safer expression parsing or sandboxed evaluation methods would mitigate this risk."

It relies on external, presumably safe modules, and its data flows are typical for such systems. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate."

The security risk is moderate, estimated around 0.4, due to potential injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation and sandboxing of ExpressionEvaluator are recommended to mitigate risks."
