  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, well-implemented CLI wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a typical safe CLI tool relying on external libraries."
