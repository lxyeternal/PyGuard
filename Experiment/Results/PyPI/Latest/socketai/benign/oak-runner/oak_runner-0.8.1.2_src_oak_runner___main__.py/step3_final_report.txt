  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for managing and executing workflows via the OAKRunner class, handling argument parsing, input validation, and delegating core operations.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, JSON strings for inputs, file paths for Arazzo or OpenAPI specifications.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to external OAKRunner class, printing outputs, sys.exit() calls for process termination.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> Argument parser -> Validation -> Runner initialization -> Method invocation (e.g., execute_workflow, execute_operation) -> Output processing -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that parses user inputs, validates JSON, initializes an external runner object, and calls its methods. It handles errors gracefully and terminates appropriately. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. External dependencies (OAKRunner) are assumed safe but should be reviewed separately. The code does not perform dynamic code execution or data exfiltration, and all logic is explicit and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, well-implemented CLI wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a typical safe CLI tool relying on external libraries.",
