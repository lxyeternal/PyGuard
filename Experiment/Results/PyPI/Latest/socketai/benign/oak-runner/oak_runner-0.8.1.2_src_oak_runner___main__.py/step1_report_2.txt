  "purpose": "Command-line interface for managing and executing workflows in the Arazzo workflow runner, including operations like showing environment mappings, executing workflows or operations, and generating examples.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments, including paths to YAML or OpenAPI files, workflow IDs, operation IDs, and JSON input strings.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing functions, print statements, and sys.exit() calls. No direct data sinks such as network or file writes are present. Potentially unsafe JSON parsing or command construction could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no explicit injection points are found.",
  "flows": "User inputs (paths, IDs, JSON strings) are parsed and passed to the runner's methods for processing. Inputs are converted into data structures, which are then used for workflow execution, description, or example generation. No data leaks or external network flows are explicitly observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No suspicious or backdoor code is detected. JSON input handling is straightforward. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution patterns are present. The code relies heavily on external files and user input, but these are standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a CLI wrapper around the OAKRunner class, initializing runners based on user-specified files and executing commands accordingly. All input parsing is done via argparse, with JSON parsing for input data. No network connections, system manipulations, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms are implemented. Exception handling and logging are standard. The code does not perform any malicious actions; it solely facilitates workflow management. The use of JSON for inputs is controlled, and all data is used in function calls that are part of the external runner. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for workflow management and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It processes user inputs to invoke functions of the external OAKRunner class, which itself should be reviewed separately for security issues. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows within this script.",
