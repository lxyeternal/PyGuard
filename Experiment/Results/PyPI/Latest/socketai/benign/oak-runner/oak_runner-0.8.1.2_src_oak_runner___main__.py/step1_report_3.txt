  "purpose": "Command-line interface for managing and executing workflows in the Arazzo workflow runner.",
  "sources": "Input arguments from command line, JSON strings provided via --inputs, file paths for Arazzo and OpenAPI specifications.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing, JSON string outputs, print statements for workflow details and commands, sys.exit calls based on execution outcomes.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs -> Argument parsing -> Runner initialization -> Workflow or operation execution -> Output printing and exit codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. JSON inputs and outputs are handled securely. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments securely via argparse, avoiding eval or exec functions. Runner initialization is based solely on file paths provided as arguments, with no external or untrusted data sources. JSON inputs are parsed with validation, and outputs are printed to stdout. The flow involves initializing the runner from specified files, executing workflows or operations, and printing results or errors. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All sensitive handling appears to be straightforward and secure within the given scope. The code uses standard libraries and clear control flow. There is a consistent pattern of error handling and logging. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a secure, well-structured command-line interface for managing workflows. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The design focuses on safe argument parsing, proper error handling, and clear output. No indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks are present.",
