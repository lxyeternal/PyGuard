  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard CLI wrapper around the OAKRunner class.\n- They emphasize proper argument parsing, JSON input handling, and invoking runner methods.\n- No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected across reports.\n- The malware scores are uniformly 0, with confidence levels ranging from 0.9 to 0.95.\n- The security risks are minimal, mostly around standard JSON parsing and file handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code employs proper exception handling, input validation, and safe method invocation.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** No obfuscation or malware signs are present.\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n  - **Risk Score:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, given the standard nature of CLI handling and reliance on external runner methods.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All claims are based on standard argument parsing and method calls; no assumptions of malicious activity are made.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis; no overestimation of risk or malware.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The code does not execute untrusted code dynamically.\n- JSON inputs are parsed carefully, with error handling.\n- No network activity or external data exfiltration is evident.\n- The code acts as a controlled interface to an external library (`OAKRunner`), which should be reviewed separately for internal security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                   |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0               | No malicious activity or malware signatures detected.                                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0               | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation patterns.                                    |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1–0.2           | Minimal risk; standard CLI handling, no secrets stored or transmitted insecurely.          |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The external `OAKRunner` class's internal security posture is outside this code scope. This script, as a CLI wrapper, is well-structured and secure based on the provided analysis.",
