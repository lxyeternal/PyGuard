  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but relies on dynamic expression evaluation that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The security risk is moderate, estimated around 0.4, due to potential injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation and sandboxing of ExpressionEvaluator are recommended to mitigate risks."
