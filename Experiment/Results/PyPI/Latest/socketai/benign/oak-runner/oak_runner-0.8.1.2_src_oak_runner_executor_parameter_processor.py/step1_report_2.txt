{
  "purpose": "The code processes parameters and request bodies for API operations, resolving expressions, handling templates, and preparing data for requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'step' parameters, request_body payloads, and 'inputs' dictionary; environment variables are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "Data is manipulated within local variables and returned; no direct data leaks or network connections are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through expression evaluation and template replacement, then organized into request parameters and bodies, but no external sinks or untrusted data exploits are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex expression evaluations and template replacements but does not handle or sanitize data from untrusted sources explicitly; however, it relies on external ExpressionEvaluator without visible safeguards, which might pose risks if malicious inputs are processed.",
  "analysis": "The code evaluates string parameters for expressions and templates, processes nested objects and lists, and replaces target values in payloads and request parameters. It handles dependency expressions, JSON payloads, and expression evaluation. No network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of eval-like expression evaluation could be risky if the ExpressionEvaluator processes untrusted input maliciously. The code appears designed for flexible parameter handling with potential for injection if malicious expressions are provided, but there are no explicit malicious behaviors or backdoors. Overall, it mainly handles data transformations without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs extensive expression evaluation and template processing to prepare API request parameters and bodies. While complex, it does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. Risks depend on the security of the ExpressionEvaluator and the trustworthiness of input data. No external malicious activities or backdoors are observed.",
