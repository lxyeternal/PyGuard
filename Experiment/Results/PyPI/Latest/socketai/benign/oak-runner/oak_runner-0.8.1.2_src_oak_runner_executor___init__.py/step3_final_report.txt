{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or index, importing internal components related to workflow execution and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements of internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The data flow is limited to importing internal modules and exporting symbols via __all__, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports several internal components and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains only import statements, a docstring, and an export list. There are no functions, data processing, user input handling, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup file. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
