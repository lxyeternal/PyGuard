{
  "purpose": "To serve as a module for executing workflow steps in Arazzo workflows, providing functions and imports related to workflow execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .action_handler, .operation_finder, .output_extractor, .parameter_processor, .step_executor, .success_criteria",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external untrusted data outputs are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Imports are from local modules; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python module; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a docstring explaining its purpose, imports several internal modules, and specifies exported symbols in __all__. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies present. It appears to be a typical Python package module setup for a workflow engine.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious module setup with no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk. It merely defines imports and exports for other components.",
