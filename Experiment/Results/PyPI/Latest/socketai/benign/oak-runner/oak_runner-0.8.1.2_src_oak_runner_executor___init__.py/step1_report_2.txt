{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an executor component for OAK Runner workflows, providing functions to handle various workflow steps.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules related to action handling, operation finding, output extraction, parameter processing, step execution, and success criteria checking.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly present in this code; it primarily sets up module imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a module initializer, importing specific classes and defining exported symbols. It contains no runtime logic, user input handling, or network interactions. All imported modules seem related to workflow execution, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, and there is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup file, importing and exposing workflow-related classes without any malicious behavior or security issues. It poses no security risk.",
