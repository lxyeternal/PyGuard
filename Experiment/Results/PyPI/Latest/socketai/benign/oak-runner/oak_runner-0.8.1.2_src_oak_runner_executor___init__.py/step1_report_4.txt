  "purpose": "Provides module metadata and imports for executing workflow steps in Arazzo workflows.",
  "sources": "No input sources; imports modules from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward module setup and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a module docstring, import statements, and an __all__ list defining exported components. There are no data inputs, no function definitions, no dynamic code execution, no credential handling, or other suspicious patterns. It seems to serve as a simple module index or initializer for a larger workflow framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import hub with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
