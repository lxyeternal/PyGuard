  "purpose": "This module serves as an executor for workflow steps in Arazzo workflows, providing a structured way to handle various aspects such as actions, operations, outputs, parameters, and success criteria.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: ActionHandler, OperationFinder, OutputExtractor, ParameterProcessor, StepExecutor, SuccessCriteriaChecker.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not process untrusted data, execute commands, or handle sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The code primarily involves importing modules and defining the __all__ list; there are no data flows or execution flows involving untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module definition that imports several components related to workflow execution. It defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no functions, user input handling, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The module is part of a larger system and acts as a namespace aggregator without executing any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving as a module aggregator for workflow components. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code structure is standard, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities.",
