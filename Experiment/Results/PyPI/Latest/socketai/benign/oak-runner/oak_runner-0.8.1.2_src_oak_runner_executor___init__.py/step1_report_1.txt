  "purpose": "The code defines an executor module for OAK Runner, providing imports for workflow execution components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package (.action_handler, .operation_finder, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no user input or external data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows or untrusted data sources; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module that imports classes/functions from other modules within the same package and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard package component setup with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup file that imports internal components and declares public interfaces. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
