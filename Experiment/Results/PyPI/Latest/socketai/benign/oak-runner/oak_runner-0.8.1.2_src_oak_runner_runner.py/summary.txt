  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured workflow execution engine with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It relies on external, presumably safe modules, and its data flows are typical for such systems. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate."
