  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the open source dependency code.",
  "sources": "Code reading input, environment variables, network sockets, file I/O, user input, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variables, system commands, eval/exec execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into eval/exec/system calls or network transmissions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IPs, use of eval/exec, unvalidated input, unsafe system calls, network activity with suspicious endpoints, lack of input validation, unsafe practices like unprotected environment variable access.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded IP addresses, dynamic code execution via eval/exec, unvalidated user input, and network activity with suspicious endpoints. In absence of code, benign assessments are supported by lack of suspicious patterns. The scores reflect these observations: high malware and security risk for code with malicious indicators, moderate for unsafe practices without confirmed payloads, and low for benign or absent code. The confidence levels correspond to the evidence strength, with higher confidence in code exhibiting multiple malicious signs.",
  "conclusion": "The evaluation indicates that some code snippets demonstrate malicious behaviors (e.g., hardcoded IPs, eval/exec, network exfiltration), justifying high malware and security risk scores. Other snippets lack evidence of malicious activity, warranting low scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments to better reflect the severity of unsafe practices in some reports.",
