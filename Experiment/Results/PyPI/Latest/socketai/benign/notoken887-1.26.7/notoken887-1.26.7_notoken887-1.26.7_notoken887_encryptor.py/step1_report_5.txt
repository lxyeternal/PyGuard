{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, likely for obfuscation or simple encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements; no external data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with emojis in encrypt() → output encrypted string; encrypted string → replace emojis with characters in decrypt() → output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive replacement operations for character encoding/decoding; no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward substitution cipher using emojis for characters, with parallel replace calls in encrypt() and decrypt(). There are no input validation, external data access, or system commands. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. The approach is simple obfuscation without any harmful intent. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected beyond basic string replacements.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic substitution cipher with emojis for character encoding. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears solely for obfuscation or novelty purposes without malicious intent.",
