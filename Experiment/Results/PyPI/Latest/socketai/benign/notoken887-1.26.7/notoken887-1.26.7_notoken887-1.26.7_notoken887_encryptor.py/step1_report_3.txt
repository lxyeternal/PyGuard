{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings to transform them via character replacements.",
  "sinks": "The output is the transformed string, but there are no external sinks or data leaks directly in this code.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with emojis (encrypt) → output emoji string; Emoji string → replace emojis with characters (decrypt) → output decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements without any obfuscated or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The replacements are static and predictable. The code lacks any network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The class offers a simple reversible character substitution cipher using emojis as tokens. Both encrypt and decrypt methods perform a series of static replace calls to convert characters to emojis and back. There are no external inputs besides the input strings, and no outputs or actions suggest malicious intent. The absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious side effects indicates a benign utility for obfuscation or encoding, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution scheme for encoding and decoding strings. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware indicators, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with no suspicious activity.",
