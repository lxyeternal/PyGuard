{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by substituting characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via method parameters 'string' for encryption and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code performs replacements within string data; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via sequential replace operations during encrypt and decrypt processes, with no external data flow beyond method scope.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward character replacement with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The implementation is a simple substitution cipher using emojis. It performs direct character replacements for encoding and decoding, without any dynamic execution, network activity, or external dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable. The code does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or malicious modifications beyond the apparent encoding scheme.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a harmless character substitution cipher with no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is likely intended for obfuscation or playful encoding, not malicious purposes.",
