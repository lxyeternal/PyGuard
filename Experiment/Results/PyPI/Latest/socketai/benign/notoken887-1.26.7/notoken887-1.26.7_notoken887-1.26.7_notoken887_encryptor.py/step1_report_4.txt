{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple substitution cipher methods to encrypt and decrypt text messages by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input data is taken from the method argument 'string' for encryption and 'encrypted_token' for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that send or leak data externally; it only performs in-memory replacements.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into the 'encrypt' method and is transformed into an emoji-based string; the reverse flow occurs in 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character replacement for encryption/decryption without any complex or hidden mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. No external network communication, file operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The implementation is a simple static substitution cipher, replacing each character with a predefined emoji or symbol. Both methods are symmetrical, with consistent mappings. The code performs direct string replacements, which are transparent and not malicious. No signs of malware, data theft, or sabotage are present. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or obfuscated behavior. The use of emojis is consistent and does not involve any external dependencies or runtime modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a basic character-to-emoji substitution cipher for obfuscation or aesthetic purposes. It poses no security threats, malicious behaviors, or supply chain risks. The implementation is transparent and benign.",
