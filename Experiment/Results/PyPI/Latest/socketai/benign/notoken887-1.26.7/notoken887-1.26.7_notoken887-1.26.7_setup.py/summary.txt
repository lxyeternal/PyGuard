  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; the primary concern is the suspicious metadata which could be exploited socially. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores remain 0, with a slight elevation in security risk due to metadata. Recommendations include updating metadata for professionalism but no security issues are detected."
