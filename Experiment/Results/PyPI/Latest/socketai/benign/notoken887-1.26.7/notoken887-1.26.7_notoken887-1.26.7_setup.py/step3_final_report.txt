  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') as provocative or unprofessional metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic or executable logic. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional author email and URL, which do not constitute malicious code but could be used for social engineering or reputation damage. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The security risk score around 0.2 is justified due to metadata concerns but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; the primary concern is the suspicious metadata which could be exploited socially. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores remain 0, with a slight elevation in security risk due to metadata. Recommendations include updating metadata for professionalism but no security issues are detected.",
