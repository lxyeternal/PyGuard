  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Data is provided via static configuration parameters within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional; the URL 'https://thugging.org' is questionable and may be malicious or offensive. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static arguments. The parameters define package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behavior is present. The presence of suspicious email and URL raises potential concerns about intent or reputation but does not constitute malicious code. Overall, the script appears to be a standard package setup script with unprofessional or potentially malicious metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no malicious code or behavior. The suspicious email and URL should be reviewed for intent or reputation concerns but do not indicate malware or security risks within the code itself.",
