{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for user input validation and file editing, primarily for modifying specific lines in a text file based on provided criteria.",
  "sources": "Reading the file content with open(file_path, 'r') as file and reading lines via file.readlines()",
  "sinks": "Writing the modified lines back to the file with open(file_path, 'w') as file and file.writelines(filtered_lines)",
  "flows": "Input from file -> read lines -> filter/modify lines based on lines_to_edit and new_lines -> write back to file",
  "anomalies": "The code filters and replaces lines containing specified strings without validation; however, this is standard behavior and not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. Use of questionary for printing messages is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions for validation, logging, and editing files. The edit_line_containing function reads a file, searches for specific lines containing given substrings, replaces those lines with new lines if provided, and rewrites the file. There are no network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No use of untrusted input is evident beyond file content manipulation, which is a common utility task. The logic is straightforward and lacks malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic validation, logging, and file line editing functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module.",
