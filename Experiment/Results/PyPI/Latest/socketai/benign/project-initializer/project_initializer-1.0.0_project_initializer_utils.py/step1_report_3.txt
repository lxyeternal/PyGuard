  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for validation, logging, success/error messages, and editing lines in a file based on specified criteria.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file (file_path), reads user input via questionary Validator, and reads lines for editing.",
  "sinks": "File write operation (writelines) in edit_line_containing; printing to console via questionary.print.",
  "flows": "User input -> Validator.validate -> log/success/error functions -> file read (lines) -> line filtering and replacement -> file write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The line filtering logic appears flawed, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements input validation, logging, and a file editing function. The Validator ensures non-empty input. Logging functions output styled messages. The edit_line_containing function reads a file, filters lines based on whether they contain specified substrings, and replaces matching lines with new lines if provided. However, the filtering logic appends lines that do not contain the target substrings and can duplicate lines, potentially corrupting the file. The code uses standard Python file operations and the questionary library, which is for user prompts. No code injections, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code or malware-like activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for validation, logging, and file editing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The line filtering logic appears flawed but is not malicious.",
