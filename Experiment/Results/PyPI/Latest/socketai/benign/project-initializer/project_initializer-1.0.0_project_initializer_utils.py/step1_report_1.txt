  "purpose": "Provide CLI prompts, validation, and file line editing functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading file contents with open(file_path, 'r')",
  "sinks": "Writing modified lines back to the file with open(file_path, 'w')",
  "flows": "Read file -> process lines -> write file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The line editing logic filters and replaces specific lines based on matching values, which could potentially be misused if input data is controlled maliciously, but no direct malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validator and print functions for CLI interactions, and a function to modify specific lines in a file based on provided criteria. The line editing function reads all lines, filters them based on whether they contain specific substrings, and replaces matched lines with new content if provided. The process involves straightforward file I/O operations without any evident malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The functionality appears to be standard for CLI scripts managing file content.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical CLI input validation and file manipulation tasks without evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
