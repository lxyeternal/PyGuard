  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with a minor typo that could cause runtime errors but no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscated code are absent, and the low security risk reflects the lack of vulnerabilities. Correcting the typo is recommended for proper functionality, but it does not impact security."
