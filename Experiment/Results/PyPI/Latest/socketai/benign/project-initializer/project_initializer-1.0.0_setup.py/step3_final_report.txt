  "anomalies": "Typo in module name 'initilizer' instead of 'initializer' in entry_points",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with dependencies and metadata. The only anomaly is a consistent typo in the entry point module name, which could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present. The dependencies are common packages, and the URL appears legitimate. The execution of the main function depends on the source code of the module, but nothing malicious is evident from this script alone. The typo may prevent proper CLI script execution but is not security-related. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero; security risk is minimal (~0.2) due to the typo potential for operational issues, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with a minor typo that could cause runtime errors but no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscated code are absent, and the low security risk reflects the lack of vulnerabilities. Correcting the typo is recommended for proper functionality, but it does not impact security.",
