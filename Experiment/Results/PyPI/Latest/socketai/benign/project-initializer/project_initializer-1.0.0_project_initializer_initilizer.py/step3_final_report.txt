{
  "purpose": "The code automates project setup by cloning a template repository, creating virtual environments, installing dependencies, and customizing configuration files based on user-selected features for a full-stack web application.",
  "sources": "Cloning from external GitHub repository, user input for project name and features, subprocess commands executing shell scripts, file read/write and move operations.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls with shell=True, file modifications and moves, cloning external repository, editing configuration files.",
  "flows": "User input -> cloning external repo -> subprocess execution -> file operations and modifications -> project setup completion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True without input sanitization, reliance on external unverified repository, multiple file move and edit operations that could be exploited if the external repo is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard automation tasks for project scaffolding, with subprocess calls and file operations that are typical in such scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the reliance on an external repository which could be compromised, and the use of subprocess with shell=True, which can pose command injection risks if inputs are untrusted. However, inputs are limited to project name and feature selections, which are controlled. The code's transparency and lack of malicious logic justify a low malware score. The external dependency and subprocess usage justify a moderate security risk score. No obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate project scaffolding script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security considerations involve external repository trustworthiness and subprocess command execution. These risks are low given controlled inputs but should be monitored in production environments.",
