{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs are from function arguments, environment variables, or imported modules that may handle external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various processing steps to sinks, possibly involving dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs detected. However, unusual code constructs or dynamic execution patterns need further scrutiny.",
  "analysis": "The code’s structure shows typical Python constructs, with imports, function definitions, and possible external data handling. No overt signs of obfuscation or malicious code such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or system damage are evident. Lack of context prevents a definitive conclusion on data sources or sinks, but no suspicious network calls or credential leaks are visible. The code appears benign based on the visible segments, but incomplete analysis due to missing details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code fragment, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard with no evident malware or obfuscation. Confidence remains moderate due to incomplete information, but no signs point to malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
