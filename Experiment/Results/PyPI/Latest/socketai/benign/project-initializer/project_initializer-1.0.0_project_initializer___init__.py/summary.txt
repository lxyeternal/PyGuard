  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,

  "conclusion": "The reports are internally consistent; benign code is correctly scored with low malware and risk, while Report 4's suspicious patterns justify higher scores. The current scoring accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors. An overall low security threat is indicated, with targeted attention needed for code exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic execution."
