      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with a minor typo that could cause runtime errors but no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware and obfuscated code are absent, and the low security risk reflects the lack of vulnerabilities. Correcting the typo is recommended for proper functionality, but it does not impact security."

The primary security considerations involve external repository trustworthiness and subprocess command execution. These risks are low given controlled inputs but should be monitored in production environments."
