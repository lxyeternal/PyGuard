  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Python wrapper around the Sigrok C library, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assessments across the reports are consistent and accurate."
