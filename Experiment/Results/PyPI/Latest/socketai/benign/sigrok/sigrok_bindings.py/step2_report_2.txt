  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described concerns.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code performs platform detection, resource path resolution, configuration retrieval via pkgconfig, and initializes a CLibrary object with header files for 'sigrok'.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The only notable action is a warning logged when cache files are missing, which is a standard initial setup behavior.\n- All reports agree on the code's legitimacy and lack of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Input flows:** No untrusted inputs are processed or used in dangerous ways.\n- **External communication:** No network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Resource access:** Only standard package resources and configuration variables are used.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), as the code performs standard setup routines without exposing vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The high confidence levels (0.9–1.0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed to scores; they align with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (low, due to initial cache warning, which is benign)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script for cross-platform loading of C libraries and headers for 'sigrok'. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, nor does it process untrusted inputs or communicate externally. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports. The code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
