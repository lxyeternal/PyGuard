{
  "purpose": "Set up platform-specific paths, load header files, and initialize a C library parser for 'sigrok' across different operating systems.",
  "sources": "Resource files within package (libsigrok, include directories), configuration variables from pkgconfig, environment detection via sys.platform",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or transmit data externally",
  "flows": "Platform detection → resource path resolution → header file paths → cache file check → CLibrary initialization",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard resource management and platform detection",
  "analysis": "The code performs cross-platform detection, resource path resolution, configuration retrieval, and initializes a C library parser with header files. It uses standard libraries and patterns, logs a warning if cache is missing, and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, setup-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward setup routine for cross-platform native library loading. It poses no security threats, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the low risk and malware scores are justified.",
