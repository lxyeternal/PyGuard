  "purpose": "Importing the 'log_to_mlflow' function from a local module 'mlflow_logger' for logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'mlflow_logger' when attempting to import 'log_to_mlflow'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement, no data flow or execution logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import statement; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet imports a function from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. There is no code execution, data handling, or network activity shown. As it only shows an import statement, there are no evident security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase.",
