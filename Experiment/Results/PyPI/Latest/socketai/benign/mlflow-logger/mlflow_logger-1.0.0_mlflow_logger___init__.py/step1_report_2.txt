  "purpose": "Import a function 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module 'mlflow_logger'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'log_to_mlflow' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; only an import statement, no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function from a local module, indicating a likely logging utility related to MLflow. No data input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The module name suggests integration with MLflow, but nothing malicious or suspicious is evident from this single import statement. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and typical for a logging setup in a larger project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
