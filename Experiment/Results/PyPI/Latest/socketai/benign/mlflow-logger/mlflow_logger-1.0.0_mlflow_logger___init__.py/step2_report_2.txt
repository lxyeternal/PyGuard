  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .mlflow_logger import log_to_mlflow\n```\nThis is a standard Python import from a local module, likely for logging or experiment tracking with MLflow.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**  \n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a logging utility.\n\n3. **Data Flows & External Interactions**  \n- The import itself does not perform any data flow, network communication, or data processing.\n- No untrusted data handling or external output is evident in these snippets.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, aligning with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the import statement.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**  \n- Since the code only imports a function, any risk would stem from what that function does at runtime, which is not shown here.\n- If `log_to_mlflow` internally performs malicious actions, that would be outside the scope of this import statement. But based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the minimal code snippet.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n**Overall Assessment & My Own Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the possibility that the imported function could perform malicious actions at runtime, but there's no evidence here)\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports correctly identify this as benign code. The only caveat is that the actual behavior of `log_to_mlflow` at runtime could introduce risks, but that cannot be assessed from this import statement alone.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, standard, and low-risk.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as is unless additional context about `log_to_mlflow` is provided.",
