  "purpose": "Importing a logging function from a local module for tracking or recording data, likely related to MLflow.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.mlflow_logger'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this single line of import; it only imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected in the import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a function named 'log_to_mlflow' from a local module. It appears to be part of a larger codebase intended for logging or experiment tracking. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code are present. As it is just an import statement, it cannot perform any malicious actions by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for logging in ML workflows.",
