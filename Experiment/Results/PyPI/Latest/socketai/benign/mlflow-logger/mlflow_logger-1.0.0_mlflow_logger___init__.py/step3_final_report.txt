  "purpose": "Import the log_to_mlflow function from a local module for MLflow experiment tracking.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .mlflow_logger",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The import brings in a function, but no data flow or execution occurs in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No suspicious behavior or external interactions are evident. The function's implementation is unknown, but the import itself is safe. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard and safe. Current scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.",
