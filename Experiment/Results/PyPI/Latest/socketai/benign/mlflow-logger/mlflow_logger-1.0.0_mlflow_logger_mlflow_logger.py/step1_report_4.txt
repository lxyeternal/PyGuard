{
  "purpose": "This code handles validation and logging of experiment parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow tracking server for machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI', input parameters 'experiment_name', 'params_map', 'metrics_map', 'artifact_paths', and accesses files on disk via 'os.path.exists' and 'os.walk'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'mlflow' library functions to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts, which could potentially process untrusted data if supplied maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and function inputs through validation steps into MLflow logging functions, with filesystem checks before artifact logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials. The code performs standard validation and logging tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with environment variable access and input validation, then configures MLflow tracking. It logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts after verifying file existence, using standard 'mlflow' API calls. No unsafe code patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. It does not contain obfuscation or hidden code. All actions are typical for ML experiment logging. The only potential concern is the handling of artifacts and environment variables, which depend on user input and configuration, but these are standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward MLflow logging utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It adheres to typical usage patterns without suspicious behavior or security risks.",
