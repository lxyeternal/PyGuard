  "purpose": "A utility script for validating inputs and logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow during machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI', function input parameters (experiment_name, params_map, metrics_map, artifact_paths), filesystem (artifact paths).",
  "sinks": "MLflow API calls (set_tracking_uri, set_experiment, log_param, log_metric, log_artifact), environment variable access, filesystem checks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable provides tracking URI → set_tracking_uri; input parameters validated and passed to MLflow functions; filesystem checked before artifact logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or network activity. Artifact handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, retrieves configuration from environment variables, and logs data to MLflow. It includes filesystem checks before artifact logging, and exception handling for robustness. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of environment variables and filesystem access is typical for such utilities. Metrics are converted to float assuming numeric input, which is standard. Overall, the code is a straightforward, benign MLflow utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured MLflow logging utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
