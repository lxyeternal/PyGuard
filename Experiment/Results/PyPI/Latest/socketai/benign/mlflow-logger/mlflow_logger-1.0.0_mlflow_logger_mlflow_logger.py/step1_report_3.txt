{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts to an MLflow experiment, primarily for machine learning workflow tracking.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' for tracking URI; function parameters: 'experiment_name', 'params_map', 'metrics_map', 'artifact_paths'; user input or external data passed to these functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, MLflow API calls (log_param, log_metric, log_artifact), file system access for artifacts, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI' flows into mlflow.set_tracking_uri; function inputs flow into validation and logging steps; validated inputs are used directly in mlflow functions; artifacts are read from disk and sent to mlflow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Logging and file operations are standard. No obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard MLflow logging with input validation, environment variable reliance, and artifact handling. It does not include any data exfiltration, network communication outside MLflow, or system manipulation. Use of environment variables and file system is typical and safe. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for MLflow tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional MLflow logging utility without any malicious intent. It relies on environment variables for configuration, performs standard file and network operations, and contains no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
