  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code simply imports `setup` and `find_packages` from setuptools and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or code obfuscation are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified in the logic or reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- Since all reports are unanimous and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is benign and typical for package setup.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus in the reports.",
