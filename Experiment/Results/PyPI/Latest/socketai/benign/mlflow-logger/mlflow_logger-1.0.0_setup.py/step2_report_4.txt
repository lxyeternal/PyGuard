  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No external data, dynamic code, or execution of untrusted input is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code snippets in the reports match the original code provided.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound: the script is a typical setup configuration.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Since the code is straightforward and standard, there are no anomalies, flaws, or suspicious behaviors to challenge.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment, with confidence levels at 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk: 0; no vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a normal setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- No issues, no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and no further action is needed.",
