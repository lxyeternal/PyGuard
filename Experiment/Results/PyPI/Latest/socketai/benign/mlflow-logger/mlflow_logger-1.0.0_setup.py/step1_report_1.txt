  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'mlflow_logger' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup configuration does not read external input or data).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no execution of untrusted data or external commands).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to configure packaging details. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and classifiers. No code execution, data input, or network operations are present. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It is a normal part of package distribution and does not pose any security risks.",
