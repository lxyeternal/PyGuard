  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'mlflow_logger' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, and classifiers; it also uses find_packages() to include project packages.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no functions or operations that process or execute data from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script only prepares package metadata for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. It specifies package name, version, description, author details, classifiers, and Python version requirements. No code execution, dynamic imports, or external data handling present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
