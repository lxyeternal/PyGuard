{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application, importing and invoking the 'app' function from the 'cli' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own local module 'cli' and calls the 'app' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'app' function call may execute further code, but within this snippet, there are no direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The main() function calls 'app()', which could process input or perform actions based on the implementation of 'app'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious variables, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. There is no evidence of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'app' from a relative module 'cli' and defines a main() function that calls 'app()'. The typical pattern indicates this is a CLI entry point. Since there are no parameters, no input processing, and no dynamic execution, the code itself is simple and standard. Without inspecting the 'cli' module, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code does not include any external data sources or sinks, and it lacks any suspicious constructs or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard entry point for a CLI application, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a straightforward wrapper to invoke 'app' from the 'cli' module.",
