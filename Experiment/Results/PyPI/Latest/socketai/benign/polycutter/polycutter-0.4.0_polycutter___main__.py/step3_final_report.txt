  "purpose": "A minimal CLI entry point that imports 'app' from a local module and executes it when run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module; invocation of app() within main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of app() function; potential for app() to perform actions based on its implementation",
  "flows": "Code flow from import -> main() -> app() execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI pattern, importing 'app' and executing it in the main guard. No data processing, input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'app()' in the 'cli' module, which is not provided. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk based solely on this snippet. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code and appropriately avoid assumptions about 'app()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of 'app()'. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary based on this snippet.",
