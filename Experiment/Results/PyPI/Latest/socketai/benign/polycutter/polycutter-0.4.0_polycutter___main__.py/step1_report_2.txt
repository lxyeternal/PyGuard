{
  "purpose": "This code imports and runs a CLI application, likely for user interaction or command execution.",
  "sources": "Import from .cli module, specifically the 'app' object.",
  "sinks": "Calling app() function, which could potentially execute code within that function.",
  "flows": "Import of 'app' from .cli → invocation of app() in main() → execution of any code within app().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports an 'app' object from a local module '.cli' and executes it within the main() function when run as the main module. The code appears to be a typical entry point for a command-line interface application. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The security risk depends on the implementation of 'app' within the '.cli' module, which is not provided here. Based solely on this code, there is no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions as a simple entry point for a CLI application without any apparent malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risks are minimal from this fragment alone; further review should be done on the 'app' implementation inside the '.cli' module.",
