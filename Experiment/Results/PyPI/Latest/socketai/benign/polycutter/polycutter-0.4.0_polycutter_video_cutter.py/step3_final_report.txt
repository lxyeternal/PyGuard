{
  "purpose": "The code implements a media processing utility for lossless segment extraction, keyframe detection, merging, validation, and manifest creation using ffmpeg and ffprobe.",
  "sources": "Reads input media file, probe data, and keyframe timestamps; no external network or secret inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed media segments, manifests, and logs; no data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Probes media properties -> detects keyframes -> snaps segments to keyframes -> extracts segments via ffmpeg -> optionally merges segments -> validates output -> writes manifest.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; subprocess calls are standard; no suspicious network or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured media processing tool that interfaces with ffmpeg/ffprobe for lossless segment handling. It includes multiple keyframe scanning methods, robust error handling, and detailed logging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. subprocess calls are standard for media tools, and no suspicious network activity or secret handling is evident. The scores assigned in the reports align with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate media processing utility with no malicious intent or sabotage signals. It employs standard practices and has a very low security risk profile.",
