  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Media processing with ffmpeg/ffprobe, no network or external data exfiltration.  \n- **Analysis:** Only media processing, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, signals of sabotage or backdoors absent.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, since it's a media utility, but some minimal inherent risk exists in subprocess calls)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar media processing, standard tools, no network activity.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard subprocess usage.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility, no malicious signals.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, as it's a media processing tool)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard media processing.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network, no obfuscation, uses well-known tools.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or sabotage.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.0 (very low, given no suspicious activity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Media processing, standard tools, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Analysis:** No backdoors, no obfuscation, no network activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility, safe in static analysis.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (minimal inherent risk in subprocess calls)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, media processing with ffmpeg/ffprobe, no suspicious signals.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no network activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe utility.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, typical for such tools)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, well-structured code with no signs of obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) is reasonable, considering subprocess calls and potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but overall very low.\n\n### My own estimates after careful review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear and maintainable.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risks in media processing tools, mainly related to subprocess handling and potential input validation issues, but nothing alarming.\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured media processing utility.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or sabotage signals are present.  \n- The low risk scores are justified given the context.",
