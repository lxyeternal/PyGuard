{
  "purpose": "This code implements a lossless video cutter and merger using ffprobe and ffmpeg, supporting precise segment snapping, validation, and manifest creation.",
  "sources": "Input video file path; segment specifications; ffprobe and ffmpeg executable paths; user configuration parameters; external utilities via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Output segment files; merged output file; JSON manifest file; temporary files for keyframe scans and intermediate segments.",
  "flows": "Input file is probed for metadata and keyframes; segments are validated and snapped to keyframes; ffmpeg extracts segments; segments are optionally merged; manifest is written; all cleanup and validation steps are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; subprocess calls use proper argument escaping; no network communication, system data exfiltration, or privilege escalation detected; code strictly performs media processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured and comprehensive implementation of a video processing utility with extensive logging, error handling, and validation. All subprocess calls use command lists with proper argument quoting, minimizing injection risk. The functions focus solely on media file analysis, extraction, merging, and manifest creation, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code maintains a clear separation of concerns, avoiding unsafe practices. Therefore, no malicious intent or security sabotage appears to be present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven media processing utility with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs intended operations securely, with proper error handling and input validation, and does not contain hidden or malicious code segments.",
