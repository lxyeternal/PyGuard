  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is solely for media processing—using ffmpeg and ffprobe for lossless segment extraction, keyframe detection, merging, validation, and manifest creation.\n   - No report indicates any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n   - The subprocess calls are standard, well-structured, and target common media tools with proper argument escaping.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Validity:**\n   - The code is comprehensive, covering media probing, keyframe scanning via multiple methods, segment snapping, extraction, merging, validation, and cleanup.\n   - Error handling is thorough, with custom exceptions for specific failure modes.\n   - The design aligns with best practices for media processing tasks, with detailed logging and validation steps.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are evident in the code or the described flow.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's purpose and the lack of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscation scores are zero, indicating code clarity and maintainability.\n   - Confidence levels are high (>0.9), consistent with the detailed, methodical analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Overreach:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's behavior and external interactions.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the code as a media utility with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent with the code's purpose and the analysis.\n   - No report suggests any reason to suspect hidden malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Code is clear, well-structured, and maintainable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low; the code performs standard media processing with no security concerns.\n\n### Additional Justification:\nGiven the detailed analysis, the absence of any suspicious activity, and the use of standard tools and practices, I conclude that the code is a legitimate media processing utility with no malicious or security-compromising features.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's behavior.",
