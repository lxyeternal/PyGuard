  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns such as eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, and insecure practices.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, input data, hardcoded credentials, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), obfuscated strings, data flows from inputs to outputs or network.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, network data) → dynamic execution or data processing functions → potential data leaks or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated strings, hardcoded IPs/credentials, lack of input validation, suspicious data flows, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic execution and obfuscation, which are suspicious indicators. The presence of hardcoded credentials and network communication further raises concern. The code structure suggests potential for malicious activity, especially if eval/exec are used with untrusted input. However, without concrete code snippets, the suspicion remains moderate. No direct malicious actions like data theft or system damage are confirmed. The overall security risk is moderate, with malware and obfuscation scores reflecting suspicion but lacking definitive proof.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious payloads, but no direct evidence of malicious actions is present. The suspicion warrants cautious handling, and further detailed code review is recommended if possible. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low to moderate.",
