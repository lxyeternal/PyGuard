  "security_risk": 0.5,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious payloads, but no direct evidence of malicious actions is present. The suspicion warrants cautious handling, and further detailed code review is recommended if possible. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low to moderate."
