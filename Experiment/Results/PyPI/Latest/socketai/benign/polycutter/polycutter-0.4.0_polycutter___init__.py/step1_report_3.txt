  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content; it appears to be an empty or placeholder file.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are identifiable as the code contains no executable content.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains no code, no comments, and no indications of unusual or malicious behavior. Its emptiness could suggest it is a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "Given the lack of code, there are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze. The absence of code also means there are no suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts. The file appears benign but also non-functional.",
