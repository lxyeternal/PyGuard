{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality for detecting scene changes and keyframes in videos using ffmpeg/ffprobe, enabling segment suggestions for video processing or editing.",
  "sources": "Reads input video file path, calls external ffmpeg/ffprobe commands, and reads their outputs.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to execute external commands; output parsing is internal and does not directly send untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> subprocess command execution -> parsing command output -> internal data structures and segment suggestions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or data leaks detected. Usage of subprocess with external commands is standard for media analysis; no risky or malicious commands are used.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on external tools (ffmpeg/ffprobe) to analyze video files for properties, scene changes, and keyframes. It performs media probing, parsing outputs, and making decisions based on detected data. No network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration is present. The subprocess calls are standard for media processing, with outputs parsed internally. The code does not include any code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic. It appears to be a legitimate media analysis utility without hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, transparent implementation of video scene and keyframe detection using ffmpeg/ffprobe. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected operations for media analysis without any suspicious actions or hidden functionalities.",
