  "purpose": "Media analysis of video files for scene changes, keyframes, and segment suggestions using ffmpeg/ffprobe.",
  "sources": "External subprocess calls to ffmpeg and ffprobe for media probing and detection.",
  "sinks": "Parsing of subprocess output; no data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Subprocess execution of ffmpeg/ffprobe → parsing stdout/stderr for media info and frame data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard usage of media analysis tools with straightforward parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs media property probing, scene change detection, keyframe detection, and segment suggestion through subprocess calls to trusted tools. It includes fallback mechanisms and standard parsing routines. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess commands are typical for media analysis, and no malicious activity or data exfiltration is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent media analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It relies on standard tools and practices, and the security risk is minimal. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and standard nature.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
