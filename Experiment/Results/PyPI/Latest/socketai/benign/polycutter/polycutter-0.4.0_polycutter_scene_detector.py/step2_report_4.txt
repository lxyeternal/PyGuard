  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code performs standard media analysis functions—using ffmpeg/ffprobe for scene detection, keyframe extraction, and media property probing.\n   - No report mentions any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code relies on external tools and internal parsing, which is typical for such utilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that subprocess commands are standard and that no secret keys or backdoors are present.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with their conclusions.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), consistent with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9–1), reflecting the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n   - The highest risk score is 0.2, justified by the use of subprocess calls to external tools, which is standard but could theoretically be exploited if external tools are compromised—though this is outside the code's scope.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent or activity.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, standard subprocess usage, and typical media analysis workflows.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - The low malware and security risk scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0.1** (due to external subprocess reliance, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard media analysis utility that leverages well-known tools (ffmpeg/ffprobe). It performs expected functions without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of subprocess calls is typical and does not introduce significant risk, especially given the absence of network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears safe, transparent, and free of malware or sabotage indicators. The provided reports are accurate and align with this assessment.",
