{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to analyze video files to detect scene changes and keyframes for use in video segmentation, using ffmpeg and ffprobe tools.",
  "sources": "File input via input_path; subprocess calls to external ffmpeg/ffprobe commands for media analysis and scene/keyframe detection.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted input data; subprocess outputs are parsed internally without data leaks; no network communication or sensitive data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input file path read by subprocess commands; ffprobe/ffmpeg produce output parsed to identify scene change points and keyframes; data flows from external tools to internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed; code uses standard media analysis tools without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys; logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard subprocess calls to ffmpeg and ffprobe for media probing and scene/keyframe detection, parsing their output for relevant data. No code injections, network transmissions, or data leaks are evident. The code maintains clear structure, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It strictly performs media analysis tasks without executing or executing untrusted data beyond calling external processes. The external commands are typical for media processing and do not contain malicious payloads. The only concern could be if the external tools are compromised, but within the code scope, it does not include such malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of media analysis using ffmpeg/ffprobe with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected operations securely without suspicious or malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or security risks detected.",
