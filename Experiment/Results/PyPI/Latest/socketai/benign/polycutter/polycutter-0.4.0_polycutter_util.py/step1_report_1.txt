{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting byte counts to human-readable strings, parsing timestamp strings into seconds, and formatting seconds into time strings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments: 'n_bytes' (integer), 'ts_str' (string), and 'seconds' (float). No external input sources are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs are string returns from functions, with no external system interaction, network activity, or file writing present. No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input (parameters) -> processing (parsing/formatting) -> output (formatted strings or floats). No external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks such as network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard Python libraries and straightforward logic. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names or constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three utility functions: 'humanize_bytes', 'parse_timestamp', and 'format_time'. Each performs standard conversions and formatting, with proper error handling and no external interactions. Functions handle input validation, convert data types appropriately, and format output strings for readability. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, file access, or secret leaks, are present. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for data formatting and parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use as part of a larger project.",
