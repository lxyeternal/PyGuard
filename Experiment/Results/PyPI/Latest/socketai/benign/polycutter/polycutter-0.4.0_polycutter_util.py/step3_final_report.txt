  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting byte counts to human-readable strings, parsing timestamp strings into seconds, and formatting seconds into time strings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: n_bytes (int), ts_str (str), seconds (float)",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed locally within functions",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through parsing and formatting logic; no external data flow or system interaction",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three straightforward utility functions: 'humanize_bytes' converts byte counts to human-readable strings with binary prefixes; 'parse_timestamp' interprets various timestamp formats into total seconds; 'format_time' formats seconds into human-readable time strings. All functions use standard Python libraries and handle invalid inputs gracefully. No external system interactions, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured, with appropriate error handling and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard data formatting and parsing tasks, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
