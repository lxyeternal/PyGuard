{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable byte size formatting, timestamp parsing, and time formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: n_bytes (int), ts_str (str), seconds (float).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involve untrusted data affecting system security; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations and formatting functions, with no external data or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions for data formatting and parsing, all using standard Python libraries (fractions, decimal). The functions perform input validation, parsing, and formatting without any external or system-altering actions. No external data, network operations, or potentially malicious activities are present. The code relies solely on input parameters and local computations. The functions are straightforward and do not contain any unusual code or obfuscated patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for formatting bytes and timestamps, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and intended for legitimate formatting tasks.",
