{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting byte sizes to human-readable formats, parsing timestamp strings into seconds, and formatting seconds into human-readable time strings.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: n_bytes (integer), ts_str (string), and seconds (float).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involve untrusted data leading to data leaks, code execution, or system modifications. No outputs are directed to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed internally without external data flows; no data is sent or received over network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard data manipulation and formatting tasks. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. Error handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The functions handle data parsing and formatting using standard Python features. No external or potentially malicious libraries are used beyond standard library imports. The parsing and formatting logic is typical and does not involve executing or evaluating untrusted code. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or code injection, are evident. The functions do not invoke network operations, system calls, or insecure functions. Overall, the code appears to be utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard utility functions for data size and time formatting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
