  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling byte size conversion, timestamp parsing, and time formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: n_bytes (integer), ts_str (string), seconds (float). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through calculations and formatting functions; no external sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Functions perform standard conversions and formatting without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions: 'humanize_bytes' converts byte counts into human-readable strings; 'parse_timestamp' interprets time strings into seconds; 'format_time' formats seconds into readable time strings. All functions rely on standard library modules (fractions, decimal) for calculations and formatting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data manipulation is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or hidden backdoors. The code appears benign and standard for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for data and time formatting. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
