  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable byte size formatting, timestamp parsing, and time formatting.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: n_bytes, ts_str, seconds.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no external sinks or outputs are directly used for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed and converted into numerical formats, then formatted into strings for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data parsing and formatting operations: converting byte counts to human-readable strings, parsing timestamp strings into seconds, and formatting seconds into time strings. All functions handle data securely without using untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. No external network activity, cryptographic operations, or environment variable manipulations are present. The functions use safe standard library methods and proper error handling for invalid input. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It securely handles input data for formatting and parsing tasks without external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
