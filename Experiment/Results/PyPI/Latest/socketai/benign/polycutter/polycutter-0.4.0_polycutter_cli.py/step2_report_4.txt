  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, subprocess usage, file operations, and overall behavior.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI for lossless media cutting and probing, using ffmpeg/ffprobe, with safe file handling, user prompts, and no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that subprocess calls are standard and parameterized, with no suspicious command modifications. File operations involve reading, writing, and deleting files with user confirmation or force flags, which is typical. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden code.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** The malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The code is transparent, and no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard subprocess calls, safe file handling, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior. External commands are executed with validated arguments, no suspicious code patterns, and no signs of data leakage.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, high confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on media analysis and lossless cutting, with safe subprocess use, user prompts, and no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code uses subprocess for ffprobe/ffmpeg, handles files carefully, and prompts before destructive actions. No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Describes a CLI for media segment processing, with subprocess calls, file operations, and user prompts.\n- **Assessment:** The code executes external tools securely, with validation and prompts. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Score is 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with safe subprocess invocation, input validation, and no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code's external calls are parameterized, with no suspicious patterns. No backdoors or malware indicators.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code primarily interacts with external tools (ffmpeg/ffprobe), handles files carefully, prompts users before destructive actions, and contains no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:** Given the comprehensive analysis, I agree with the provided scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n  - **Risk:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, since the code performs expected media processing tasks and handles files safely.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, typical for CLI media tools)\n\n**In summary, the code appears to be a legitimate, safe open-source media processing CLI with no malicious indicators.**",
