  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, subprocess usage, file operations, and overall behavior.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a CLI utility for media processing, leveraging ffmpeg and ffprobe via subprocess calls.\n- Segment parsing, output validation, and reporting are handled with standard, safe practices.\n- User prompts are used before destructive actions, with options for force overwrite.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are evident.\n- Subprocess commands are constructed with validated parameters, reducing injection risks.\n- File operations (read/write/delete) are performed with proper error handling.\n- External tools are trusted and standard for media processing; no malicious commands or suspicious modifications are detected.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate media CLI with segment parsing, validation, and detailed reporting.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, subprocess calls are standard. The low security risk accounts for the potential misuse if external tools are compromised, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Media analysis ('probe') and lossless cutting ('cut') with JSON output.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; subprocesses are used correctly, and external tools are standard. The risk is minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar media processing with segment parsing, ffprobe analysis, and reporting.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns; standard subprocess usage, no obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for lossless media cutting and probing.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; subprocess calls are safe; user prompts are typical.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Media file cutting and probing.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; external commands are standard; no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior. External subprocess calls are standard, with no suspicious command modifications.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0; the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in some reports, mainly due to the potential misuse if external tools are compromised or if user inputs are maliciously crafted. However, the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly related to external dependencies and user inputs, not code behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source CLI media processing tool with no indicators of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects standard external command execution and file handling practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
