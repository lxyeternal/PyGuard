  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided summaries to identify any discrepancies, logical flaws, or potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI tool for lossless media cutting and probing, using ffmpeg/ffprobe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** The report correctly notes subprocess calls to ffmpeg/ffprobe, safe file operations, and user prompts. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on media analysis via ffprobe, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** The subprocess calls are standard, with proper error handling. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious indicators. Security risk is low (0.2).\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a CLI for lossless media cutting and probing, with standard subprocess and file operations.\n- **Findings:** User prompts for overwriting files, subprocess calls to ffmpeg/ffprobe, and filesystem interactions are typical and safe.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 fits; no malicious code or obfuscation. Security risk remains low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** CLI tool for media analysis and lossless cutting, with subprocess calls, file I/O, and user prompts.\n- **Findings:** The code uses standard practices, with no obfuscation or hidden malicious activity. External commands are invoked with validated parameters.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected. Security risk is low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on media processing, with safe subprocess use and validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. External tools are used properly, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis; security risk is minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate CLI media processing tool.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n- Subprocess calls to ffmpeg/ffprobe are standard, with proper validation.\n- File operations are typical, with user prompts and safe handling.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the standard use of external tools and safe file operations.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, open-source CLI media processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The provided scores are appropriate and justified based on the detailed review.",
