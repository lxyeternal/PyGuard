{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface tool for lossless media cutting and probing, with functions for segment parsing, output validation, and media analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths, segment specifications (from strings or files), output patterns, and configuration options; reads and writes JSON files; uses subprocess to run ffprobe commands.",
  "sinks": "Executes ffprobe and ffmpeg commands via subprocess; writes JSON output files; interacts with filesystem for reading/writing/deleting files and directories; prompts user for confirmations.",
  "flows": "User inputs (paths, patterns, configs) flow into validation and parsing functions; subprocess outputs (probe data, keyframes) are processed and displayed; file system changes occur during cleanup/removal; output files are created or overwritten based on user confirmation and validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; subprocess calls are standard but could be misused if ffprobe or ffmpeg paths are compromised; user prompts are used but are typical for CLI tools; no hidden backdoors or malicious data leakage mechanisms are evident; the code relies on external tools for media analysis but does not internally perform untrusted code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility for media processing, with functions for segment parsing, validation, user prompts, and subprocess invocation of ffprobe/ffmpeg. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. External subprocess calls are used for media analysis and processing, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscated code are present. User prompts for overwrite/delete actions are expected behavior, not malicious. The use of standard libraries and typical media processing patterns indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI media processing tool designed for lossless cutting and probing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses external tools for media analysis and performs filesystem operations safely, with user prompts and validations. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
