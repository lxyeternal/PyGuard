  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the correctness of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:** The code is a CLI media processing tool, with subprocess calls to ffmpeg/ffprobe, file operations, and user prompts. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies that subprocess commands are standard and no suspicious modifications are present.  \n- File handling is normal, with prompts for overwriting, which is standard for CLI tools.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The confidence score (0.95) seems appropriate given the thorough review.  \n- Malware score (0) is justified.  \n- Security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, considering potential user error or misconfiguration but no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on media analysis via ffprobe, no malicious behavior, external commands are standard, no obfuscation or secrets.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly notes subprocess calls are standard and parameterized.  \n- No malicious code or backdoors.  \n- No obfuscation or secret data.  \n- Confidence (0.9) is appropriate.  \n- Malware (0) and security risk (0.2) are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:** The code is a CLI for lossless media cutting and probing, with subprocess calls, filesystem interactions, and user prompts. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Recognizes that subprocess calls are typical and parameters are validated.  \n- No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.  \n- User prompts are standard.  \n- Confidence (0.9), malware (0), security risk (0.1) are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate CLI for media segment cutting and probing, with subprocess calls, filesystem operations, and user prompts. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly identifies that subprocess calls are standard and properly encapsulated.  \n- No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- External tools are used as intended.  \n- Confidence (0.9), malware (0), security risk (0.1) are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:** The code is a CLI for media processing, with subprocess calls, file handling, and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Recognizes that subprocess calls are safely encapsulated and parameters are validated.  \n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.  \n- Confidence (0.95), malware (0), security risk (0.1) are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate CLI media processing tool. They correctly identify that subprocess calls are standard and parameterized, filesystem operations are typical, and no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores (Consensus):**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to user error or misconfiguration potential, not malicious intent)\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports, considering the potential for user misconfiguration or accidental misuse, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and intended for legitimate media processing purposes. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity has been found.",
