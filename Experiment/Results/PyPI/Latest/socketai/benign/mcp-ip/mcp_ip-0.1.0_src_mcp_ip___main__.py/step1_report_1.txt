{
  "purpose": "The code imports the main function from the mcp_ip module and executes it.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly; it imports a function which may internally read data.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the main() function from an external module, which could potentially perform any actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import then execute main(), with no data passing explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is very simple, but the behavior depends entirely on the imported main() function.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports a single function from mcp_ip and runs it. Without inspecting the implementation of mcp_ip.main, it is impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The code itself is minimal and does not contain obvious malicious indicators, but the potential for malicious activity depends on the imported function's internal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and mainly acts as a trigger to run mcp_ip.main. No malicious behavior is evident at this level, but the overall security depends entirely on the imported module's implementation. Without further information, the risk cannot be fully assessed.",
