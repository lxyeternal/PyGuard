  "flows": "Import mcp_ip.main -> main() execution",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no inline secrets, no obfuscated code, no apparent malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'main' from the 'mcp_ip' module and executes it immediately. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious operations visible. The behavior entirely depends on the contents of 'mcp_ip'. Without inspecting 'mcp_ip', there is no way to determine if the invoked 'main' contains malicious code. The code itself is straightforward and typical for a script that delegates execution to another module.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's safety depends on the implementation of 'mcp_ip.main'. As provided, it appears to be a simple entry point that calls another module's main function.",
