{
  "purpose": "Minimal script that imports and executes 'main' from 'mcp_ip' module, acting as an entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from mcp_ip import main' and the call to 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which may execute external code; potential for malicious behavior depends on 'mcp_ip.main'.",
  "flows": "Import 'main' from 'mcp_ip' -> call 'main()' -> execution of external code within 'mcp_ip.main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple entry point that delegates execution to 'mcp_ip.main'. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'mcp_ip.main', which is not provided. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the minimal code and external dependency. The confidence level is moderate due to lack of internal inspection of 'mcp_ip'. The overall risk is low but warrants caution if 'mcp_ip' is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and acts as a launcher for an external module. The security risk hinges on 'mcp_ip.main', which cannot be assessed here. The current scores are reasonable; no modifications are necessary.",
