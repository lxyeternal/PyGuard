  "purpose": "Provides an API endpoint to retrieve the client's public IP address.",
  "sources": "Request headers ('x-forwarded-for') and request.client.host",
  "sinks": "Logging the client IP with print, returning the IP as a response",
  "flows": "Request headers -> server logic -> print/log -> response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Uses standard FastAPI middleware and request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple FastAPI app with an endpoint that extracts the client's IP address, considering proxy headers. It logs and returns this IP. No external data is fetched or sent, and there are no obfuscated parts, malicious network calls, or data leaks. The code follows common practices for IP retrieval and logging. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an IP retrieval API without any malicious or maliciously intended features. It performs expected operations securely, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
