  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard IP retrieval API with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security concern is the permissive CORS policy, which can be tightened but does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). No adjustments are necessary."
