  "purpose": "Provide an API endpoint to retrieve the client's public IP address.",
  "sources": "Request headers (x-forwarded-for) and request.client.host",
  "sinks": "Returning the client IP address; printing to logs",
  "flows": "Request headers -> server-side extraction of IP -> response with IP, logs the IP",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external requests or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a FastAPI application with CORS middleware allowing all origins. The endpoint /get_log_client_ip extracts the client's IP address from headers or request object and returns it, while logging it. There are no external network calls, no data exfiltration, no code injections, or malicious logic present. The use of request.headers.get for x-forwarded-for is standard for retrieving client IPs behind proxies. The print statement is benign and used for logging. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward IP retrieval API with standard practices and no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
