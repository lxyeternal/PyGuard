  "purpose": "Provide an API endpoint to retrieve the client's public IP address from a request",
  "sources": "Request headers (x-forwarded-for), request.client.host",
  "sinks": "Logging via print statement, returning IP address as response",
  "flows": "Request headers -> IP extraction -> Logging/returning IP",
  "anomalies": "Usage of print for logging instead of a secure logging mechanism; allowing all origins without restriction; no validation or sanitization of headers",
  "analysis": "The code defines a FastAPI application that exposes an endpoint to retrieve the client's IP address, considering reverse proxy headers. It allows all CORS origins, which can be insecure but is not malicious by itself. The code accesses request headers to get 'x-forwarded-for' and falls back to the direct client IP, then logs it with print. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or data leakage mechanisms. The use of print for logging is not secure but not malicious. The code does not perform any unsafe operations, nor does it include hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving a simple IP retrieval function with no malicious intent. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected. The primary concern is the permissive CORS policy, which could be a security risk in production, but not malicious code.",
