{
  "purpose": "To run a time and timezone conversion server using uvicorn and FastAPI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--local-timezone), imports app from server module, and calls uvicorn.run() with the app.",
  "sinks": "uvicorn.run() executes the web server, which can handle incoming HTTP requests. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--local-timezone' is read but not used further; the 'app' is passed directly to uvicorn, which handles HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an untranslated print statement ('-----加载-----') that may be for debugging; no use of the '--local-timezone' argument beyond parsing, indicating incomplete handling.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes a web server for time-related queries, with command-line argument parsing that does not influence server behavior. No code injections, data leaks, or suspicious network activity are present. The print statement appears to be a leftover debugging or logging message. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected. The code structure is straightforward and standard for launching a web server.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign server launcher script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is an unused argument and a debug print statement, which are not malicious.",
