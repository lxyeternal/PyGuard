{
  "purpose": "To run a time and timezone conversion server for MCP using a FastAPI/ASGI app.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments, specifically '--local-timezone', and imports the 'app' object from the 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'uvicorn.run(app)' function launches the server; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--local-timezone' is read but not utilized within this code; the 'app' is served via uvicorn without additional data flow processing.",
  "anomalies": "The '--local-timezone' argument is defined but not used anywhere in the code; the print statement is in Chinese ('-----加载-----'), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an application object and runs it using uvicorn, which is typical for serving ASGI apps. The command-line argument for local timezone is declared but not used, indicating incomplete or placeholder functionality. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is present. The print statement's language is unusual but not harmful. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward server launcher with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server startup script with an unused command-line argument. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
