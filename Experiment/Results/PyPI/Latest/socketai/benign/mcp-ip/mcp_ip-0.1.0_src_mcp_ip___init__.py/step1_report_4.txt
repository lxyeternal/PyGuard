{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and runs a FastAPI/Starlette application for MCP time and timezone conversion functionalities, serving via uvicorn.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--local-timezone), imports 'app' from the local server module.",
  "sinks": "Uses uvicorn.run(app) to start the server, which could expose the application to external access, but does not directly handle untrusted input data within this script.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed but only the --local-timezone option is read; however, it is not used further in the code. The app is launched via uvicorn, which could handle external requests, but within this script, no data is directly processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a print statement with Chinese characters ('-----加载-----') is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. The '--local-timezone' argument is defined but not used, which may indicate incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a launcher for a server application imported from a local module. It parses a command-line argument that is not utilized further, which could suggest incomplete feature implementation but no malicious behavior. The server is run with uvicorn, which is standard for serving ASGI applications. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious network activity is evident. The overall design is typical for a Python web server startup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward server launcher for a time and timezone conversion service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The unused command-line argument suggests incomplete development but does not impact security.",
