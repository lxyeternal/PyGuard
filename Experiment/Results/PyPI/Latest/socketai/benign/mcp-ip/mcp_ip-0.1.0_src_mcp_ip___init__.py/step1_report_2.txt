{
  "purpose": "Provide a server application for handling time queries and timezone conversions for MCP",
  "sources": "User input through command-line arguments (--local-timezone), imported modules (argparse, uvicorn)",
  "sinks": "uvicorn.run(app) - potentially exposing the app server to external requests",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed but not directly used in the code; the app is started via uvicorn, exposing the server",
  "anomalies": "The print statement '-----加载-----' (Chinese for 'loading') is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the app object from a local module and runs it with uvicorn, a standard ASGI server. It accepts a command-line argument '--local-timezone' which is not used further, possibly for future extension. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The print statement is non-standard but benign. The overall structure appears typical for a web server launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward server startup script for a timezone conversion service. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present based on this code alone.",
