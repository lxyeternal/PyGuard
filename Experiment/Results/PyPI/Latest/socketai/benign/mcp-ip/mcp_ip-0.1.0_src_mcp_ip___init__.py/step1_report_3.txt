{
  "purpose": "Provide a server application for MCP time and timezone conversions using uvicorn and FastAPI or similar framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from .server module; command-line argument parsing for local timezone override",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; uvicorn.run(app) executes the server",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed and potentially used for timezone override (though not implemented); server runs with app",
  "anomalies": "The '--local-timezone' argument is parsed but not used within the code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns; the print statement in Chinese is unusual but harmless",
  "analysis": "The code imports an application instance from a local module, defines a main function that sets up command-line parsing, and runs the server using uvicorn. The '--local-timezone' argument suggests intent to allow timezone override, but the code does not apply this argument. There are no suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activities. The print statement '-----加载-----' is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to be part of a benign server application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple server launcher for MCP time and timezone conversions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The unused argument suggests incomplete implementation but does not introduce security issues.",
