  "purpose": "The code provides a function to translate text into a specified language using an external API.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: user_id, api_key, text, target_language; reads response data from the API response.",
  "sinks": "Returns the translated text from the API response; makes a POST request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "User inputs (user_id, api_key, text, target_language) are sent via HTTP POST to the external translation service, then the response is processed to extract the 'result' field.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; API endpoint URL appears legitimate; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for 'text', constructs a JSON payload including sensitive data (user_id, api_key), and sends this data to an external server. The use of requests.Session and response handling appears standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The API URL is explicit and does not connect to suspicious domains. The data is only sent to a known URL, and response data is returned as-is. There are no indicators of hidden backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or unsafe code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an API client for translation purposes. It handles input validation and makes a secure HTTP request. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
