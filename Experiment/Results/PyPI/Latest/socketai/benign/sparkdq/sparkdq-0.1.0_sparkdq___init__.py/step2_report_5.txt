  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external library calls, or control flows.\n   - The code is a standard practice in Python packaging for version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No evidence of data leakage, network activity, or hidden payloads.\n   - The code is benign and typical for its purpose.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are consistent; no errors or flaws are identified.\n   - The code is straightforward and correct for its intended purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims**:\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and poses no security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable based on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no need to assign higher risk scores.\n- If future code snippets include dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation, reassessment would be necessary.\n\n**Summary**: The current scores are appropriate; no changes needed. The code is safe and standard for version declaration.",
