  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment with no input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No functions, imports, I/O, or dynamic behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
