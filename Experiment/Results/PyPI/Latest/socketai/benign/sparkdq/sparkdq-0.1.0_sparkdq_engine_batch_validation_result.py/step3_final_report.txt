{
  "purpose": "Encapsulates the results of a batch data quality validation run, including filtered DataFrames for passing, failing, and warning rows, as well as summary statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads internal validation columns such as '_dq_passed', '_dq_errors', '_dq_aggregate_errors' within the DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "Filters DataFrames based on validation metadata; no external data transfer or system calls occur.",
  "flows": "Source columns (_dq_passed, _dq_errors, etc.) are used to filter and generate different DataFrames for pass, fail, and warning cases; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data class managing validation results for Spark DataFrames. It filters data based on internal validation columns, generates summaries, and adds timestamp metadata for auditing. No malicious patterns, external calls, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, relying on explicit validation metadata, and uses standard Spark functions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, which is part of a validation framework. No issues or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured validation result handler with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe component with minimal security concern.",
