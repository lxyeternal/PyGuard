  "purpose": "Engine for executing data quality checks on Spark DataFrames in batch mode, applying checks and annotating results.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame columns, external check set via self.check_set",
  "sinks": "Return of BatchValidationResult containing validated DataFrame and check results",
  "flows": "DataFrame flows into runner.run() with check set, results flow back into BatchValidationResult",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation on Spark DataFrames, verifying check set presence, executing checks via BatchCheckRunner, and returning results. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. External dependencies are typical for such validation engines. The code does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. External components are assumed trustworthy; no signs of malware or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward Spark data validation engine with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
