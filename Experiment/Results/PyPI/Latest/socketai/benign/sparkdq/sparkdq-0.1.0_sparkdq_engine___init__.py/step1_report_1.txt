{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports specific classes from submodules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package: .batch.dq_engine and .batch.validation_result",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. The import statements are standard Python relative imports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export file with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply re-exports classes from internal modules for external use.",
