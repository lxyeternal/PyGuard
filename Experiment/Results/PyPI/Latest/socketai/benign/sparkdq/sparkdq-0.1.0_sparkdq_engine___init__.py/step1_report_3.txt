  "purpose": "Module exporting classes BatchDQEngine and BatchValidationResult for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local package modules (.batch.dq_engine and .batch.validation_result).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data processing occurring in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports do not process untrusted data; only module references are established.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. Import statements are standard for modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify public API. There is no data processing, network activity, or code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The module simply exposes two classes for external use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions solely to expose classes from other modules.",
