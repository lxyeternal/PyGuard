{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a package, specifically exposing classes BatchDQEngine and BatchValidationResult.",
  "sources": "No input sources; imports are from relative modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only imports and exports class names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It does not perform any data processing, external calls, or contain obfuscated or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. The simplicity indicates this is a module initializer, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer setting public API exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate.",
