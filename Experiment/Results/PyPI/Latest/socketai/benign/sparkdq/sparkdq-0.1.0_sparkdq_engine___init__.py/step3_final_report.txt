  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module, likely an __init__.py, importing two classes and defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or untrusted input is present. The code is static, simple, and standard for package initialization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any security flaws. The assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
