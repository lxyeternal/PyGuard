  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for data quality validation engines, managing checks and severity levels.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, typing) and from sparkdq modules; no external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data outputs, external communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data processing or untrusted data flows are present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected. The code appears to be a standard class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a base class with methods to initialize the engine and retrieve checks from a CheckSet. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. It mainly manages internal state and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious class definition for data quality validation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
