  "purpose": "Abstract base class for data quality validation engines, managing check registration and retrieval.",
  "sources": "check_set parameter, internal class attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or output flows",
  "flows": "From check_set to get_all() method internally",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, standard abstract class with an initializer accepting optional check set and severity levels, and a method to retrieve checks. No external data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. All imported modules are standard for such a framework. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract base class for data quality validation engines. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
