{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data quality validation engines, managing checks and severity levels.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; methods are simple getters and initializers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for data quality engines, with no external data input, no code execution based on untrusted input, and no suspicious logic. It imports standard libraries and other modules, but does not perform any data processing or network activity. The class constructor and get_checks method are simple and do not execute or evaluate untrusted data. Overall, this code appears to be standard boilerplate for a data quality framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent. It simply defines an abstract class for managing checks in a data quality system. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
