{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for data quality validation engines, managing check registration and retrieval.",
  "sources": "The class reads from optional 'check_set' parameter and internal 'fail_levels' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no external data output or network interactions.",
  "flows": "The method get_checks() retrieves checks from 'check_set' if available, but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of optional parameters appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward abstract base for data quality engines, managing a set of checks and severity levels. The constructor initializes optional check set and severity levels. The get_checks() method safely retrieves all checks if a check set is provided. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The code is well-structured and typical for such design patterns, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a standard foundation for data quality validation engines without any malicious intent or security risks.",
