  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for data quality check configuration and runtime errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists entirely of class and method definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points involving untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this is purely error class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. All code appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exceptions related to data quality checks, such as runtime configuration errors, missing columns, invalid configurations, and severity level issues. All classes inherit from built-in Exception types or other custom exceptions, with constructors providing descriptive error messages. There is no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network activity. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose and no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a data quality framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is well-structured, transparent, and safe.",
