  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of custom exception classes for a data quality framework.\n- No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- Exception messages are informative and formatted for debugging.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and serves error handling purposes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code being purely exception class definitions.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate given the clear, readable class structures.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- The **risk scores** are all 0 or very close to it, which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The **malware scores** are 0, matching the absence of malicious activity.\n- The **confidence** scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the analysis is correct.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough, with no indications of hidden issues.\n- The code is standard for exception handling, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The detailed descriptions confirm that the code is safe and intended solely for error reporting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the assigned scores.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since the code is purely for error handling and does not introduce security risks)\n\n**Final note:** The thoroughness of the reports and their consistency give high confidence that the code is safe. No further action is needed.",
