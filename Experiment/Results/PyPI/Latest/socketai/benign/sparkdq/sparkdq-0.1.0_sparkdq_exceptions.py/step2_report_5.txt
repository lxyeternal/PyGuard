  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no dynamic, external, or malicious behavior. The code is static, straightforward, and designed for error handling in a data validation framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no signs of data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is solely exception class definitions with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious payloads, a high risk score is unwarranted. The scores of 0 or 0.5 (if used) are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's purpose and limitations. They do not speculate beyond the evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. The high confidence (1.0) reflects the certainty that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** (or possibly 0.1 if the framework assigns minimal baseline risk to any code, but 0 is more accurate here)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a set of well-structured, non-malicious exception class definitions for a data validation framework. No dynamic, external, or malicious behaviors are present. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:  \n**Malware Score**: 0  \n**Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n**Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
