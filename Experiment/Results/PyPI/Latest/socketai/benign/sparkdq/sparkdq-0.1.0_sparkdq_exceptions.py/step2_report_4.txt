  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with descriptive messages and standard inheritance.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1.0), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or external interactions.\n- Exception messages are informative but do not reveal secrets or sensitive data.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling within a larger framework.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Any discrepancies or overestimations?**\n- No. The scores align with the analysis. The detailed reasoning supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**\n- Given the nature of the code, no. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in a data validation framework.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
