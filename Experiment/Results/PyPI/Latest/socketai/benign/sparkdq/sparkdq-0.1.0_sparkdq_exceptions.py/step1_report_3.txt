  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various configuration errors in data quality checks.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and __init__ methods where error messages are constructed.",
  "sinks": "Error messages outputted when exceptions are raised, typically for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation during error conditions leading to error message construction and raising.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes to handle specific configuration and runtime errors related to data quality checks. All classes inherit from built-in Exception types or custom base errors. __init__ methods set informative error messages. No use of untrusted input data or external data sources is present; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to serve as part of a larger framework for error handling and does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions intended for handling configuration errors in a data quality framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
