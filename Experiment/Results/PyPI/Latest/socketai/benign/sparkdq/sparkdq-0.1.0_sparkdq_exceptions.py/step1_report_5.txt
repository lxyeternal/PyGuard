  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for data quality check configuration and runtime errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, exception initializers, string formatting for error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings, exception raising points, string formatting for debugging info.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes -> raising exceptions with messages -> potential error handling by callers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. All classes are standard exception subclasses with message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for a data quality framework. These classes are used for indicating configuration errors or runtime issues, with no evidence of external data input, data leakage, network communication, or malicious logic. The constructors format error messages to include relevant context, which is typical for debugging and logging. There are no suspicious operations, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The overall structure and content indicate that this is standard, well-structured exception handling code intended for error reporting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, comprising standard exception class definitions for error handling in a data quality framework. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It is purely structural for managing configuration and runtime errors.",
