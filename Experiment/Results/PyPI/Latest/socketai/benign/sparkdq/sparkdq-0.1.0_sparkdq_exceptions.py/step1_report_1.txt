  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for data quality check configuration and runtime errors in a data validation framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class and method definitions with exception messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, input/output, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Exception initializations occur at points of invalid configuration or runtime misconfiguration, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior. The code is standard exception class definitions with no dynamic or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a data quality framework. It includes informative docstrings, constructors setting descriptive messages, and no external or untrusted data processing. No signs of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as part of a larger, non-malicious framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions for configuration and runtime errors in a data validation system. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is standard practice for such error handling modules.",
