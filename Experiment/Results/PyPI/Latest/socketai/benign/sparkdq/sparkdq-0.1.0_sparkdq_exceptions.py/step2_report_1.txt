  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of custom exception classes used for configuration and runtime error handling in a data quality framework.\n- No external data sources, data flows, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that these are exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws:**  \n  None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with constructors providing informative messages, and no errors are evident.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  Also correctly scored as 0 across reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  Correctly scored as 0; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports give a confidence of 1 and a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any external input handling, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n- No malicious intent or malware is evident.\n- The exception messages are standard and serve debugging purposes.\n\n### Additional Challenges:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code content.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a data validation framework. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
