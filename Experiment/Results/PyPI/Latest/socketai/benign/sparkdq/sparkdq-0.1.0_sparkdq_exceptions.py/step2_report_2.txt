  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the validity of the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, constructors, and descriptive docstrings.\n- No data processing, external input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a larger data validation framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is safe, standard exception classes with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found. The reasoning is sound.\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1; code is standard, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No discrepancies.\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; exception classes are straightforward, safe, and serve error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.5 or lower, which is reasonable because these are error class definitions with no active security risk.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The current risk scores are all at 0.5 or below, which is appropriate given the context. Since there's no malicious activity or security vulnerability, maintaining a low risk score is justified.\n- If a more conservative approach is desired, the risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, emphasizing the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Conclusion**\n\n- The code is entirely safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores (My opinion):**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard exception classes)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, only error handling code)\n\n**This aligns with the detailed reasoning above.**",
