{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for configuration and runtime errors in a data quality framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor methods within the code, primarily during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data sources; exception messages are constructed from internal parameters.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with message formatting; no data flow involving external or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and constructors that generate informative messages. There are no external data inputs, dynamic code execution, or network interactions. The exception messages are static or based on parameters, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The structure is standard, and the purpose is clear: error handling within a data validation framework. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes used for configuration and runtime error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
