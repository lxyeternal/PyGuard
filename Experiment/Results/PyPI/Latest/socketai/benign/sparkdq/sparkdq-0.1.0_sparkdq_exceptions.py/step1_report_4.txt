  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for data quality check configuration and runtime errors.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, constructors, and string messages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; exception messages are standard and do not handle external input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exceptions are used for error signaling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, primarily for data quality checks and configuration validation. The classes include informative docstrings and constructors that format error messages. There is no user input handling, external data processing, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception definitions intended for use in a larger data validation framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling in a data quality validation framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and focused solely on structured error reporting.",
