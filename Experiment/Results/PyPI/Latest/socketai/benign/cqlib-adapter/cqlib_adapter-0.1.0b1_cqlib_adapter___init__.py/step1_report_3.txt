{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata and licensing header for a Python package, specifically part of 'cqlib'. It is likely used for versioning and license compliance.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module ._version to retrieve __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static import statement",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; license comments are standard",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a license header, copyright notice, and a single import statement for a version identifier. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data processing. The import from a relative module suggests internal version management, typical for package metadata. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license and version import header with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as package metadata and does not perform any harmful actions.",
