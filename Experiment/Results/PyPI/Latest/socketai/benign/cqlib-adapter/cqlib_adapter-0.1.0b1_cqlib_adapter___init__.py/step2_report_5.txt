  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a minimal import statement for a version string from a local module, accompanied by licensing comments.\n- No external data handling, user input, or network communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is standard for package version management.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code snippet is syntactically correct.\n   - It does not perform any malicious or risky operations.\n   - The import is straightforward and typical for such use cases.\n   - No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, standard code with no malicious or risky behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately assess the code as benign.\n   - No challenges needed here.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the existing scores. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard version import with licensing comments.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
