{
  "purpose": "The code imports the version information from a local module, likely used for version tracking within the package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: from ._version import __version__",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs a static import of a module attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The comment about copyright and license is standard documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and licensing comments. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, or code execution beyond importing a version string. The import appears to be for internal version management, common in Python packages. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import version information. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
