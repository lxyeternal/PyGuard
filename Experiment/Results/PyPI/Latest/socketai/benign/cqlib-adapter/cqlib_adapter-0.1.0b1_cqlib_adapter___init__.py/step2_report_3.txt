  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a minimal import statement for a version string from a local module, accompanied by licensing comments.\n- No data flows, external input/output, or runtime behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard package metadata management.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   The code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, data flows, or anomalies. No issues are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign, standard version import with licensing comments. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - **SecurityRisk:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**  \n   Since the code is purely for version management and licensing, the risk score of 0 is justified. No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are suggested or implied.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version import statement with licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
