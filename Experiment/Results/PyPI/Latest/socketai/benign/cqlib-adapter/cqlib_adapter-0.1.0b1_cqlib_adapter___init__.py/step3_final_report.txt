  "purpose": "Import the __version__ attribute from a local module to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading the local module ._version for __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statement reads local module; no data flow to external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with licensing comments, typical for version management in Python packages. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package version import with licensing comments. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
