  "purpose": "To enforce Python version compatibility and read the version number from a file for the cqlib library.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of 'VERSION.txt' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads the version string from 'VERSION.txt' and assigns it to the __version__ and version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily checks for Python version compatibility and loads a version string from a file. It performs a standard file read operation without any data processing or external communications. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The version check is straightforward and necessary for compatibility, and the file read is a simple operation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving basic compatibility and configuration purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
