  "purpose": "Define version information and enforce Python version requirements for the 'cqlib' package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'VERSION.txt' file for version info; reading sys.version_info for Python version check.",
  "sinks": "Reading 'VERSION.txt' file; raising SystemError if Python version is insufficient.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info (source) → Version check → potential SystemError; open('VERSION.txt') → read version → assign to __version__ and version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward version check and file read. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script enforces a minimum Python version (3.10.0), reads a version number from a local file, and assigns it to module variables. It performs standard operations with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. All file operations and checks are typical for package version management. The code adheres to good practices without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It ensures compatibility and reads version info from a local file, which is typical and safe.",
