  "purpose": "Define the version number and enforce Python version requirement for the cqlib library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION.txt' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Reading the version information from a file; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "File read operation directly assigns data to VERSION and __version__ variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and file read. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code enforces a minimum Python version and reads a version string from a local file. The version check is standard and uses the sys module. Reading the 'VERSION.txt' file is a normal operation; no data from untrusted sources is involved. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version enforcement and configuration snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
