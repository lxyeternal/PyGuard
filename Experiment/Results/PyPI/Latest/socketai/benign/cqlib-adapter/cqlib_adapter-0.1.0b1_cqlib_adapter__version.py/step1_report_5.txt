  "purpose": "To set up version information for the cqlib library and enforce minimum Python version requirement.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION.txt' file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading the version string from 'VERSION.txt' and assigning it to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version setup code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard initialization tasks: checking Python version, determining root directory, reading a version number from a text file, and assigning it to variables. The version check is a common safety measure. Reading a static version file does not involve untrusted data or potential injection. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The license comment indicates open-source intent, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard setup code for a Python package, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It enforces a Python version requirement and reads a version string securely from a file. No security issues identified.",
