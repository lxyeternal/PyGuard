  "purpose": "Enforces minimum Python version requirement and reads version information from a local file for package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'VERSION.txt' file from the local directory, accessing sys.version_info for environment check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data leakage involved.",
  "flows": "Version check via sys.version_info; reading version string from local file into variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment check and file read with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard Python environment validation and reads a version string from a local file. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior. The file reading is from a trusted local source, and the version check is a common practice. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is minimal, clear, and adheres to best practices for package setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and justified. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
