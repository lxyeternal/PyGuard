{
  "purpose": "The code sets up version control for the cqlib library, checks Python version compatibility, and reads the version number from an external file.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem with open(os.path.join(ROOT_DIR, \"VERSION.txt\"))",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from a file, sets version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The only file read is a local version file; no user input or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment checks and reads a static version number from a local file. It ensures compatibility with Python 3.10+, then loads version info from 'VERSION.txt' located in the same directory. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, no data exfiltration, nor any obfuscated or malicious code segments. It is standard setup code for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version loader and environment checker with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
