      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, security-conscious utility that manages pip error fixing with safeguards such as command filtering, URL validation, and user confirmation. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security concern is reliance on external AI suggestions, which could be exploited if the server is compromised, but this does not constitute malware within the code itself. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate (~0.2-0.4), justified by the external command execution based on AI input. The code's design and safeguards justify the low malware and obfuscation scores, with a moderate risk score due to external dependencies."

      "conclusion": "The code contains patterns indicative of potential malicious activity, primarily due to dynamic execution and secrets. While no active malware is confirmed, these patterns warrant further review in a secure environment. The overall security risk is moderate, and the likelihood of malicious intent is plausible but not definitive."
