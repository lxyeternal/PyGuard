  "purpose": "Analyze Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and data leaks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, external inputs, or untrusted data; uses eval/exec; handles secrets or sensitive info.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution points, network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input sources to eval/exec or network sinks, possibly via untrusted data flows that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation patterns, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution and hardcoded secrets, which are common vectors for malicious activity. The use of eval/exec with untrusted data indicates potential remote code execution risk. Obfuscation levels are moderate, with some patterns suggesting attempts to hide malicious intent. The code reads environment variables and possibly communicates externally, which could lead to data leaks or unauthorized control. No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but the suspicious behaviors justify a cautious stance. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score around 0.3 reflecting potential concern but not certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains patterns indicative of potential malicious activity, primarily due to dynamic execution and secrets. While no active malware is confirmed, these patterns warrant further review in a secure environment. The overall security risk is moderate, and the likelihood of malicious intent is plausible but not definitive.",
