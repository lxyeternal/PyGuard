{
  "purpose": "The code generates heatmap visualizations overlayed on whole slide images for analysis purposes, including normalization of scores, color mapping, and saving of results.",
  "sources": "Reading scores array, coordinates array, image region data from wsi object, reading and resizing images, reading region patches from wsi object, reading configuration data from wsi object, and accessing filesystem to save images.",
  "sinks": "Saving heatmap image file and top patches to specified directory; reading image regions from wsi; creating and saving images.",
  "flows": "Scores are normalized or used directly; overlay created from scores and coords; colormap applied; heatmap blended with base image; results saved to disk; top patches saved based on scores.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NaN in overlay to denote no data areas is normal; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; no obfuscation detected; standard image processing libraries used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard visualization tool for histopathology image analysis. It performs normalization, overlays heatmaps on images, and saves results. It reads image regions from a 'wsi' object, which is likely a specialized image class. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code, is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses common libraries for scientific computing and image processing. It simply processes and visualizes data without any covert or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for medical image analysis. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is to produce and save heatmap overlays and top-scoring image patches, with no indications of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
