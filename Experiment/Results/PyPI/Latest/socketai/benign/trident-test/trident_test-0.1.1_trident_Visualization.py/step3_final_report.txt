{
  "purpose": "The code generates heatmap overlays on whole slide images (WSI) based on provided scores and coordinates, applying color mapping and saving visualizations and top patches.",
  "sources": "Input scores, coordinates, and WSI region data; reads from WSI object; file I/O for saving images.",
  "sinks": "Saves heatmap images and top patch images to disk.",
  "flows": "Scores are normalized/ranked, overlays are created and color-mapped, then blended with WSI images; top patches are extracted and saved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing and visualization routines using common libraries. It reads input data, creates overlays, applies colormaps, blends images, and saves outputs locally. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network communication is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code. The file I/O operations are typical for visualization tools and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization utility for WSIs with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concerns related to file I/O, which is standard in such applications.",
