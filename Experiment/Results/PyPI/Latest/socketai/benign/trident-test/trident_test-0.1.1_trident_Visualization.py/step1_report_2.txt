{
  "purpose": "The code generates heatmap visualizations overlayed on whole slide images (WSI) based on provided scores and coordinates, saving the heatmap and optionally top scoring patches.",
  "sources": "Reads image data via wsi.read_region_pil, reads scores and coordinates as input parameters, reads and processes files from output directory.",
  "sinks": "Saves images to specified output directory; no network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Scores and coords are processed in create_overlay; overlay is applied and blended with WSI image; results saved to disk. Top patches are saved based on scores.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; use of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image processing and visualization tasks using common libraries (numpy, cv2, matplotlib, PIL). It normalizes scores, creates heatmap overlays, applies colormaps, and saves images. All data handling is local and for visualization purposes. No network communication, no data exfiltration, no malicious code behavior. Functions are well-structured and use standard techniques. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for slide images with no malicious intent. It safely processes input data, generates visual overlays, and saves output images locally. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
