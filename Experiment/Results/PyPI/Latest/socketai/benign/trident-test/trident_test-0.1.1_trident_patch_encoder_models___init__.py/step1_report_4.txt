  "purpose": "Import multiple encoder classes and a factory function from the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' module and define the module's public API with __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "Import statements, then listing of public classes and functions in __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code solely performs imports and __all__ definition without any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from a specific module and then defines __all__ to expose these components publicly. There are no dynamic imports, no execution of untrusted code, and no evident data leakage or malicious patterns. The code appears to serve as a module to re-export certain classes and functions for easier access in other parts of the application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely organizes imports and exports, which is common in Python package modules.",
