{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from a module within the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' package and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports all encoder classes and a factory function from the specified module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling are present; the code only performs imports and exposes symbols.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to module import and symbol export; no data flow from external inputs or outputs observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list declaration. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations. All imported elements are presumably classes or functions related to encoders. No signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, system modification, or covert communications are evident. The structure is standard for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical module import and export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares a set of encoder classes and a factory for use elsewhere.",
