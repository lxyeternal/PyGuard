  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from a specific internal package, then exposes them via `__all__`.\n- They consistently note the absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The code is standard for organizing and exposing module components, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code appears correct and consistent with typical Python module practices.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippet.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The highest scores are zero, which is justified.\n- If any report had assigned a higher risk, I would scrutinize whether that was justified, but here, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Malware considerations:**\n- The code performs only static imports and symbol exposure.\n- No malicious activity is indicated.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static analysis.\n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores align with the analysis—no false positives or negatives are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard module import/export pattern with no malicious or suspicious elements. The consistent, thorough reviews confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this correctly.",
