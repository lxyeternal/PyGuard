{
  "purpose": "This code imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from an internal module and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export only",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) lead directly to __all__ declaration (sink), with no dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import/export pattern, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements of classes and functions from an internal module, followed by an __all__ list to expose these symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code is a standard pattern for organizing module exports. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, as the code does not perform any insecure operations or data handling. The confidence in this assessment is 1, as the code is simple and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module for organizing and exposing classes/functions. There are no signs of supply chain security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
