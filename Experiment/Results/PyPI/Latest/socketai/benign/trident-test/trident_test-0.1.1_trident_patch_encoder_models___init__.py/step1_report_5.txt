{
  "purpose": "This code imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from a module within the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' and the list of exported class names",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; merely imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, listing multiple encoder classes and a factory function. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious patterns. The structure appears to be standard for module exports, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code seems to serve as an import hub for encoder components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting as an import and export module for encoder classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
