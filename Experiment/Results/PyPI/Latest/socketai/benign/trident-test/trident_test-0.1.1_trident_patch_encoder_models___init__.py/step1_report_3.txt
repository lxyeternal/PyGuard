{
  "purpose": "Import and expose various encoder classes and factory function from the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' module.",
  "sources": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "The import statements lead to the listed class/function names being available for use elsewhere; no data flows or processing are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports a set of encoder classes and a factory function from a module within the 'trident' package. It then explicitly defines the public API via '__all__'. There are no runtime data handling, user input, network operations, or sensitive data manipulations. The code appears to be a straightforward module export pattern without malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and export module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports specific classes and functions from another module, which is typical in Python package structuring.",
