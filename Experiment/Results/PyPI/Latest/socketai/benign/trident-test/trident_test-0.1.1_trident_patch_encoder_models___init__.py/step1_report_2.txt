{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple encoder classes and a factory function from a module within the 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load' package, and then exposes these via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module 'trident.patch_encoder_models.load', specifically importing classes and functions related to encoder models.",
  "sinks": "There are no external or untrusted data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations present.",
  "flows": "The imported classes and functions are made available for external modules, but there are no dynamic flows, data processing, or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with a typical import/export module.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of several encoder classes and a factory function from an internal module, then exposes them via the __all__ list. It does not execute any code at runtime beyond importing and listing available symbols. No suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The module seems designed for modular use within a larger project, providing access to various encoder models.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a standard module import and export pattern without any suspicious or harmful features.",
