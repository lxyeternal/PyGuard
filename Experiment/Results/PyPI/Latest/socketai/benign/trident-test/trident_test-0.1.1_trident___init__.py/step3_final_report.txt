  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure for the trident WSI processing package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the trident package modules related to WSI objects, visualization, processing, conversion, and maintenance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports and exposes classes/functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements with no dynamic code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup, importing various classes and functions from the trident package and defining __all__ for public API. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code is present. The reports provided are empty, offering no evidence of issues. Given the simplicity and clarity, there are no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code appears benign, and the absence of detailed reports prevents any further suspicion or concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports do not provide any evidence to challenge this assessment. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal, with malware and obfuscation scores set to zero.",
