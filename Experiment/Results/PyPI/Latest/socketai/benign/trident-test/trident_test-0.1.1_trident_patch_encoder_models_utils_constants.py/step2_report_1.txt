  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it defines constants and returns them based on a string input.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are evident.\n   - The control flow is simple and predictable.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** There are no issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n   - They correctly identify that the function simply returns predefined constants based on input.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining and returning constants with no malicious activity, risk scores should remain very low.\n   - The current scores (all zero) are justified.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score should be 0.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** No claims are unjustified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple utility for returning predefined normalization parameters. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
