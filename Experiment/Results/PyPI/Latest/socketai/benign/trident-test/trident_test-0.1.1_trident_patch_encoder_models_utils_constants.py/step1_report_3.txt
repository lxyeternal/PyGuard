  "purpose": "Define and retrieve normalization constants based on a specified normalization type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'norm' of the function 'get_constants'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing normalization constants based on 'norm' value, and the potential for raising a ValueError.",
  "flows": "Input 'norm' -> conditional checks -> return normalization constants or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple normalization constant lists for different datasets or models. The function 'get_constants' returns these constants based on the input parameter 'norm'. It includes multiple conditional branches for known 'norm' values and raises a ValueError for unknown inputs. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears straightforward, intended for setting normalization parameters in ML preprocessing, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for returning predefined normalization constants based on an input string. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
