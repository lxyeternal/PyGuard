{
  "purpose": "Defines normalization constants and provides a function to retrieve them based on a given normalization type.",
  "sources": "The function get_constants reads the input parameter 'norm'. No other external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external data; the function returns predefined constants.",
  "flows": "Input 'norm' flows into the conditional logic to determine which set of constants to return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple normalization constants for different models; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several constants representing mean and standard deviation values for different datasets or models. The function get_constants takes a string parameter and returns the corresponding constants. It uses straightforward if-elif logic, with a final exception raise for invalid inputs. No user inputs are processed from external sources, no code injection or malicious behavior evident, and no obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, harmless, and intended for setting normalization parameters in machine learning workflows. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities detected.",
