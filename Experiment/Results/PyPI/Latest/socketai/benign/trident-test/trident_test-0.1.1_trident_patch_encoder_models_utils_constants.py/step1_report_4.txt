  "purpose": "Define and return normalization constants based on specified normalization type",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'norm' in get_constants() function",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing normalization constants based on 'norm' value",
  "flows": "Input 'norm' -> conditional checks -> return corresponding mean/std constants",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward conditional logic with no suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple normalization constants as lists for different models and includes a function to retrieve these constants based on an input string. The function raises an error if an invalid normalization type is provided. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs simple data retrieval with input validation. No malicious behaviors or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing normalization constants. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
