  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is straightforward: it defines several normalization constants and a function `get_constants` that returns the appropriate constants based on a string input.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The function raises an exception for invalid inputs, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a simple utility for returning predefined constants.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are present in the reports.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's behavior.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.\n- The data is hardcoded and static.\n- The function is a utility, with no external dependencies or inputs that could be exploited.\n- Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward, static code analysis.\n- No assumptions about hidden behaviors are necessary or justified.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate throughout.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, static utility for returning predefined normalization constants.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
