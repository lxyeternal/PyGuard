{
  "purpose": "Provides normalization mean and standard deviation parameters for different datasets/models based on input string.",
  "sources": "The function get_constants reads the 'norm' parameter and returns predefined constants; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the function only returns static constants based on input.",
  "flows": "Input 'norm' parameter flows into conditional checks, leading to return of corresponding constants or raising an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple constant lists for normalization parameters and a function that returns these based on a string input. It raises an error for invalid inputs. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The control flow is simple, with clear mappings. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The function's purpose is benign, serving as a utility for normalization parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for returning predefined normalization parameters. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
