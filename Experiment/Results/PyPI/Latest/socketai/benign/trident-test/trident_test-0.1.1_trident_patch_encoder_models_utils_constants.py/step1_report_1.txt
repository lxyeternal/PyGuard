  "purpose": "Define and retrieve normalization constants (mean and std) for different datasets or models based on a given identifier.",
  "sources": "The function get_constants reads the input parameter 'norm' to determine which set of constants to return.",
  "sinks": "The function returns tuples of constants; no untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'norm' flows into conditional branches, which return corresponding constants without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code straightforwardly assigns predefined constants and raises an exception for invalid input.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple normalization parameter lists for different datasets. The function get_constants takes a string argument 'norm' and matches it against predefined cases. For each valid input, it returns the corresponding constants; for invalid input, it raises a ValueError. The code does not process external input directly (such as reading files, network, environment variables) nor does it execute untrusted code. The constants are hardcoded, and the control flow is simple, clear, and typical for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for returning predefined normalization parameters based on a string argument. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is a benign, well-structured snippet used for model preprocessing configuration.",
