  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining constants and returning them based on input.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The function raises a ValueError for invalid input, which is appropriate.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as expected.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- The code is a simple utility for returning predefined constants. There are no signs of malicious activity.\n- The only minor point is that if the code were part of a larger system, an attacker could potentially inject a malicious 'norm' string if the function is called with untrusted input, but since the function raises an exception for invalid input, this does not pose a security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe utility for returning normalization parameters. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
