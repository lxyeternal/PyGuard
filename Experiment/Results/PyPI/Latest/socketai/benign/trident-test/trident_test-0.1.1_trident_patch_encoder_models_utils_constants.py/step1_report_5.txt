  "purpose": "Define and retrieve normalization constants for different datasets or models based on a specified input parameter.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'norm' to the get_constants function, which is provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The return statements that output specific mean and standard deviation lists based on 'norm'. No direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The function reads 'norm' input, compares it to known values, and returns corresponding constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code simply manages constants and performs a straightforward conditional check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several lists of constants representing mean and standard deviation values for different normalization schemes. The get_constants function takes a string argument 'norm' and returns the corresponding mean and std lists. It uses if-elif-else statements for matching known schemes and raises an exception for unknown inputs. The data structures are simple, and the logic is straightforward without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No external inputs other than the 'norm' parameter are used, and no sensitive data or environment variables are accessed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for returning normalization constants based on an input string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
