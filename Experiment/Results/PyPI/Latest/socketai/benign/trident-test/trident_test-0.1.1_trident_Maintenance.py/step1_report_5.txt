{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated and issue a warning when such functions are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function name via func.__name__ within the decorator; no external input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code issues warnings using the warnings module, which could potentially expose function call information, but this is standard behavior and not malicious.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code only logs a warning when a deprecated function is called.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically manipulates the warnings filter to always emit deprecation warnings and then resets it, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a common pattern for deprecating functions using a decorator. It imports functools and warnings within the decorator function scope, which is acceptable. The decorator wraps the original function, issuing a deprecation warning every time the function is invoked. The warnings filter is temporarily set to always emit warnings, then reset to default, which is an unusual pattern but not harmful. There are no external data sources, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only issues warnings when deprecated functions are called. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
