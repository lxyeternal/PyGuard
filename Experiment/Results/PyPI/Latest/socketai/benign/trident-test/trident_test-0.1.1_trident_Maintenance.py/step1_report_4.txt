{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing a warning when such functions are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'func' argument, which is a function being decorated.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() call outputs a warning message, potentially to the console or log, but does not influence system security directly.",
  "flows": "Function call -> decorator wraps function -> warning issued upon function invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of warnings module is standard; no malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements a deprecated decorator, importing standard modules functools and warnings. It issues a deprecation warning every time the decorated function is called. No data leaks, no network activity, or malicious code present. The code’s structure and behavior are straightforward and typical for a deprecation decorator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
