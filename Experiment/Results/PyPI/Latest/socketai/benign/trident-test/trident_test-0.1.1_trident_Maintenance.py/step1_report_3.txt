{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated and issue a warning when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'func' parameter (the function being decorated) and imports modules 'functools' and 'warnings'.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a warning issued via the warnings module; no untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "The decorator wraps the original function to emit a warning before executing it, involving the function call and warning emission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library modules appropriately, and no suspicious or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard deprecation decorator using functools.wraps to preserve metadata. It dynamically imports 'functools' and 'warnings' within the decorator. When the decorated function is called, it temporarily adjusts warning filters to always emit a DeprecationWarning, issues the warning with the function's name, then resets the filter to default, and finally calls the original function. No external input or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not perform any malicious activity, data leakage, or security-sensitive operations. It is a straightforward utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a deprecation decorator with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. It’s safe and useful for signaling deprecated functions.",
