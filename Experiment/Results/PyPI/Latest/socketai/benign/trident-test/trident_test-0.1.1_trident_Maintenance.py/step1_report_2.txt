{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated and issue a warning when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'func' parameter (the decorated function). It also imports modules 'functools' and 'warnings'.",
  "sinks": "The code issues a warning via 'warnings.warn', which could potentially be manipulated if warnings are suppressed or redirected, but generally is safe.",
  "flows": "The decorated function 'new_func' wraps the original function 'func' and calls it after issuing a warning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of 'warnings' for deprecation notices is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'functools' and 'warnings', defines a decorator 'deprecated' that wraps a function, and issues a deprecation warning each time the function is called. It temporarily changes the warnings filter to always show the warning, then resets it. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common deprecation practices. No external data sources, no unsafe code, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply warns users when a deprecated function is called, following common coding practices.",
