{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing a warning when such functions are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function name via func.__name__ during warning generation.",
  "sinks": "The warning system outputs messages; no untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "Function call -> warning issued -> original function executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the warnings module is used normally.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard 'deprecated' decorator that wraps a function. When the decorated function is called, it temporarily sets the warning filter to always emit DeprecationWarning, then issues a warning with the function name, and resets the filter to default before executing the original function. The approach is typical for deprecation warnings and does not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard warning outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply issues a warning when deprecated functions are called, which is a common pattern.",
