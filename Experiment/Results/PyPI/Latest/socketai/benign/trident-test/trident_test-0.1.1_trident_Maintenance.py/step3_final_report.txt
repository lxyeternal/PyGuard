{
  "purpose": "This code implements a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing a warning each time such functions are called.",
  "sources": "The function name via 'func.__name__' and the call to the decorated function with *args and **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn call which outputs a DeprecationWarning message.",
  "flows": "Function call triggers warnings.warn, then the original function executes.",
  "anomalies": "The temporary setting of warnings filter to 'always' and resetting to 'default' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward deprecation decorator using standard modules. It issues warnings upon function invocation, with an unusual pattern of toggling the warnings filter. No external data, secrets, or malicious code are present. The pattern of changing warning filters is benign but atypical. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. The warnings filter manipulation does not pose a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deprecation decorator with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual warnings filter handling is harmless. All signals indicate a safe implementation.",
