  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured image processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concerns related to optional dependencies and dynamic imports are justified and do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is approximately 0.2, consistent with the detailed analysis."
