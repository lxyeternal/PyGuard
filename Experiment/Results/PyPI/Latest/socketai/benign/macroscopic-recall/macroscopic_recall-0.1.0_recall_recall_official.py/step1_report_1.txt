  "purpose": "Define a class for using OpenAI's official API to perform recall operations with provided prompts and data.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor (__init__), and recall method (response from API).",
  "sinks": "Response content from the OpenAI API call, potentially handling user prompts and recall data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token, prompts, recall data, question, model) are used to construct API request; response content is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious data handling; use of a standard openai library. No unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class RecallOfficial inheriting from Recall. It initializes an OpenAI client with an API key and base URL. The recall method constructs a message sequence combining system_prompt and recall_data, then makes a chat completion API call. The response's first message content is returned. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network or system calls, no data leakage points identified. The code appears straightforward, focusing on API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended for interacting with OpenAI's API for recall purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It relies on external input for API key and parameters, which should be managed securely. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
