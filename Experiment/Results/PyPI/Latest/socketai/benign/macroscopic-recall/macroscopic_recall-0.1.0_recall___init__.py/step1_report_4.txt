  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or data handling occurs in this fragment",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not include suspicious or unusual constructs. The author comment contains a future date (2025/4/27), which is uncommon but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import of two classes from local modules. It does not contain any network activity, data handling, or other potentially malicious operations. The only noteworthy aspect is the future date in the comment, which may indicate a typo or placeholder. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not exhibit malware or obfuscation, and the risk is negligible.",
