{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports two classes, RecallOfficial and RecallCustom, from local package modules.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, mainly consisting of import statements, with no apparent anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing two classes from local modules, likely part of a larger package. No user input handling, no external data reading, and no execution of dynamic code or network operations are evident. The filename and author comments do not indicate malicious intent. The imports are relative, suggesting this is a component of a larger, presumably benign, codebase. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard module import pattern within a larger project.",
