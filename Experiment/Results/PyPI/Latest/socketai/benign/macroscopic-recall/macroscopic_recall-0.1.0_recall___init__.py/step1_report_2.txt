  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that imports classes 'RecallOfficial' and 'RecallCustom' from local package modules, likely for some recall-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.recall_official' and '.recall_custom'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only imports classes and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is only importing modules without data manipulation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and follows standard import practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple module that imports two classes from sibling modules within the same package. There are no data inputs, external network communications, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The author information and date are present, but no indicators of malicious intent are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard import module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
