{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes 'RecallOfficial' and 'RecallCustom' from sibling modules, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No direct data input or external data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is depicted here; the code only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements from local modules. It includes metadata comments with author and date information. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is present. The date is set to a future year (2025), which is unconventional but not inherently malicious. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, network activity, or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import module with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports two classes for further use in a larger program.",
