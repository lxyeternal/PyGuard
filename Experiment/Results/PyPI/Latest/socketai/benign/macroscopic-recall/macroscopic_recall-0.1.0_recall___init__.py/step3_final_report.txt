{
  "purpose": "This code imports two classes, RecallOfficial and RecallCustom, from sibling modules within the same package, likely as part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files recall_official and recall_custom for class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or data leaks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the comment indicating a future date (2025/4/27), which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module with import statements, containing no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The comments include author and date metadata, with the date set in the future, which is likely a placeholder. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (0.1), justified by the minimal and benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating the code is clear and straightforward. Overall, the code poses no security threat and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score. The only minor note is the future date in comments, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood.",
