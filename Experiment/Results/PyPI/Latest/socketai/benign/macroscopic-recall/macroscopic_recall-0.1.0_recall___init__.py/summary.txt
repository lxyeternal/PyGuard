  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score. The only minor note is the future date in comments, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood."
