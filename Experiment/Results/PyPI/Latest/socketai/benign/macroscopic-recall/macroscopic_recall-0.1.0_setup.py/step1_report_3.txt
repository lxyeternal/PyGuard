  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'macroscopic_recall' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and long description from files and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious effects. No untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No malicious source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The script appears standard for a Python package setup with no unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, and reads long_description from a file. All elements are typical for a package setup. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. It does not include code execution, data transmission, or credential handling. The package dependencies are standard and non-malicious. The structure and content align with common setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for packaging a Python project. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
