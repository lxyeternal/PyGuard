  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'macroscopic_recall' to be published on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup; retrieving package requirements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file output of untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "Reading long_description from README.md -> passing it to setup() for package description; no other data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project, importing setuptools and defining package metadata and dependencies. It reads a markdown file for long description, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
