  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, static package metadata, dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data from package parameters and README.md used to configure package setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and typical for setup.py scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads static files and parameters without executing any dynamic code, network activity, or handling untrusted input. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic and scoring are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
