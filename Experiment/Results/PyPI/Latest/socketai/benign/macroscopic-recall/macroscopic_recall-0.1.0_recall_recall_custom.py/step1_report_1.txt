  "purpose": "Defines a custom recall class that allows users to specify their own recall function.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the recall() method, specifically *args and **kwargs passed to the user-defined recall_function.",
  "sinks": "The user-defined recall_function, which could potentially perform unsafe operations depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The recall() method passes all arguments to the recall_function, returning its result without modification or validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with minimal complexity; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The ASCII art at the top is cosmetic and unrelated to security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base class Recall from a relative module. It defines a class RecallCustom that inherits from Recall. The constructor accepts a recall_function, which it stores. The recall() method invokes this function with arbitrary arguments and returns its result. There are no hardcoded secrets, external system calls, or suspicious logic. The reliance on user-supplied functions introduces a potential security risk if the recall_function is malicious or unsafe, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure is simple and typical for callback or plugin-style design.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior; it acts as a wrapper allowing user-defined recall functions. The main risk depends on the implementation of the provided recall_function, which is external to this code. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident within this module.",
