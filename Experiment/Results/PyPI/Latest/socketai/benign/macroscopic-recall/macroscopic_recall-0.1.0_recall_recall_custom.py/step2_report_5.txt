  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code review:**\n\n- The code defines a class `RecallCustom` inheriting from `Recall`.\n- The constructor accepts a `recall_function` and stores it.\n- The `recall()` method calls `self.recall_function` with arbitrary arguments and returns its result.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The ASCII art is cosmetic and unrelated to security.\n\n**2. Security implications:**\n\n- The main concern is that `recall_function` is user-supplied and invoked directly without validation.\n- If `recall_function` is malicious, it could perform arbitrary actions, leading to security risks such as code injection or remote code execution.\n- The code itself is simple and does not contain malware or obfuscation.\n\n**3. Review of reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, acts as a wrapper, and relies on external functions.\n- They highlight that the primary risk is the potential maliciousness of the user-supplied `recall_function`.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), and malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores vary from 0.2 to 0.6, reflecting the potential danger if untrusted functions are used.\n\n**4. Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious code is present in this module.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious `recall_function`, a risk score of around 0.4-0.6 is reasonable if the function source is untrusted. The highest reported is 0.6, which aligns with this assessment.\n\n**5. Critical observations:**\n\n- The code is not malicious itself but facilitates execution of arbitrary user code.\n- The main security concern is external, not within this code snippet.\n- No assumptions about the `recall_function` are made; its safety depends on the caller.\n\n**6. Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign wrapper with potential security implications if used with untrusted functions.\n- The scores assigned in reports are reasonable.\n- No obfuscation or malware present.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if the context involves untrusted input, but as per the current code, 0.6 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.4 to 0.6** (depending on trust in `recall_function`; 0.6 used in reports is reasonable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code itself is safe but potentially dangerous if used with untrusted `recall_function`. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score should be around 0.4–0.6, depending on the context of usage. The reports' scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
