  "purpose": "A wrapper class that allows users to supply their own recall function, which is invoked dynamically.",
  "sources": "The recall_function provided during initialization, called within recall() with arbitrary arguments.",
  "sinks": "The recall_function executes with supplied arguments; if malicious, it could perform harmful actions such as code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from recall() to recall_function; external code execution depends on the supplied function.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class that executes a user-supplied function without validation, which introduces potential security risks if the function is malicious. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is external code execution. The scores across reports are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk varies from 0.2 to 0.6 depending on trust in the external function. A risk score of approximately 0.6 is justified given the potential for malicious behavior if untrusted functions are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and straightforward; the main security concern is executing untrusted external functions, which could be malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware and obfuscation score of 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.6) reflecting the potential danger of external code execution.",
