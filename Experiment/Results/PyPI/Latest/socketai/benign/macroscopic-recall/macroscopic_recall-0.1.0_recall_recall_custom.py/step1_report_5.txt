{
  "purpose": "Define a customizable recall class that inherits from a base Recall class and executes a user-provided recall function.",
  "sources": "The recall_function passed during initialization, which is stored as an instance attribute.",
  "sinks": "The recall_function is called in the recall method, executing user-provided code; potential for malicious behavior depends on this function.",
  "flows": "recall() method calls the user-supplied recall_function with provided arguments, executing arbitrary code if the function is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears straightforward and does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No external network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base class Recall from a local module and defines a new class RecallCustom that accepts a user-defined function. The recall method executes this function with arbitrary arguments. There are no suspicious or malicious operations directly in this code. However, the main security concern is the execution of external user-supplied code via recall_function, which could be malicious if the input is not controlled. The code itself is simple, clean, and does not perform any dangerous actions by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper allowing user-defined functions to be used as recall methods. It does not contain malicious code or malware itself, but executing untrusted functions could introduce security risks. Overall, the code is benign on its own but relies on the safety of the provided recall_function.",
