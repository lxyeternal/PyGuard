The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score. The only minor note is the future date in comments, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood."

The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware and obfuscation score of 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.6) reflecting the potential danger of external code execution."
