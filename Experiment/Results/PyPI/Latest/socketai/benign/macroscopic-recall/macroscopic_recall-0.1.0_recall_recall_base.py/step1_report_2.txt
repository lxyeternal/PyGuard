{
  "purpose": "This code reads JSON and CSV files, processes their content into a list of entries, and converts these entries into a Markdown formatted string.",
  "sources": "File input from the handle_file2md method, specifically via file_path parameter; reading from files in _csv2entries and _json2entries methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, databases, or perform network operations. It outputs a Markdown string generated from input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading in _csv2entries and _json2entries into entries lists, then into _convert_entries_to_md to produce Markdown output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity. The logic appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads JSON and CSV files, parses their contents into a list of dictionaries, then formats these into Markdown. File handling uses standard Python libraries, with safe reading practices. The conversion process involves string operations, list comprehensions, and safe data handling. No signs of malicious code, secret exfiltration, or sabotage are present. No external calls or unsafe operations are detected. The code functions as a typical data formatter without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a file parser and Markdown converter with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
