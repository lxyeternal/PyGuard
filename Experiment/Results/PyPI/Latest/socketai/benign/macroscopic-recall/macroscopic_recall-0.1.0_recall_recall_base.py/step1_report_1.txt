{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and convert data from JSON or CSV files into markdown format, likely for reporting or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "File input via file_path parameter in handle_file2md, _csv2entries, and _json2entries methods.",
  "sinks": "The code reads from files; it does not write untrusted data externally or transmit data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and parsed into data structures; data is then processed into markdown format in _convert_entries_to_md.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. Use of class methods and file handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input files (CSV or JSON), parses data into entries, then formats those entries into markdown. It performs typical file I/O with UTF-8 encoding, proper error handling for unsupported types, and standard parsing techniques. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious code are detected. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on data processing and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing utility with no malicious intent. It safely reads specified files, processes data into markdown format, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
