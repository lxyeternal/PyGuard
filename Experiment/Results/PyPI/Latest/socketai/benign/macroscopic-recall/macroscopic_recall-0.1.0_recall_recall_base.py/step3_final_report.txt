{
  "purpose": "The code reads JSON and CSV files, parses their contents into entries, and converts them into Markdown format for documentation or presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "File input via file_path parameter, reading from disk using open() for JSON and CSV files.",
  "sinks": "Generated Markdown string returned by _convert_entries_to_md; no external network or system calls.",
  "flows": "File reading functions (_csv2entries, _json2entries) process data from disk to in-memory data structures, which are then formatted into Markdown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles file input, supports only specified file types, and converts data into Markdown without external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The data parsing is standard, with validation for JSON structure. The overall design is simple and benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for converting JSON and CSV files into Markdown documentation. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are present. The security assessment aligns with the provided reports, which correctly identify the code as safe.",
