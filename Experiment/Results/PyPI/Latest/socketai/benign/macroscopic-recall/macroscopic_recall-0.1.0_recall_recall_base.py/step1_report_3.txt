  "purpose": "This code processes JSON and CSV files to generate markdown documentation from their contents.",
  "sources": "File paths provided to handle_file2md, _csv2entries, and _json2entries methods.",
  "sinks": "Reading from files specified by file_path in handle_file2md, _csv2entries, and _json2entries.",
  "flows": "File path inputs -> file reading functions -> data parsing -> markdown string generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No suspicious network activity or data leaks observed. The code performs standard file reading and data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Recall with methods to read JSON and CSV files, convert their data into a list of entries, and generate markdown documentation. The file handling is straightforward, with proper encoding and file opening. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious API usage. No external network activity, environment variable usage, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It strictly performs file parsing and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for processing JSON and CSV files into markdown format. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the provided code.",
