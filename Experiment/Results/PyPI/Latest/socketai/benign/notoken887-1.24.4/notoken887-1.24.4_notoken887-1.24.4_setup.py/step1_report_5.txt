  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "User input in setup() parameters, including package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code only defines package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious URL ('https://thugging.org') and a personal email address ('hitler@gmail.com') which could be intended for malicious or unprofessional purposes; no other unusual code behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with package metadata. The URL and email provided are unconventional and potentially malicious or unprofessional, possibly aiming to deceive or harm users. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The script solely provides package configuration details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration with suspicious metadata (notably the URL and email) that could indicate malicious intent or at least unprofessional conduct. There is no direct evidence of malicious code or malware, but the metadata should be reviewed further before trusting this package.",
