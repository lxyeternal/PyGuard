{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods to encode and decode strings using a custom substitution cipher, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The input string to the encrypt method and the encrypted token to the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "The functions output transformed strings; potential misuse could occur if these are used to obfuscate malicious payloads or data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encrypt() replaces characters with emojis -> output; Encrypted token -> decrypt() replaces emojis with characters -> output.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacements for obfuscation; no external data access, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher using emoji replacements. It contains symmetrical functions for encrypting and decrypting strings. There are no external data reads, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be obfuscation or encoding rather than malicious activity. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are present within this module. The code is straightforward and uses standard string replacement operations without obfuscation techniques or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a benign character-to-emoji substitution cipher primarily for encoding and decoding strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module. It appears to be a simple obfuscation utility rather than malware or a security threat.",
