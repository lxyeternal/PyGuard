{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple substitution encryption and decryption methods for transforming strings into emoji-based tokens and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in the 'encrypt' method and encrypted tokens in the 'decrypt' method.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; purely transforms data between formats.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via replacement in 'encrypt'; encrypted tokens are reverted via replacement in 'decrypt'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the substitution cipher is simplistic but not malicious. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward character replacements for obfuscation purposes. It does not include external data fetching, logging, or any system modification. The logic is limited to static substitutions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. Its primary purpose appears to be simple obfuscation using emojis. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected. Overall, the code appears benign with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple emoji-based substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and non-obfuscated beyond basic substitution, with no indications of malware or supply chain threats.",
