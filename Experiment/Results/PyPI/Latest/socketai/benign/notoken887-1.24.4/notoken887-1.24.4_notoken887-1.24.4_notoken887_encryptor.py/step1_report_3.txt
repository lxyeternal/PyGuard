{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for encoding and decoding strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, effectively implementing a simple character substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken as method arguments in encrypt() and decrypt() functions.",
  "sinks": "Output is the transformed string; no external sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace method in encrypt() → output encrypted string; encrypted string → replace method in decrypt() → output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs character replacement cipher; no hardcoded secrets, no external network operations, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward substitution cipher using emoji mappings for characters and digits, and reversing the mappings for decryption. It contains no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no access to environment variables or system resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The implementation is simple and transparent, serving only to obfuscate text via emoji substitutions. The code structure is clean, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a reversible emoji-based substitution cipher for string obfuscation. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it pose a security threat. It appears to serve purely for simple encoding/decoding purposes.",
