{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The methods 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' take input strings or encrypted tokens as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write data to external systems, send data over networks, or access environment variables; they only perform string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' method (character replacements) -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> 'decrypt' method (reverse replacements) -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward substitution without external communication, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic character substitution cipher, replacing alphanumeric characters and some symbols with emojis for 'encryption' and reversing this process for 'decryption'. It is a simple, static transformation without any network activity or malicious functions. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure is clear and direct, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a simple character mapping cipher. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to serve solely as an encoding/decoding utility with no hidden or harmful operations.",
