  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption of strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "The input strings to encrypt and decrypt methods; user input is not explicitly read within this code, but could be passed from outside.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is passed to encrypt method, transformed via character replacements; output is a string of emojis. The decrypt method reverses this process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs only character replacements; no hidden code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No external calls or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple reversible substitution cipher using emojis, with separate replace chains for encryption and decryption. The approach is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or sabotage. The replacement patterns are static, predictable, and involve no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. No anomalies such as hidden code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. It appears as benign encoding/decoding utility.",
  "conclusion": "The class is a benign, reversible emoji-based substitution cipher with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. No security issues or malware indicators are present.",
