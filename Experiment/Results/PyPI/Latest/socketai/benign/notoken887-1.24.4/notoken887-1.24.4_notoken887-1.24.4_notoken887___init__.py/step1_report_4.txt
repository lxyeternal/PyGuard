{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and utility functions, such as handling strings and performing calculations.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown, but functions may read data from parameters, environment variables, or external files if used in a larger context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions, but no explicit dangerous sink such as system calls or network activity is evident within the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or environment variables through processing functions, with no evident untrusted data flow leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation techniques are observed. The code uses standard language features and does not employ unnecessary dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows typical utility functions without suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network communications. The code structure and format are straightforward, and no anomalies indicating obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and consistent with normal functionality. Due to limited context, confidence is high that this is safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
