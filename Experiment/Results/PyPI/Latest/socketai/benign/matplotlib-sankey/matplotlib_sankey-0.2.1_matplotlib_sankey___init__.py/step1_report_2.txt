  "purpose": "Module exports for plotting, version, and utility functions related to Sankey diagrams",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._plotting, ._version, ._utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output; no network or system modifications",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules and defines the module's public API. There is no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, nor any suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be standard module initialization for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a typical module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to expose certain functions and variables for external use without any evident malicious or anomalous behavior.",
