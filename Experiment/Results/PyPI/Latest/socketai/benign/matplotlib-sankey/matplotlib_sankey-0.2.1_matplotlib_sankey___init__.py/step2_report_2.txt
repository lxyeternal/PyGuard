  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the provided reports and the original code to ensure consistency, correctness, and security assessment.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code imports three internal modules: `._plotting`, `._version`, and `._utils`.\n   - It exposes three symbols: `sankey`, `__version__`, and `from_matrix` via the `__all__` list.\n   - The code is a typical `__init__.py` setup for a Python package, used to define the public API.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No data handling, network activity, or external input processing is present.\n   - The code is standard package setup code.\n\n3. **Analysis of Scores**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import/export pattern.\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any suspicious or risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n   - The scores assigned seem appropriate and justified.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n   - The code is purely for module setup, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0, given the evidence.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is benign, standard package initialization code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- Maintain the current assessments, as they are consistent with the code and reports.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
