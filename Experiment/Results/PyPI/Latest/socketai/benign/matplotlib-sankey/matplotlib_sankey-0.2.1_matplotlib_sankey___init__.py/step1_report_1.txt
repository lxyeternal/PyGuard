{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a package, exposing specific functions and variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._plotting, ._version, and ._utils.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward and only expose functions/variables; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module __init__.py that imports internal functions and variables and defines what to export. It contains no input handling, no network or file operations, and no dynamic execution. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
