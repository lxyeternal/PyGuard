{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python package __init__.py file that imports internal modules (_plotting, _version, _utils) and exposes specific functions and variables (sankey, __version__, from_matrix) via __all__, establishing the public API.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports: ._plotting, ._version, ._utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network connections, or external input handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward module setup with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports internal components and defines __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the code's static and standard nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code structure aligns with typical package initialization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assigned scores are accurate and justified, and the code poses no security threat.",
