{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up module exports for a Python package, exposing specific functions and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._plotting, ._version, ._utils",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; module exports are static",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions and version info from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. It is a typical module initialization snippet for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a Python package's __init__.py file, used for organizing module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
