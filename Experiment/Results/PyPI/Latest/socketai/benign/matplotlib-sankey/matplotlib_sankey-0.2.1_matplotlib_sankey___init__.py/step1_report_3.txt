  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports specific functions and variables from internal submodules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._plotting, ._version, ._utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted input or external data",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns; straightforward import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions and variables from internal modules and declares what is exported. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The imports are relative, indicating internal package structure. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package module code used to expose selected internal functionalities. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns identified.",
