  "purpose": "This code appears to be a package's __init__.py file that exposes certain functions and variables for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_plotting, _version, _utils). No input or external data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; simply re-exports internal functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules and declares an __all__ list to define public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply exposes certain functions and variables for external use, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
