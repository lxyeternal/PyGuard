{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate Sankey diagrams using the matplotlib library and a supplementary module matplotlib_sankey.",
  "sources": "Data defined within the function as a list of tuples; the function itself does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks where untrusted data could leak or be exploited; it only calls plotting functions with predefined data.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'data' variable into the sankey() function calls, which then produce visual plots.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary plotting libraries, defines a function to generate multiple Sankey diagrams with various parameters, and calls this function. It uses static data for plotting, with no external input or data manipulation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable. The code's structure and content are typical for visualization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply creates plots for data visualization purposes.",
