{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate Sankey diagrams using the matplotlib library and a custom 'matplotlib_sankey' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data defined within the function. No external inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the predefined 'data' variable into the 'sankey' function calls to generate visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard plotting libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports plotting libraries, defines a test function that creates Sankey diagrams with various configurations, and does not include external data inputs, network operations, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and intended for visualization purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign visualization script that generates Sankey diagrams. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
