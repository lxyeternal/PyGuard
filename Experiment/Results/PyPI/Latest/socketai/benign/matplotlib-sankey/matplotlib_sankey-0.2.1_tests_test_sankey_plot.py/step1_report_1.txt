{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate Sankey diagrams using the matplotlib and matplotlib_sankey libraries for data visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded data for plotting; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded 'data' variable into the 'sankey' function calls to generate visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code, hidden code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports visualization libraries and defines a function to produce Sankey diagrams with various parameters. It uses static data within the code and calls visualization functions without user input, network operations, or environment variable usage. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data processing are evident. The code is straightforward and intended for plotting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data visualization script for generating Sankey diagrams. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
