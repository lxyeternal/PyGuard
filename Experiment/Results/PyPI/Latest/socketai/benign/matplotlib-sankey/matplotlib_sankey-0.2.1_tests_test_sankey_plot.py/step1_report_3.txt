{
  "purpose": "To generate Sankey diagrams using the matplotlib and matplotlib_sankey libraries for data visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data defined within the function, which is explicitly provided in the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or external data sources; the code only uses predefined data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process external inputs or untrusted sources that could influence outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard library functions for visualization without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard visualization libraries, defines a function to create Sankey plots with various configurations, and calls the plotting functions with hardcoded data. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and purely for visualization purposes. It neither takes user input nor performs any system modifications. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign visualization example for generating Sankey diagrams. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is simple and safe for use.",
