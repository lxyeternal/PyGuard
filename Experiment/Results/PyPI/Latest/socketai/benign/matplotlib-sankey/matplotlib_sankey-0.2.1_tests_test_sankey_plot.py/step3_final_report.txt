{
  "purpose": "Generate multiple Sankey diagrams using static, predefined data for visualization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Static data within the function; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions rendering diagrams; no data leaks or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal static variables into plotting functions; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward code with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard visualization libraries, defines a function that creates multiple Sankey diagrams with hardcoded data, and does not process external inputs or perform network operations. It is a simple visualization script with static data, clear structure, and no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, which aligns with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data visualization routine with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
