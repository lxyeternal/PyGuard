{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for utility functions related to colormap generation and matrix processing, likely used for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded data within test functions; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present that handle untrusted or external data; the code solely performs assertions on internal data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all data is predefined within the test functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions that verify the behavior of utility functions from the 'matplotlib_sankey' package. It uses static, hardcoded test data and performs assertions to ensure expected types and output lengths. There are no external input reads, no data leaks, and no network operations. The functions serve as internal tests and do not contain any malicious or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit test setup for visualization utilities. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and standard for testing purposes.",
