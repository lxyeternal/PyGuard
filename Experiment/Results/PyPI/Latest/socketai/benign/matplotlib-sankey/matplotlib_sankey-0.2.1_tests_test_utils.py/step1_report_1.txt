{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for utility methods related to color map generation and matrix processing in the matplotlib_sankey package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static input data within test functions; no external or untrusted sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions such as network communication or file access.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only processes predefined data within test functions without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard library functions and straightforward assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions that invoke utility functions (_generate_cmap and from_matrix) with controlled, static input data. There is no user input, external data sources, or untrusted data handling. The functions check the type and output properties, typical for unit tests. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or potential backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard unit test code for internal utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
