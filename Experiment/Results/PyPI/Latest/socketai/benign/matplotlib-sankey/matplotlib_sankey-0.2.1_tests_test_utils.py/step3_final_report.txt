{
  "purpose": "The code contains two unit test functions for internal utility functions: '_generate_cmap' for generating colormaps, and 'from_matrix' for processing matrices. The tests verify output types and properties with static inputs.",
  "sources": "The functions are invoked with static, controlled data within the test functions; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code performs internal assertions without data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal function calls with predefined inputs; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing for visualization utility functions, with static inputs and assertions. No external data, network, or file operations are involved. The functions tested are common utilities, and the tests only verify expected types and properties. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and controlled inputs justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is standard testing code for internal utilities, and the current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
