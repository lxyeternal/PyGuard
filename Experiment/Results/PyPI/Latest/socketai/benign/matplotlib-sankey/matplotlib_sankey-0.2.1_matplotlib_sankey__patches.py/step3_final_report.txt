  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating matplotlib PathPatch objects for Sankey diagram visualization, generating shapes like lines and curves based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing coordinate points, spacing, alpha, and optional color; no external data sources or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Generated PathPatch objects used for plotting; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into vertices and path codes to produce shape patches; no external data flow or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected; standard use of matplotlib classes and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions that generate matplotlib PathPatch objects with specified vertices and path codes for visual elements. It uses standard libraries and simple geometric calculations, with no external data access, network activity, or malicious behavior. The functions are parameterized for flexibility but do not process untrusted data or perform any security-sensitive operations. The code is clean, well-structured, and serves as a visualization utility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualization purposes, and contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
