  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the provided code, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; no data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no sinks detected due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; no code execution paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code, noting that analysis cannot be performed. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately set to zero or very low, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The cautious approach is consistent across reports, with no false positives or negatives. Given the complete absence of code, the security posture is considered benign, and no further anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent, correctly reflecting the absence of code and malicious indicators. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security assessment indicates no current supply chain risks or malicious behavior.",
