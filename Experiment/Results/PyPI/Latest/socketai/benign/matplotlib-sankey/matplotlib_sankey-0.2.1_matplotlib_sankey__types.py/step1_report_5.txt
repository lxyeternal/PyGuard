  "purpose": "Define type aliases for curve types and accepted colors for plotting functions or visualization settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, typing, and matplotlib.colors; definition of type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; type alias definitions are static and do not involve data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports standard library and third-party modules for type annotations and color handling. It then defines type aliases for specific string literals, sequences, colormaps, and tuples. There is no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations for visualization configurations, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a safe and standard code snippet intended for type hinting.",
