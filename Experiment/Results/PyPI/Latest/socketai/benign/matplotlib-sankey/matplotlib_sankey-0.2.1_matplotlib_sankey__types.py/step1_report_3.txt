{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for different types of curve identifiers and accepted color formats for use in plotting or visualization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data reading; only type annotations and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard library and third-party imports without suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard collections and typing modules, as well as a specific class from matplotlib.colors. It defines two type aliases: CurveType as a Literal of specific string values, and AcceptedColors as a union of multiple color representation formats including sequences of strings, colormaps, strings, or sequences of RGB float tuples. No user input, data handling, or untrusted sources are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger visualization system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup of type aliases for visualization purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard, safe, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code.",
