  "purpose": "Define type aliases for curve types and accepted colors for use in plotting or visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, typing, and matplotlib.colors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code only defines types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares type aliases and imports modules relevant to data visualization. It does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could lead to security issues. All imported modules are standard and do not pose security risks. The type definitions serve as documentation and type hinting within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious module defining type aliases for visualization purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
