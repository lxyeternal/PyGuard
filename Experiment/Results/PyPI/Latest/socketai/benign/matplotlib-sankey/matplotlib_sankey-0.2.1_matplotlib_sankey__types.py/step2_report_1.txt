  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the original code and the context.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is straightforward: it imports standard modules and defines type aliases.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, or input/output handling.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The type aliases are meant for static type checking and documentation within a larger visualization codebase.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the Code:\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code.\n- The type aliases (`CurveType` and `AcceptedColors`) are correctly defined.\n- The imports are standard and safe.\n\n### Security & Malware Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the code being purely declarative and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Code:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors are present.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is only defining types and imports, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n- Since the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute any logic, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Additional Justifications:\n- The code does not include any suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n- The use of standard libraries and clear type annotations confirms benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk from static type definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a purely declarative purpose within a visualization or plotting system.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-understood pattern for defining type aliases for visualization parameters. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
