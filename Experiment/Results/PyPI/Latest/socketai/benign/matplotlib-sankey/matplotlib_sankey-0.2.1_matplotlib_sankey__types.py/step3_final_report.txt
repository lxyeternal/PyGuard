  "purpose": "Define type aliases for visualization parameters, specifically 'CurveType' and 'AcceptedColors'.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'collections.abc', 'typing', and 'matplotlib.colors'; type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data flow operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares types and imports, with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type alias definitions with standard imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines two type aliases for visualization parameters. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as documentation or type hints within a larger visualization system. Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious constructs, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. All reports correctly identify this benign nature and assign appropriate scores. The code is safe, clear, and standard for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of type alias definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
