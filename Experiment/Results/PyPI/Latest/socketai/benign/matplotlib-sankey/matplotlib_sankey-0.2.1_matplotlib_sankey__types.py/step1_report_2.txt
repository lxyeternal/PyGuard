  "purpose": "Define type aliases for curve types and accepted colors for plotting with matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'collections.abc', 'typing', and 'matplotlib.colors'. TypeAlias declarations for 'CurveType' and 'AcceptedColors'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output generation observed.",
  "flows": "Type aliases are defined without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports standard library and third-party modules, defines type aliases for use elsewhere. No runtime data processing, user input handling, or output occurs here. The type aliases specify expected data structures for plotting functions, with no dynamic or executable code that could be malicious. The imports are standard and do not indicate any malicious behavior. Overall, the code is purely declarative and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias definition for plotting parameters, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
