  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code only defines type aliases and imports standard modules (`collections.abc`, `typing`, `matplotlib.colors`).\n- No data processing, input handling, network activity, or execution logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be documentation and type hinting for visualization functions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**: All uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and only declares type aliases for plotting purposes. They correctly identify that there are no data sinks, no malicious code, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Security and malware scores**: All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. The confidence is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and concerns:\n\n- **Code correctness**: The code matches the original snippet. No issues or anomalies are present.\n- **Malicious activity**: None detected; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Obfuscation**: None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities**: None, since no data handling or execution occurs.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0)**: Appropriate, as the code poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, all reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a simple, safe set of type alias definitions with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No changes needed. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that in larger codebases, such type alias files are integrated properly, but as-is, this code is safe and standard.",
