  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines type aliases and imports standard modules.\n- No untrusted data handling, input/output, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints for visualization functions.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- Since the code only declares types and imports standard modules, there is no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.\n- The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are uniform and consistent; they all correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n- The logic, reasoning, and summaries are accurate and aligned.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely for type hinting.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The risk score should remain 0.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- No changes needed. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the code snippet.",
