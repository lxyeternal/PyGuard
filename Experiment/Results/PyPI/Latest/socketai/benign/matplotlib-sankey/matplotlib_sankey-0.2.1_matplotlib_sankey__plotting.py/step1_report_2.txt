{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to generate a Sankey diagram visualization using matplotlib, plotting hierarchical flow data with customizable aesthetics.",
  "sources": "Input data parameter for flow data; internal imports; matplotlib functions; data processing loops; text annotations; legend handling.",
  "sinks": "Adding patches for visual elements; optional text annotations; legend patches; setting axis labels and titles.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Data processing loops -> Patch creation and addition -> Optional annotations and legend.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of insecure functions or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data aggregation, plotting rectangles for data columns, and ribbons connecting related data points across columns. Uses standard matplotlib functions, with proper input validation and plotting logic. No suspicious data leaks, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code focuses solely on visualizing flow data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for visualizing Sankey diagrams using matplotlib. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and does not perform any insecure operations.",
