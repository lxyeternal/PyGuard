{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function for creating Sankey plots using Matplotlib, visualizing data flows between columns with customizable aesthetics and labels.",
  "sources": "The data parameter (input data for the plot), configuration parameters (e.g., colormap, labels), and internally generated data structures for plotting and legend creation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send data over the network, access environment variables, or execute untrusted code. It solely generates visualizations locally.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed to compute weights and rectangle positions (sources) and then used to draw rectangles and ribbons on the axes (sinks), without external data transmission or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard plotting tasks with clear parameter handling and plotting logic.",
  "analysis": "The function performs data validation, initializes plotting axes, computes weights and positions for rectangles representing data columns, and then creates ribbons connecting these rectangles based on provided data. It offers customization options for aesthetics and labels, but all operations are confined to visual rendering with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data access involved. The code appears to be a well-structured plotting utility designed for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign visualization function with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely manipulates local plotting objects to generate a Sankey diagram, adhering to typical coding practices for such tasks.",
