{
  "purpose": "This code generates a Sankey diagram for visualizing flow data between columns, utilizing matplotlib for plotting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as 'data', 'column_labels', 'legend_labels', and optional 'ax'.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib patches and text annotations for rendering visual elements; no data leakage or external system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through processing steps to the plotting functions, ultimately rendering graphical elements on the axes.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious code, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors. There are no hidden or obfuscated behaviors. The code relies on well-known matplotlib functions and utility functions (presumably safe) for plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data aggregation, normalization, and plotting to create a Sankey diagram. It calculates weights, manages colors via colormaps, and plots rectangles and ribbons to represent flows. It includes standard validation checks and optional legend and labels. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is straightforward, with proper parameter validation and usage of safe plotting libraries. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard visualization function for creating Sankey diagrams using matplotlib. It appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses solely on plotting based on provided data and parameters, with no external or secretive operations.",
