{
  "purpose": "The code implements a function to generate Sankey plots with customizable data, colors, labels, and visual styles using Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are read from the 'data' parameter; color specifications from 'cmap' and 'ribbon_color'; axis labels from 'column_labels' and 'title'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence label text or colors if provided externally, but no explicit untrusted data sink is evident beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed to generate rectangles and ribbons on the plot, with no indications of untrusted data flow leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears standard for plotting routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'sankey' function to create visual diagrams. It reads data and parameters, validates 'rel_column_width', sets up axes, processes data into column weights, and plots rectangles and ribbons based on the data. It supports customizable colors, labels, and curves. No external network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted code are detected. The logic strictly pertains to plotting using provided data and parameters, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward visualization function with no malicious behavior detected. It handles input data safely, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to generate Sankey plots for data visualization.",
