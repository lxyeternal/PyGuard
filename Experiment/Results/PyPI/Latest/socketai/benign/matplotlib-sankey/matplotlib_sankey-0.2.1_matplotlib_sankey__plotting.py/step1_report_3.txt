{
  "purpose": "The code generates a Sankey diagram visualization using matplotlib, allowing customization of data, appearance, and labels.",
  "sources": "Data input parameter 'data'; configuration parameters such as 'cmap', 'title', 'column_labels'; and internal functions that generate colormap and clean axes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems; only graphical rendering with matplotlib patches and labels.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through processing and plotting functions to visual patches on axes; no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors present. Use of plotting functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily constructs a visualization of data using matplotlib, involving data aggregation, plotting rectangles, ribbons, and optional labels and legends. Data is processed to compute rectangle positions and sizes based on weights, with standard plotting calls. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, such as network communication, file manipulation, or credential handling. The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization function for Sankey plots with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It safely processes input data and renders visual elements, with no external or covert operations identified.",
