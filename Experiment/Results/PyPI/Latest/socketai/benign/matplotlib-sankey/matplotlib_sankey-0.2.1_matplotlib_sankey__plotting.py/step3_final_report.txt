  "purpose": "A function to generate Sankey diagrams for visualizing flow data with customizable options such as colors, labels, and styles.",
  "sources": "Input data list of tuples representing source, target, and weight; parameters for labels, colors, and styling options.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib patches and text annotations for rectangles and ribbons; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data through processing into rectangle positions and ribbon connections, ultimately rendered as patches on a matplotlib axis.",
  "anomalies": "Potential logical bug in handling 'column_weights' initialization (checking for None on dict objects initialized as {}). No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code processes input data to compute rectangle positions and sizes for each column, then draws rectangles and ribbons to visualize flows. It uses standard matplotlib patches and functions, with no external network or file operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's purpose is purely visualization, and it does not perform any insecure operations. The data processing and plotting are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility for Sankey diagrams. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
