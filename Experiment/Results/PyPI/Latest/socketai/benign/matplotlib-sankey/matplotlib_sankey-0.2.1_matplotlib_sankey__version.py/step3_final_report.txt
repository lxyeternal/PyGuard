{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the package metadata, serving as a simple identifier.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward variable assignment with no obfuscation or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard declaration of a version string in Python. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious patterns, external calls, or hidden behaviors are present. Given the lack of any external interactions or complex logic, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
