  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external communication, or malicious code.\n   - The code snippet is straightforward and typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is trivial, there's no justification for a higher score.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat, so the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` as 0, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no malicious instructions, so this score is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk associated with this code snippet.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, harmless package version declaration. All reports are accurate, and their scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe and typical for package metadata.",
