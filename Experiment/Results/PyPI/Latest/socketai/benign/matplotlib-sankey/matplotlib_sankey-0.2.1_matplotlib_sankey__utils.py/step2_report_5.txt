  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states the code is benign, performing standard visualization utilities with no malicious behavior. The functions involve axis cleaning, colormap generation, and matrix-to-connection conversion, all typical for visualization code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95\n\n- **Justification:** Given the benign nature and straightforward operations, a high risk score (0.95) seems unwarranted. The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain obfuscation. The high score appears unjustified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the functions, with no external effects or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis. The report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, utility functions with no malicious intent. No network or file I/O, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n- **Justification:** Fully consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Utility functions for visualization, with validation checks and no external system interaction. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score matches the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, standard utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely utility-focused, with no network, file, or command execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **High risk (0.95) in Report 1:** This appears inconsistent. The code is standard visualization utility code, not a security risk. Therefore, this score should be lowered to match the others.\n\n### **Overall Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Low, consistent with utility functions that could potentially be misused if integrated into malicious workflows, but on their own, benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility module for visualization and data processing, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The high risk score in the first report should be adjusted downward for consistency.",
