  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, straightforward utility functions, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious behavior, standard validation, low security risk (0.1), malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; the reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no malicious activity, high confidence, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion; code appears safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions with input validation, no external system interactions, no obfuscation, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, standard processing, no suspicious patterns, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm the code is present, performing standard visualization and data processing tasks.\n- **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation:** No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, mainly due to potential misuse of visualization functions if fed malicious data, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Scores Justification:** Since the code is benign, the malware score remains at 0, and obfuscated score at 0.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, related to potential misuse but no actual security flaw.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all findings are based on code analysis.\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for visualization and data transformation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, primarily related to potential misuse rather than actual vulnerabilities.",
