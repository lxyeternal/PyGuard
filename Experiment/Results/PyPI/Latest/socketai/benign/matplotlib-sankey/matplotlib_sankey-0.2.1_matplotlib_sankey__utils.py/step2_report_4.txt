  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard visualization utilities; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95 (high confidence in benign nature).\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the functions' purpose. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; safe data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign analysis. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate visualization utilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The maximum risk score (1) is perhaps slightly overcautious, but given the functions are purely data processing and visualization, it's acceptable. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Visualization utilities; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Enforces input validation, no unsafe code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score appears conservative; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing for visualization; no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard operations with validation.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate low-risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are mostly high (around 0.9-1), indicating a perceived high risk, but the code is benign. Given the code's utility nature, such high scores are overly cautious.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Since the code is benign, the risk should be low.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, aligned with benign utility code.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent in their benign assessment. The high risk scores seem overly cautious given the code's straightforward nature. I recommend lowering the overall risk score to around 0.1, reflecting the benign, utility-focused purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1**\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis, ensuring a balanced view that recognizes the code's utility nature without overestimating potential threats.",
