  "purpose": "Utility functions for axis management, colormap generation, and matrix-to-connection conversion in visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (e.g., axis object, color specifications, matrices, index lists).",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or external system interactions; data is processed internally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and processed within functions; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward validation and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard visualization utilities with input validation, color map handling, and matrix transformation functions. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The functions perform typical tasks with proper validation, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The high risk scores in some reports are overly conservative given the benign nature of the code. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, with low security risks. The only concern is the high risk score in the first report, which should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for visualization and data transformation, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall security assessment should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, aligning with the benign nature and minimal security concern.",
