  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating matplotlib axes, colormaps, and converting a matrix into source-target-weight tuples for visualization.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters (e.g., 'value', 'mtx', 'source_indicies', 'target_indicies') and imported modules (e.g., numpy, matplotlib).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not perform external network communication, file access, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through validation and conversion functions, but no data flows into untrusted external systems or triggers malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code contains standard plotting and data processing logic with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation, data transformation, and plotting utilities with no evidence of malicious intent. Functions convert color specifications and matrix data into visualization components or data tuples. No network operations, file I/O, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for visualization purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
