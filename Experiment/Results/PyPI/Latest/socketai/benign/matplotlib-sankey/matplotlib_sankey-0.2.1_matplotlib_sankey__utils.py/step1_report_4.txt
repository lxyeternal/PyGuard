{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for cleaning matplotlib axes, generating colormaps, and converting matrices to source-target-weight triplets, likely for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads external inputs via function parameters such as 'value', 'mtx', 'source_indicies', and 'target_indicies'. It also uses imported modules and functions, especially from numpy and matplotlib.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'set_xticklabels', 'set_yticklabels', 'set_xticks', 'set_yticks', and colormap generation functions, which could be manipulated if untrusted data is provided. The 'from_matrix' function outputs a list of tuples which could be used downstream for visualization or processing.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (like 'value' and matrix data) flows into colormap generation and matrix processing functions, which then produce visual or data outputs. There are no explicit network or file operations, but data could be exfiltrated if misused downstream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The functions appear to perform standard utility operations. Assertion checks ensure input validity, and no dynamic code execution or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions related to visualization with matplotlib and data processing. The functions enforce input validation (e.g., colormap name validation and dimension assertions). The colormap conversion handles different input types safely without executing untrusted code. The matrix conversion function filters zero or negative weights, returning a list of meaningful source-target-weight tuples. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any suspicious operations. No evidence of obfuscation or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for visualization and data processing, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The security risk score is low, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
