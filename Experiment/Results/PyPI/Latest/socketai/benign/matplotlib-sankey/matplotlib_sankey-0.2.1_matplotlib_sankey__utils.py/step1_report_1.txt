{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for visualizing matrices, generating colormaps, and cleaning matplotlib axes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as 'value' (AcceptedColors), 'mtx' (matrix data), and index lists ('source_indicies', 'target_indicies').",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions to modify axes and generate colormaps; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'mtx', 'value', index lists) flows through functions to produce visual properties or connections; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variables are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: cleaning axes, generating colormaps, and converting matrices to source-target-weight tuples. Colormap generation checks the type and validity of input. Matrix conversion validates dimensions and constructs tuples based on positive weights. No network access, system modifications, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for visualization and data processing, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified.",
