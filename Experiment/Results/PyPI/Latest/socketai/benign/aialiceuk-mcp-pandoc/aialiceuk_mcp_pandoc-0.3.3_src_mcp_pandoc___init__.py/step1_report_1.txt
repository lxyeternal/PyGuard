{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to serve as an entry point that runs an asynchronous server module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a local module named 'server'. It does not read environment variables or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code executes server.main() asynchronously, which could be a sink if server.main() contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "No external input flows into the code; the flow is simply calling server.main() via asyncio.run(), which is a direct call without manipulation or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It merely calls a function from a local module.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main function that runs server.main() asynchronously, which suggests it's a launcher for server-related operations. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources evident. The import is local, and the code is minimal. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The structure is typical for Python package entry points.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign entry point for launching server operations. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident from this snippet.",
