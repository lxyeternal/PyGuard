{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a package, primarily invoking the main function from a local server module within an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data directly; it imports a local module 'server' and calls its main function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only calls server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: main() calls asyncio.run(server.main()), which executes the server module's main function asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local server module and runs its main() function within an asyncio event loop. It serves as a simple orchestrator. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data leaks, or malicious code. The __all__ declaration exposes main and server, which is typical for package entry points. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting solely as a package entry point that delegates execution to a server module. No malicious or security-related issues are evident.",
