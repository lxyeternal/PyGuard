{
  "purpose": "The code defines an entry point that runs the 'main' function from a local 'server' module within an asynchronous event loop.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'server' module and reads nothing from untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'server.main()' within asyncio.run(), which executes the server's main function.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts from main(), which calls asyncio.run(server.main()), executing the server's main logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for an entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local 'server' module and defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. It exposes 'main' and 'server' via __all__ for external access. No untrusted data sources, no data sinks involving external systems, and no suspicious code structures. The code appears to serve as a simple entry point for starting a server process, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign entry point for initializing server functionality. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
