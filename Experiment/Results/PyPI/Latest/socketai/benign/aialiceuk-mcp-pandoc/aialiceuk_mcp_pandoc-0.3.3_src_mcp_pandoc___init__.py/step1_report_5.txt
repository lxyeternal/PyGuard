{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a package, running an asynchronous server module's main function.",
  "sources": "Imports of local 'server' module and use of 'asyncio.run' to execute 'server.main()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'server.main()' which may contain untrusted operations; no explicit sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'server.main()' via 'asyncio.run', but no details of 'server.main()' are provided; potential data flow depends on 'server' module content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module 'server' and executes its 'main()' function asynchronously. It acts as a simple orchestrator. Without insight into 'server.main()', no malicious or maliciously intended code can be inferred. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows typical Python package patterns. No obfuscation, no suspicious data handling, and no external data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
