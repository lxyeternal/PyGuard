  "purpose": "Main entry point for a package that runs an asyncio server module.",
  "sources": "Importing server module, reading the main() function from server, and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Calls server.main() within asyncio.run(), which is a controlled function call; no data flow from external untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local server module, defines a main() function that executes server.main() within asyncio's event loop, and sets __all__ for module exports. It is a minimal, conventional entry point with no apparent malicious behavior. There are no suspicious data flows, no external communications, and no unusual coding patterns. The code relies on the server module for functionality, which is outside the scope of this fragment. Overall, the code is simple and standard for an asyncio-based server entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, benign entry point for starting a server. No malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks are evident.",
