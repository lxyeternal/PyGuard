  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static setup script defining package metadata with no dynamic elements, input handling, or code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify high confidence in its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
