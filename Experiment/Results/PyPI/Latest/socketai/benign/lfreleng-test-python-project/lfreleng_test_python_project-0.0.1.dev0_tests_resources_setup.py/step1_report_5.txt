{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, description, URL, author, author_email, license, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup configuration uses hardcoded static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. The license comment is standard, and the setup call is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no input or data processing steps, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. All elements are typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for packaging purposes.",
