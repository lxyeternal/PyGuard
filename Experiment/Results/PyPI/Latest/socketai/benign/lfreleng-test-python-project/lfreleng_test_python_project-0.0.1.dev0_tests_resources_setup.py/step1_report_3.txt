  "purpose": "Define the package metadata for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, description, url, author, author_email, license, packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs observed in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are static strings and data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata about a Python package. It specifies package info such as name, version, description, URL, author details, license, and packages list. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The script is typical for packaging and distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. The code appears to be for legitimate package distribution purposes.",
