{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a CLI application built with Typer, verifying command outputs and behavior.",
  "sources": "The tests invoke CLI commands with controlled arguments and environment variables; subprocess runs coverage measurement on the CLI module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; subprocess executes a controlled command; environment variables are used for formatting only.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and environment variables are passed to CLI commands; subprocess runs a coverage module with fixed parameters; no data leaks or malicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present; code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite with controlled inputs, standard subprocess usage, and no malicious payloads. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The subprocess call is typical for coverage testing, not malicious activity. Environment variables are used for formatting, not malicious purposes. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with safe testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite for a CLI application with no malicious or security issues. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
