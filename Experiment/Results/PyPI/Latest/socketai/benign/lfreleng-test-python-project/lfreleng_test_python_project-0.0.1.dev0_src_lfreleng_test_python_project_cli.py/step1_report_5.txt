  "purpose": "A simple CLI application that provides greeting and farewell commands using the Typer library.",
  "sources": "User input for 'name' and 'formal' parameters in command functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting greeting messages; no data sinks that lead to data leaks or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('name', 'formal') are received from user commands and directly used in print statements; no further data processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code constructs observed. The code is straightforward and does not perform any unexpected actions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a basic CLI tool using Typer, with commands that print greetings based on user input. There are no external data transmissions, no insecure operations, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code structure is simple, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present. It functions solely as a command-line interface with user-provided parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI application with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses user input for display purposes only, with no external data handling or suspicious activity detected.",
