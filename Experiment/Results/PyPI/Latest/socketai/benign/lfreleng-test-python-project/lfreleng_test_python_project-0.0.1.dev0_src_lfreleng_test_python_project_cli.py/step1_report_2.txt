{
  "purpose": "A simple command-line application providing greeting and farewell commands using the Typer library.",
  "sources": "Input source is user-provided command-line arguments (name, formal).",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting greeting/farewell messages; no direct data leakage or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line arguments flow into functions and are outputted via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Typer CLI app.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the Typer module and defines a CLI app with two commands: hello and goodbye. Each command takes user inputs (name, formal) and outputs messages using print(). No external data sources, network communication, or system modifications are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code is minimal, clean, and focused on user interaction only.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard CLI application with no malicious behavior detected. It simply outputs greeting messages based on user input. No security issues or malware signs are identified.",
