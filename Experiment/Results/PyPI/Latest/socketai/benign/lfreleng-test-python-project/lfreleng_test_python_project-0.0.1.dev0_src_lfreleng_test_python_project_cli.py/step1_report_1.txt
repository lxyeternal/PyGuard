No external network calls, data storage, or other risky behavior is present. The code does not process or transmit data insecurely or include any hidden or obfuscated logic. It is a simple, standard CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI application with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for user interaction without any security concerns.",
