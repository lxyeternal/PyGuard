  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python CLI application using the Typer library.\n- It defines two commands: `hello` and `goodbye`.\n- User inputs (`name`, `formal`) are taken via CLI arguments.\n- The outputs are simple print statements with formatted strings.\n- No external network calls, file I/O, environment variable usage, or secrets are present.\n- The code is minimal, clean, and typical for such CLI tools.\n\n**2. Logical and Structural Review:**\n- The code does not contain any hidden, obfuscated, or suspicious constructs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- No data leaks or external data transmission.\n- No malicious or harmful logic detected.\n\n**3. Error, Flaw, or Mistake Identification:**\n- No errors or flaws are evident.\n- The logic is correct for its purpose.\n- The use of the Typer library is standard.\n- The code adheres to good practices for a simple CLI app.\n\n**4. Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- The confidence levels are 1.0 across reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**5. Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the code is benign based on static analysis and lack of suspicious patterns.\n- No runtime or dynamic analysis is provided, but given the simplicity, static analysis suffices.\n- The code does not process or handle data insecurely, nor does it perform any malicious actions.\n\n**6. Justification for Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely a CLI greeting app with no malicious or risky behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 or near-zero is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**7. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign classification.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
