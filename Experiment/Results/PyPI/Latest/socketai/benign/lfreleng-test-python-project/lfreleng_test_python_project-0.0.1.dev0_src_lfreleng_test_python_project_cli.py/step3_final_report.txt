  "purpose": "A simple CLI application using Typer with commands for greeting and farewell.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments 'name' and 'formal' used in command functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting formatted strings; no external data or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into print statements; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no external dependencies, no data leaks, no network activity, and no secrets. It performs simple string formatting and printing. Static analysis confirms the absence of malicious or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature. Slight overestimation of security risk (0.1) in one report is acceptable but could be standardized to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores are appropriate. Minor adjustments could be made to set the security risk score to 0 for consistency.",
