{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI application that provides greeting and farewell commands using the typer library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'formal' from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements; no data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> function parameters -> print output; no untrusted data processed beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The SPDX license comments are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper using the 'typer' library. It defines two commands, 'hello' and 'goodbye', each accepting a 'name' argument. The 'goodbye' command also accepts a 'formal' boolean flag. The functions perform simple string formatting and print statements for output. There are no external data reads other than command-line arguments, no network calls, no file I/O, and no use of environment variables or secrets. The code structure is clean, well-commented, and employs standard practices. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI application with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to output greetings based on user input, with no suspicious or harmful logic present.",
