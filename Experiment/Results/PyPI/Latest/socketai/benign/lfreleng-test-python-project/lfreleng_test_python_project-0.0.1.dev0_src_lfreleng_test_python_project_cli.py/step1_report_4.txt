  "purpose": "A simple command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for greeting functions using the typer library.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments (name, formal).",
  "sinks": "Output to the console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from command-line input to the functions and then to print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code. Usage of external library (typer) is standard for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the typer library to create a CLI with commands 'hello' and 'goodbye'. Both commands accept user input via command-line arguments. The inputs are used solely for formatting greeting strings and are printed to the console. No external data sources, environment variables, or network connections are involved. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic or anomalous behavior. No data leaks, credential handling, or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign CLI wrapper script that provides greeting functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is simple, clear, and safe.",
