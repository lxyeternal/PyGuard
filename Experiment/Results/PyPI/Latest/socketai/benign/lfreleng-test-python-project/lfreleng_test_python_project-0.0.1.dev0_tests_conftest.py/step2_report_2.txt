  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign test setup using pytest and Typer.\n- No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious constructs are mentioned.\n- The code is straightforward: importing testing libraries, defining a fixture that returns a `CliRunner` instance.\n- SPDX license identifiers are standard and not suspicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk score is 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original provided code snippet.\n- No issues are found in the logic, reasoning, or summary of each report.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential points of critique:**\n- Since all reports are uniform and accurate, there's no indication of overlooked issues.\n- The code is very minimal and typical for test setup; no further risk assessment is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard testing setup with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consistent findings across all reports.",
