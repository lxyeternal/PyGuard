  "purpose": "A minimal pytest fixture setup for testing CLI applications using Typer's CliRunner.",
  "sources": "Import of pytest and CliRunner from typer.testing; no external data or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a fixture returning a CliRunner instance.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign test fixture setup with no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious elements justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless testing fixture with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and justified, and no further action is necessary.",
