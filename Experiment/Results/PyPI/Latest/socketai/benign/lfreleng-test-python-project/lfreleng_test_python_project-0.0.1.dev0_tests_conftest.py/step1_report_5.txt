  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as code only imports modules and defines a fixture",
  "anomalies": "Use of SPDX license identifiers, which are standard and not suspicious; no unusual code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and defines a fixture to instantiate a CLI test runner. It lacks any input handling, network communication, or other potentially malicious activity. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for a test setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup for CLI applications using pytest and Typer. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
