      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores; Report 4 shows moderate suspicion justified by obfuscation and dynamic patterns. Subprocess issues in Report 5 warrant a slightly higher malware score (~0.2-0.3). Overall, the security risk is moderate (~0.4-0.55), with no definitive malicious payloads detected. The assessments are consistent and cautious, aligning with the evidence."
