  "purpose": "Expose and make accessible the BerriCake class from the berricake module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing BerriCake from a relative module berricake.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the BerriCake class, which could be used elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, which is standard practice in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The simplicity suggests it is a standard module export file. No suspicious or unusual code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to expose a class for external use. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
