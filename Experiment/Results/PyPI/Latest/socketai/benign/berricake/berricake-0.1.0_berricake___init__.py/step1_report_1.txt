  "purpose": "The code exports the BerriCake class for external use, indicating it is part of a package module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package directory importing BerriCake from berricake module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code constructs or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, then exports it via __all__. It appears to be a standard module export pattern. No malicious logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no sources or sinks of untrusted data, and no code execution, network activity, or data handling is visible.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a larger package, likely to expose the BerriCake class.",
