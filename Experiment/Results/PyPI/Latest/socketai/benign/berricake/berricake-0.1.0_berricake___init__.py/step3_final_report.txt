{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module export that exposes the BerriCake class from a local submodule.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .berricake import BerriCake",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only imports and exposes a class",
  "flows": "Import from .berricake to __all__ assignment; no data flow beyond module scope",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module pattern that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not process data, connect to networks, or handle secrets. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a benign assessment. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The code's purpose is solely to expose a class, and it does so in a standard manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export pattern with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and security risk at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
