  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports the BerriCake class from a local module and makes it available for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.berricake)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output, network operations, or external calls present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only performs an import and exports a class name",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and an export list. It only exposes a class BerriCake from a local module. There are no external data sources, no suspicious code execution, or security-sensitive operations. The simplicity indicates standard practice for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security issues. It merely imports and exposes a class. No malicious signals detected.",
