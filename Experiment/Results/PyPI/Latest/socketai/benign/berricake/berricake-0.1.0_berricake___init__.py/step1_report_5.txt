  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API of a Python module by importing and exposing the BerriCake class from a local submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.berricake' to import BerriCake.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The code imports BerriCake from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and minimal, with standard import and export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated logic. The structure is simple and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is a normal module import/export pattern.",
