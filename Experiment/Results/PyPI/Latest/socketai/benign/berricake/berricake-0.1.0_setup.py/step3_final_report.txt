  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package 'berricake' with Cython extensions, involving reading README, defining metadata, compiling modules, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, package metadata variables, and Cython source files (.pyx).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; only local file reads and compilation commands.",
  "flows": "Reads local files (README.md, source files), compiles Cython modules; no external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script using setuptools and Cython. It performs no runtime data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The use of standard modules and practices indicates a benign package configuration. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The dependencies and build steps are common for scientific Python packages with Cython extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a legitimate, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as standard and safe. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0, consistent with the code's content.",
