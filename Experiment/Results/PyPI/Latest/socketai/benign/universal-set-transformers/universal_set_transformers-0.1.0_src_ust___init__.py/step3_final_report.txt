  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'universal-set-transformers' package using standard library functions.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() called with the package name",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__ variable; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() -> Sink: __version__ variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of a specific package, assigning it to __version__. It involves no external inputs, network activity, or malicious constructs. The code is minimal, clear, and uses standard library functions for benign purposes. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the simplicity and transparency, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe snippet for obtaining package version information. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
