  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'universal-set-transformers' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "The code calls importlib.metadata.version() to obtain version info, assigning it to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library to get package version",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to access package metadata. It then retrieves the version of the 'universal-set-transformers' package. The code is minimal and standard for version retrieval, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent observed. It does not process user input, access external resources beyond package metadata, or contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate retrieval of package version information with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
