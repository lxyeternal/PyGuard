  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call, which reads package metadata",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no untrusted data outputs or external effects",
  "flows": "The code reads package metadata and assigns it to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard for version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata, a standard library module, and uses it to get the version of a specific package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, intended solely for version retrieval. No inputs, outputs, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign action to fetch package version information. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
