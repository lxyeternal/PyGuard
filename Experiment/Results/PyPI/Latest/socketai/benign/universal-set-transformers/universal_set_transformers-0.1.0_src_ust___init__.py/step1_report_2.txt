  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'universal-set-transformers' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version call with the package name as a string",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data; only reads package metadata",
  "flows": "Imports version info of a package, assigns to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward metadata access",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module and uses it to obtain the version of a specific package, storing it in __version__. There are no user inputs, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The operation appears limited to static metadata retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of retrieving package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
