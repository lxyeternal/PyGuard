  "purpose": "Define type aliases and a sentinel object for handling minibatches in a machine learning context, specifically with PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'typing' module, and conditional import of 'torch' for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly establishes type aliases and a sentinel object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is standard for type annotations and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for minibatch processing, including dictionaries and iterables, as well as a function type for transformations. It conditionally imports 'torch' for type hints, which is a common pattern to avoid runtime dependencies during type checking. The sentinel object 'NoState' is a simple object used to represent the absence of state, which is typical in stateful operations. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and safe, mainly serving as type annotations for a larger ML codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup for handling minibatch data in machine learning workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
