{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for minibatches, a transformation function, and a sentinel object for ML workflows with conditional torch import.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of torch within TYPE_CHECKING; type alias definitions; sentinel object NoState.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static type annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; type aliases and import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for minibatch processing, a conditional import of torch for type checking, and a sentinel object for indicating no state. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard, and the code serves purely for static type annotations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of security risks or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for type annotations in a Python ML project, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with scores of 0.0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which are appropriate.",
