{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and a sentinel object for handling minibatches in a machine learning context, specifically with PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, conditional import of torch for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; code is primarily type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no execution flow that processes data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The import guarded by TYPE_CHECKING indicates awareness of optional runtime dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for minibatch representations and transformations, relying on type hints and a conditional import for torch. There are no executable statements, no data processing, and no malicious code patterns. The use of TYPE_CHECKING ensures torch is only imported during static type checking, which is standard practice. Overall, this code is a typical setup for type safety and clarity in a larger ML project.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward type definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for clearer code documentation and type checking in a PyTorch-based project.",
