{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and a sentinel object for processing minibatches in a machine learning context, specifically for a project that optionally integrates with PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Type hints and the import of torch within a TYPE_CHECKING block, which is used for static analysis but not runtime.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for optional import is standard; no suspicious or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for minibatch processing, including optional torch tensors, and defines a sentinel object. It uses standard typing imports and a conditional import for type checking, which is a common pattern. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to serve as part of a larger ML project infrastructure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup for type annotations and constants in a Python ML project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
