  "purpose": "Define type aliases and sentinel object for handling minibatches in a machine learning context, with conditional import for torch.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', conditional import of 'torch' within TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only type annotations and a sentinel object are defined",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily type definitions and annotations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for minibatches and a transform function, conditional import of 'torch' for type checking, and defines a sentinel object. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to sinks. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard setup for type annotations in a machine learning pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focused solely on type annotations and structural definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
