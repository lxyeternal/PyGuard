  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type aliases and a sentinel object, with conditional import of torch, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this code is benign, primarily for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues found; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on ML workflows, no data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is purely for type annotations and constants.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard pattern with conditional import, type aliases, and sentinel object.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical setup for type safety.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard type annotations, conditional import, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no security issues or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, no data flow or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is safe and serves as type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only for type annotations, type aliases, and a sentinel object.\n- **Malware, Obfuscation, Risks:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Consistency:** The scores and assessments are consistent across reports.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, safe setup for type annotations in a Python ML project, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects the code's harmless, purely structural purpose in a larger codebase.",
