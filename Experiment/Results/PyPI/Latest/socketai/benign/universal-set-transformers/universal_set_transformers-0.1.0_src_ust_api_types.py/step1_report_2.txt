{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and a sentinel object for handling minibatches in a tensor processing context, likely for machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only type annotations and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares types and a sentinel object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. Use of TYPE_CHECKING and type annotations is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules, conditionally imports torch for type checking, and defines type aliases for minibatch data structures used in ML workflows. The sentinel object NoState is a common pattern for indicating absence of state. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, no data processing, and no apparent security issues. The code is straightforward and solely for type annotations and definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type aliases and a sentinel object for a machine learning pipeline. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
