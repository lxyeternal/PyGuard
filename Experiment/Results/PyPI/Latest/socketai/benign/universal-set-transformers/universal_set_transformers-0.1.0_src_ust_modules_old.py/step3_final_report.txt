{
  "purpose": "Implementation of advanced attention mechanisms and transformer modules for neural network models, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs, linear layers, attention modules, internal parameters; no external data sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network communication, or data exfiltration; data flow remains within tensor operations.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through linear projections, attention computations, and residual connections within the module functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard PyTorch modules implementing scaled dot product attention, slot attention, and multi-head attention, all aligned with common deep learning practices. No external I/O, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses typical tensor operations without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of attention mechanisms with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and no malicious activity is evident. Scores are set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
