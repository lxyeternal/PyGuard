{
  "purpose": "Defines a function 'pipe' that applies a callable to either a torch.Tensor or a collection of Minibatches, with type overloads for different input types.",
  "sources": "Imports 'torch', type annotations, and functions/types from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data (torch.Tensor or Minibatches) flows into 'immediate_call' or 'minibatch_call', but these are function parameters, not direct data flows. No external data sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be standard data processing logic with type annotations and functional application.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'pipe' function with multiple overloads to handle different input types, using type hints for clarity. It conditionally applies 'immediate_call' if the input is a tensor, or maps 'minibatch_call' over a collection. The code structure and usage are typical for data processing pipelines, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing utility for applying functions to tensors or minibatch collections. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code snippet.",
