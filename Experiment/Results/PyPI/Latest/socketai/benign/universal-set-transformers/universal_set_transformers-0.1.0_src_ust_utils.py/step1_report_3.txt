{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'pipe' function for processing either a single torch.Tensor or a collection of Minibatches using specified callback functions, facilitating flexible data processing pipelines.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters: tensor_or_minibatches, immediate_call, and minibatch_call.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external systems; the code only applies functions to inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the inputs (tensor or minibatches) through the type checks and then into either immediate_call or map with minibatch_call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features. The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a generic 'pipe' function with type annotations and overloads for different input types. It performs type checking to decide whether to process a single tensor with immediate_call or to process a collection of minibatches with map and minibatch_call. There are no external system calls, no data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code is typical for data processing pipelines in machine learning workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing utility for tensor and minibatch workflows. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
