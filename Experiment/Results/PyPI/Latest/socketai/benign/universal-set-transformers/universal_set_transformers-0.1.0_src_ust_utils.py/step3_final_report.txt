{
  "purpose": "A utility function 'pipe' that applies a callable to either a torch.Tensor or an iterable of Minibatches, with type overloads for clarity.",
  "sources": "Input data from either a torch.Tensor or Minibatches collection.",
  "sinks": "Application of external functions ('immediate_call' or 'minibatch_call') which could process data or perform external actions, but no direct data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (tensor or minibatches) through the type check, then either directly via 'immediate_call' or mapped through 'minibatch_call' over the collection.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type-checked application of functions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'pipe' function with overloads for different input types, performing runtime type checking to apply a function directly or map it over a collection. No network, system, or malicious code is present. The functions passed are external and could be malicious if crafted so, but the utility code itself is safe. The code is simple, clear, and standard for data pipelines. No signs of obfuscation, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing tensors or minibatches. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The potential security concern depends on the external functions passed in, not the utility itself. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) reflecting reliance on external functions.",
