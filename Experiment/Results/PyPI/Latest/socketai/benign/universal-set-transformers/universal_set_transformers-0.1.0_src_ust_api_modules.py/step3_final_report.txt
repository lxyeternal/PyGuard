  "purpose": "Framework for set attention, encoder, and pooling layers in neural networks, designed for set-based data processing with support for minibatch and stateful operations.",
  "sources": "Tensor inputs for queries, keys, values, and optional multiplicities; internal state management during minibatch processing.",
  "sinks": "Internal tensor computations; no external data transfer, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through attention and pooling computations, possibly across minibatches with internal state updates.",
  "anomalies": "Warnings about minibatch consistency, which are typical implementation notes; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes for attention, encoder, and pooling layers, using standard Python and PyTorch constructs. No external communication, embedded malicious code, or obfuscation is present. Warnings are benign and relate to implementation limitations. The code processes tensors and minibatches internally without external data leaks or network activity. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the code's structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured framework for set attention and pooling layers, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The minor security risk score reflects potential misuse of tensor inputs but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
