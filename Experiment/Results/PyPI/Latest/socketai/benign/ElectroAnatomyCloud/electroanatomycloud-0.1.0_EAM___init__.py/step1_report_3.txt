{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initializer that exports specific submodules: display, register, and graph.",
  "sources": "The code imports submodules from the current package: display, register, and graph.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ list to specify public API components. It then imports three submodules from the current package. No data input, output, or processing occurs here. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, and the code structure is typical for Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely exposes certain submodules for external use.",
