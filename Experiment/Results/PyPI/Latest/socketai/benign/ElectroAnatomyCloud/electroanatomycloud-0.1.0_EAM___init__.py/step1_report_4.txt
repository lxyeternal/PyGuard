{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to define and expose a public API consisting of 'display', 'register', and 'graph' modules by importing them from the current package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module namespace and the list __all__ to define exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted data; the flow is limited to module imports and assignment to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an explicit list of publicly available modules and imports three local modules: display, register, and graph. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain any dynamic execution. The structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files, setting up package exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file, merely exporting modules without any malicious or suspicious activity. It presents no security risks based on this segment.",
