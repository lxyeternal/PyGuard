  "purpose": "Module initializer setting __all__ and importing submodules display, register, and graph.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: display, register, graph",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only",
  "flows": "Import statements establish source-to-sink flow within local modules; no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no dynamic or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ for module exports and imports three local submodules. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior. The structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. All reports confirm the benign nature, assigning maximum confidence (1) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support the conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All evidence and reports support this assessment, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
