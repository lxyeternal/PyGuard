  "purpose": "Defines a module with explicit exports for display, register, and graph functionalities by importing submodules.",
  "sources": "Imports of display, register, and graph submodules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only sets up module exports without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares an explicit list of exported modules and imports these modules from the current package. It does not contain any data processing, external data input, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package __all__ declarations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module export setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
