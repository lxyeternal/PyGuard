  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization file that imports three submodules: display, register, and graph.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code imports submodules, but there are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python __init__.py file for a package, defining the public API via __all__ and importing submodules. It does not include any data processing, network activity, or code execution. The structure is standard and lacks any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely exports and imports package components.",
