{
  "purpose": "The code processes 3D medical imaging data, including point clouds, meshes, and voltage XML files, for visualization, clustering, and geometric transformations.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations reading mesh files, XML voltage data, and image data; data loading functions such as load_mesh_data() and load_voltage_data_from_xml().",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions (plot_shell_point_cloud, plot_meshes_3d, etc.), in-memory data structures; no network or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading functions into in-memory structures (numpy arrays, lists), then through processing steps like clustering, transformations, and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for medical imaging and mesh processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for handling medical imaging data, including loading mesh and voltage data, clustering points with KMeans, applying geometric transformations, and visualization. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling is present. The functions are straightforward, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk, primarily due to handling sensitive data but without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific tool for processing and visualizing medical imaging and mesh data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
