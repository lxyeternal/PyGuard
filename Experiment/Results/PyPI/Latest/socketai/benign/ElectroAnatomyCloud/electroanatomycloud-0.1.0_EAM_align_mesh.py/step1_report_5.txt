{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform mesh and image alignment for cardiac imaging data, including loading mesh and segmentation files, applying transformations, clustering, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments, including file paths, transformation parameters, and options for clustering and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous functions include sys.exit(), print(), and file writing via sitk.WriteImage, but these are standard and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed, used to load data, apply transformations, optionally cluster data, and save output images.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Use of ast.literal_eval for parsing euler transform is safe and controlled. No evident obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical command-line tool for image and mesh processing in medical imaging. It uses standard libraries (argparse, sys, SimpleITK) and custom modules (display, register, graph) assumed to be for visualization and registration tasks. The code reads input files, performs geometric transformations, and saves results. No network operations, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are present. All data handling appears typical for such applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate medical image processing tool with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard data loading, transformation, and visualization tasks without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
