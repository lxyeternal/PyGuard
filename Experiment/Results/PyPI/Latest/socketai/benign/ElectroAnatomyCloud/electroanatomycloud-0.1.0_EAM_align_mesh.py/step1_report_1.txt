{
  "purpose": "This script aligns mesh and imaging data for cardiac electroanatomy and CT imaging, performing transformations, segmentation, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line arguments, including file paths and user-specified transformation data.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations for image and mesh data; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs (file paths and transformation parameters) flow into data loading, processing, and optional visualization/output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ast.literal_eval on command-line input without strict validation; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected; no code injection points observed.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts user input via command-line arguments, parses and validates transformation parameters, loads mesh and segmentation data, performs registration and alignment transformations, and optionally visualizes and saves the result. No dynamic code execution beyond safe evaluation with ast.literal_eval is present. The transformations and file operations are standard for image processing workflows. The use of external libraries (SimpleITK, custom modules) does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The only minor concern is the use of literal_eval for parsing the Euler transform, but it is controlled and validated to expect a tuple of three numbers.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate image registration and visualization tool with no indications of malicious behavior. It performs standard data processing operations, and no suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
