{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for visualizing 3D point clouds, meshes, and volumetric data using Plotly, as well as converting SimpleITK images into 3D meshes for visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from numpy arrays, SimpleITK images, and external libraries such as skimage, trimesh, and sklearn for data processing and visualization.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to plotting functions (Plotly) which display visualizations; no data is sent over network or written to disk within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input data (points, labels, images, voltage data) flows into visualization functions; there are no external or untrusted data flows directed outside the environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code predominantly uses standard libraries for visualization and image processing; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements visualization functions using established libraries for 3D plotting and image processing. All data inputs are used for rendering visual outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or system manipulation. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code does depend on external libraries, but usage appears standard and safe. No malicious payloads or unauthorized actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of visualization utilities for 3D point clouds, meshes, and volumetric data. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
