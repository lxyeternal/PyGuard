{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing 3D point clouds, volume meshes, and voltage data in medical imaging and point cloud analysis using Plotly, matplotlib, and SimpleITK.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, SimpleITK images, and mesh objects; accesses image spacing, origin, and direction; reads voltage mappings from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform untrusted data writing, network communication, or system modifications; primarily generate visualizations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (arrays, images, dictionaries) into visualization functions; no external untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of standard libraries and functions for image processing and plotting. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively utilizes well-known scientific and visualization libraries (numpy, skimage, trimesh, SimpleITK, plotly, matplotlib). It processes input data for visualization purposes, converting images to meshes and plotting various 3D data structures. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The functions operate on trusted data and perform standard visualization tasks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of visualization functions for medical imaging and point cloud analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
