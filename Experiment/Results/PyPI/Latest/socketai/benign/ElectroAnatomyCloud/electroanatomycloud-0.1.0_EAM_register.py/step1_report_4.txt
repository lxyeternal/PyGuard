{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform 3D mesh processing, registration, segmentation extraction, and visualization in a medical imaging context, likely for cardiac imaging analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads mesh data from a file, loads medical image data (NIfTI) from disk, and extracts label masks from images.",
  "sinks": "Uses the extracted data for mesh registration, point cloud processing, and visualization. No direct data leakage or untrusted data handling beyond typical file I/O.",
  "flows": "Reads mesh and image data → processes and aligns meshes and point clouds → potentially visualizes or saves results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments identified. No obfuscated code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O, mesh and image processing, registration algorithms, clustering, and visualization. All operations are consistent with typical medical imaging workflows. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system modifications. Usage of libraries like SimpleITK, numpy, scikit-learn, and trimesh aligns with standard practices. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden functions are present. The code structure and comments suggest intended scientific or clinical use rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and typical medical imaging processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard operations for mesh and image registration, segmentation, clustering, and visualization, without any suspicious or harmful components.",
