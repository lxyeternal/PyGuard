{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to start the 'tablestore-mcp-server', parsing command-line arguments for transport method and delegating server startup to an external module.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--transport' and environment variables (implied, not explicitly accessed).",
  "sinks": "The external 'mcp.run()' function, which could process the 'transport' parameter and potentially handle untrusted data internally.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line args flows into 'mcp.run(transport=args.transport)', delegating control to the external module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and relies on an external module for core functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal server launcher that parses a '--transport' argument, logs the startup message, and calls an external 'mcp' module's run method. It does not perform any malicious activity, contain obfuscation, or handle sensitive data directly. The security posture depends on the external 'mcp' module, which is outside this code's scope. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily hinging on the trustworthiness of the external 'mcp' module. Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws.",
