{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and runs a server component called 'tablestore-mcp-server' with configurable transport options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; Environment variables (implied by comment, but not explicitly accessed in code); Module import from tablestore_mcp_server.server.",
  "sinks": "Calling mcp.run() with the transport argument; logging output.",
  "flows": "User provides --transport argument -> argparse parses argument -> mcp.run(transport=args.transport) is called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; environment variables are mentioned but not accessed; the actual server logic is imported from an external module.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard command-line argument parsing, logs a message indicating server start, and invokes an external module's run method with the specified transport mode. No user input beyond command-line args is processed, and no data is transmitted or manipulated directly within this script. The reliance on an external module ('tablestore_mcp_server.server') means any malicious behavior could reside there, but within this code snippet, no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a server launcher script.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign server startup script, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise within the provided snippet. It relies on external modules for core functionality, which are not analyzed here.",
