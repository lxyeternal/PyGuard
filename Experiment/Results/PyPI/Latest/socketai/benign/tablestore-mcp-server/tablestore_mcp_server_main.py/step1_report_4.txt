{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a server named 'tablestore-mcp-server' with configurable transport options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (parsed via argparse) and environment variables (implied but not explicitly used in the code).",
  "sinks": "Calling mcp.run() function with the transport parameter, which may affect server behavior.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argparse parsing -> logging -> mcp.run() with transport parameter",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code only sets up logging, argument parsing, and imports a server module.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward command-line interface to start a server with configurable transport options. It relies on an external module 'tablestore_mcp_server.server.mcp' for core functionality. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of environment variables is mentioned but not implemented in the provided snippet. The code appears to be standard server initialization code, with no obfuscated elements or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign server startup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles argument parsing and delegates the core operation to an external module. No malicious intent or security issues are evident based on this snippet.",
