  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script sets up a command-line interface to start a server called 'tablestore-mcp-server'.\n- It uses argparse to parse a '--transport' argument with options 'stdio' and 'sse' (default 'sse').\n- It logs the chosen transport method.\n- It imports 'mcp' from 'tablestore_mcp_server.server' and calls 'mcp.run(transport=args.transport)'.\n- The code relies on environment variables for configuration, but does not explicitly read them.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n- The actual server logic resides in the external 'mcp' module, which is not shown.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code's flow is simple: parse args, log, delegate to external module.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No coding errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The mention of environment variables suggests configuration, but they are not explicitly accessed here; this is not a flaw but a design note.\n- No issues with the code's logic or structure.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0. The code itself does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2. Given that the core functionality depends on an external module, if that module is malicious, the risk could be higher. But based solely on this code, the risk is minimal.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The actual security implications depend heavily on the imported 'mcp' module, which is outside this code snippet.\n- If 'mcp.run()' is malicious or insecure, that would be a concern, but we cannot assess that here.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, assuming the external module is trustworthy)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis code is a typical server startup script with no inherent security issues. The security risk hinges on the external 'mcp' module, which should be reviewed separately.\n\n**Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity or security risk within this code snippet. The minimal risk score reflects reliance on external modules, which should be verified for security.",
