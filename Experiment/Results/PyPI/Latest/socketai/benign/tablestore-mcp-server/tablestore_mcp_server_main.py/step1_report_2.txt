{
  "purpose": "Configure and run the tablestore-mcp-server with command-line arguments and environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--transport), environment variables (implied by comment, but not explicitly read in code), imported module 'tablestore_mcp_server.server.mcp'",
  "sinks": "mcp.run() method which starts the server based on provided transport option",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> mcp.run() method; environment variables influence configuration but are not explicitly shown in code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code operations observed; minimal logic, straightforward usage",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging, parses a command-line argument '--transport' with choices 'stdio' or 'sse' and a default of 'sse'. It then imports the 'mcp' object from a server module and calls its run method with the specified transport. The code relies on environment variables for configuration, but does not explicitly read or handle them. No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no evident data leaks or system manipulations. The code appears to be a simple entry point for a server application, delegating core logic to the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard script to start a server with configurable transport options. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a benign, straightforward configuration and execution script with no security risks identified in this snippet.",
