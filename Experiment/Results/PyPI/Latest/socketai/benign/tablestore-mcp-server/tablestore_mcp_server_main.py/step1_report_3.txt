{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and runs a server component called 'tablestore-mcp-server' with configurable transport options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--transport) and environment variables (implied by comment, but not explicitly read in the code).",
  "sinks": "The mcp.run() function call, which potentially handles network operations or data processing based on the transport mode.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing -> logging message -> calling mcp.run() with transport parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The comment about environment variables suggests configuration via environment, but these are not explicitly used or processed in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up argument parsing with two transport options ('stdio' and 'sse') and logs the selected mode. It then imports a server module and runs its 'run' method with the chosen transport. No user input is directly read beyond command-line arguments. The call to mcp.run() is a typical server start-up procedure, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are observed. The comment indicates reliance on environment variables for configuration, but this code does not show such variables being accessed, which is benign. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward server initialization script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple server launcher script that configures and starts a server component based on command-line parameters. It does not contain any malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
