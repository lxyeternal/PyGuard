  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review and Issue Confirmation:**  \n- The code is a straightforward server startup script that parses a command-line argument `--transport` (choices: \"stdio\" or \"sse\", default \"sse\").  \n- It logs the startup message and calls `mcp.run()` with the selected transport.  \n- The `mcp` object is imported from an external module (`tablestore_mcp_server.server`).  \n- The code mentions environment variables for configuration but does not explicitly read or process them here.  \n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.  \n- The overall structure is typical for a server entry point.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No issues are present in this code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning:**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple server launcher, with no malicious code within this snippet.  \n- They acknowledge that core logic is delegated to an external module (`mcp.run()`), which could contain vulnerabilities or malicious code, but that is outside the scope of this review.  \n- The reports consistently note the mention of environment variables without explicit usage, which is accurate.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.  \n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9-1), appropriate for the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n- Since the code itself shows no malicious activity, and the external module's behavior is unknown, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.  \n- The current scores are reasonable, reflecting low risk and no malware.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**  \n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code snippet.  \n- If the external module (`mcp`) contained malicious code, that would not be reflected here unless additional context was provided.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only note the potential for issues within the external module, which is appropriate.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- All scores are consistent with the code's analysis and the cautious approach of not assuming external module behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- Given the code alone: **0**  \n- If external module behavior is unknown: remain **0** (since no evidence here).\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- Clearly not obfuscated: **0**\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Based on the code: **0** (benign)  \n- Considering the external module could introduce risk, but without evidence, the overall risk remains low: **0.2** or less.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                           |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious code in this snippet; external module unknown but unassessed here. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is straightforward and clear.                      |\n| Risk            | 0.1 - 0.2         | Low risk; primarily depends on external module which is not analyzed here. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe provided code appears to be a standard, benign server launcher. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident within this snippet. The assessments and scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with this conclusion.",
