  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Parses a command-line argument `--transport` with choices `stdio` and `sse`, defaulting to `sse`.\n- Logs the selected transport.\n- Imports `mcp` from `tablestore_mcp_server.server`.\n- Calls `mcp.run(transport=args.transport)`.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code is a straightforward entry point for a server application.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No dynamic code execution or data leaks.\n- The reliance on an external module (`mcp`) means potential issues could originate there, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.\n- Environment variables are mentioned but not explicitly accessed or manipulated here, which is benign.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude that the code is standard, benign, and lacks malicious or suspicious behavior. They correctly note the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. They also acknowledge that core logic resides in an external module, which isn't analyzed here.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- Since the actual server logic is in an external module, any malicious behavior could be hidden there. However, based solely on this script, there's no evidence of such.\n- The mention of environment variables suggests configuration flexibility, but their absence in this snippet reduces concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical server startup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on this review.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the minimal code and external dependencies)\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet, with any real risk depending on the external module's implementation.",
