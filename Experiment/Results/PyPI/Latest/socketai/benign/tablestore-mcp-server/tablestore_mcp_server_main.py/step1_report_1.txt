{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a server called 'tablestore-mcp-server' with configurable transport options via command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed through argparse; imported 'mcp' from 'tablestore_mcp_server.server' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run' function, which executes with the 'transport' parameter, potentially influences server behavior, but details depend on the imported module.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (args.transport) flows into 'mcp.run' function as a parameter; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of environment variables is mentioned but not explicitly shown, and the code relies on external modules.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles argument parsing and logging before invoking an external 'mcp.run' function with the specified transport method. No unsafe or malicious code constructs are present. The import is from a local module, and the code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or obfuscated logic. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a server startup script. Since the actual behavior depends on the 'mcp' module, which is not shown, the security assessment cannot definitively rule out issues within that module. However, based solely on this code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server startup script with command-line configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment. Any security concerns would depend on the implementation of the imported 'mcp' module, which is outside the scope of this review.",
