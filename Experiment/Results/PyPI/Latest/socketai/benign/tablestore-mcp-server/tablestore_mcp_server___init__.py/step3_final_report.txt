  "purpose": "Analyze the code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious constructs.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external modules, network communication points, dynamic code execution (eval).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, subprocess calls, dynamic eval execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval(), network functions, or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on untrusted data, network activity to suspicious domains, obfuscation tactics, dynamic imports, complex eval patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1-4, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores reflect low risk and malware likelihood, with high confidence. Report 5 shows significant suspicious behavior: eval() on untrusted input, network activity, and obfuscation tactics, indicating moderate to high malicious potential. The scores for report 5 (malware=0.5, obfuscated=0.4, securityRisk=0.6) are justified, but considering the severity, slightly increasing malware to 0.55 and risk to 0.65 would better reflect the threat level.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5 demonstrates suspicious behaviors warranting elevated scores; minor score adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the code behaviors, with the exception of report 5, which should be flagged for further analysis due to eval() and network activity.",
