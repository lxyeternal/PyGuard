  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module, potentially intended for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, function parameters, or standard input streams (if present).",
  "sinks": "File writing operations, network communications, or database interactions (if present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like files, networks, or databases, through various processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows are detected in the provided code snippet. Lack of comments or documentation could be noted but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common malicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, use of unsafe functions, or backdoors. No malicious functions or behaviors, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data theft, or unauthorized system modifications, are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no obfuscation techniques or hidden behaviors are detected. Given the absence of suspicious signals, the code appears benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a normal Python script or module with no suspicious activities detected. However, the review is limited to the provided code snippet and does not include external context or runtime behavior.",
