{
  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, including dynamic features, obfuscation indicators, and behavioral patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows leading to network transmission, file access, or environment variable usage that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "From source points such as input reading or dynamic code execution to sinks like network connections, file modifications, or environment variable access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow structures suggestive of concealment or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across most reports, with low malware scores (0 to 0.2), minimal obfuscation, and low to moderate risk scores (0.2 to 0.4). No concrete malicious activity or backdoors are identified. Obfuscation and complexity are noted but not indicative of malicious intent. Confidence levels are generally high (0.6 to 0.8), reflecting the limited code context but consistent assessments. The scores align well with the descriptions, and no significant anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows minimal to low suspicion of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided analyses. No immediate security threats are evident, though ongoing monitoring of obfuscated or complex code is advisable.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
