{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for server, tools, embedding provider, and Tablestore for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Configuration fields reading environment variables via pydantic BaseSettings; default string constants.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the environment variables (via pydantic BaseSettings) which could be manipulated externally; no direct data sinks or network actions present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) feed into configuration objects; no data flows to external systems or insecure handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (except defaults which are placeholders), or suspicious logic; straightforward configuration classes.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes configuration models with default values and environment variable bindings using pydantic. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no network connections, and no cryptic obfuscation or backdoors are present. The configuration parameters seem standard for a server setup with external dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines configuration models for application settings using pydantic. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or insecure operations. All variables are handled via environment variables with defaults, which is standard practice. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
