  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for a server, tools, embedding provider, and Tablestore integration using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via Pydantic's BaseSettings and default string constants for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data output points; configurations are set via environment variables or defaults.",
  "flows": "Environment variables feed into configuration objects, used within the application for connecting to external services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; use of Pydantic for configuration management is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secret leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration data models with environment variable support. No input/output operations, no external data processing, no suspicious logic. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. Constants are benign descriptive strings. Use of Optional fields for sensitive credentials is appropriate. Overall structure aligns with standard practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It primarily manages settings via environment variables and defaults.",
