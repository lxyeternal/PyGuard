{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes and default descriptions for a server, tools, embedding provider, and Tablestore integration in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Configuration fields initialized with default values and environment variable aliases; import statements for modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input directly, such as network operations, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are assigned at class initialization, primarily from environment variables or defaults, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information directly present; no unusual or suspicious code patterns or obfuscation; code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes using pydantic's BaseSettings, which pulls configuration from environment variables or defaults. The default descriptions are static strings. No user input is directly processed or used unsafely. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration module without malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes environment variables for configuration management and includes no code that could be exploited for supply chain attacks or malware.",
