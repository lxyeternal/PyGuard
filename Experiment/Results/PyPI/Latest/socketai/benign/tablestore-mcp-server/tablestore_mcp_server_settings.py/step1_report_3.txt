{
  "purpose": "Define configuration classes and default descriptions for a server and tools related to Tablestore integration, embedding provider, and server settings.",
  "sources": "Configuration fields reading environment variables via pydantic settings, default string descriptions, import statements for types and classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., access keys), but only read during class instantiation; no data leakage or unsafe operations directly visible.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) are read during object instantiation and assigned to class attributes; no untrusted data flow or external command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets are absent; access keys and secrets are optional and expected to be supplied via environment variables, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configuration classes using pydantic's BaseSettings to load parameters from environment variables. Default descriptions are plain strings. The fields for sensitive data such as access keys are optional and are expected to be supplied securely via environment variables. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code, is present. Usage of environment variables aligns with best practices for secret management. The code structure is clear and straightforward, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a server, tools, embedding provider, and Tablestore settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of environment variables for sensitive data is appropriate. Overall, this is benign configuration code with no security concerns.",
