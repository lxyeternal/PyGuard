  "purpose": "Define configuration data models for server, tool, embedding provider, and Tablestore settings using Pydantic's BaseSettings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration values such as host, port, descriptions, provider type, model name, and Tablestore credentials.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; configuration data is stored in variables and environment variables. No direct data leak or malicious sink is evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) feed into class fields which are used to configure server and service behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. Default descriptions are benign and meant for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with defaults and environment variable mappings, primarily for configuration purposes. No data processing, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. All imported libraries are standard or well-known, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward configuration definitions without any malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice.",
