  "purpose": "Configuration classes for server, tool, embedding provider, and Tablestore settings using pydantic's BaseSettings, with environment variable bindings and defaults.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., access keys, endpoints), default values for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network calls or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during class initialization; no dynamic or external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, declarative configuration with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static configuration classes leveraging pydantic's environment variable support. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. Sensitive information is managed via environment variables, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets are present beyond placeholders. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0–0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable usage is typical and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.",
