  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a connector for storing/searching embeddings in Tablestore; inputs are content, metadata, and external connection parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from input through embedding, storage, and retrieval.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; credentials are passed as parameters, not hardcoded.\n- **Analysis:** Standard connection setup, embedding validation, and storage logic. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation. No malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure handling, validation, and standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on credential handling, embedding, and querying logic.\n- No signs of malicious activity; credentials are parameters, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights standard embedding, storage, and search flow.\n- No suspicious code, secrets are passed as parameters, logging is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizing validation, standard API usage, and no malicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code appears standard and secure.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None detected; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis; no overestimation or underestimation.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal, primarily due to handling of sensitive credentials and logging practices, but nothing malicious)\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the handling and logging of sensitive credentials, which should be managed carefully outside of logs, but this does not constitute a malware or high-risk issue.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured vector store connector with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the absence of any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
