  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward enum definition with a single member 'HUGGING_FACE'.\n- No external data, input, or network operations are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The purpose is clearly to define a constant for an embedding provider type.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code matches the described purpose: defining an enum with one member.\n- There are no errors, flaws, or malicious code present.\n- The code is simple, static, and benign.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (fully confident the code is benign)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - malware: 0 (no malware)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is benign, there's no reason to adjust scores.\n- The malware score is correctly zero; no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is correctly zero; no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward enum definition.\n- The reported scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores reflect the actual security posture correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as benign.",
