  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for embedding provider types, specifically 'hugging_face'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class declaration and the enumeration value assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a static enum definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple enumeration class with a single member. It uses the standard 'enum' module. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. The code is concise, clear, and does not perform any operations beyond defining a constant.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for defining an enumeration type. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
