  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for embedding provider types, specifically 'hugging_face'.",
  "sources": "Static code defining a class and a single enum member; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static enum definition with no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum with a single, static member, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enum class with one member 'HUGGING_FACE'. It contains no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is to define a constant for embedding provider type. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward enum definition with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
