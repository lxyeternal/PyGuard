{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for embedding provider types, specifically 'hugging_face'.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since there are no input or data processing operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for defining an Enum.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a single enumeration 'EmbeddingProviderType' with one member 'HUGGING_FACE'. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no data flows, and no malicious constructs present. The code appears to serve a simple configuration purpose without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of an enumeration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
