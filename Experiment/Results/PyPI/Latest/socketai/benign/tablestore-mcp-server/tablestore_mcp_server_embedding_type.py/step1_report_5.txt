  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different embedding provider types, currently only including 'hugging_face'.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward enum definition with no unusual features, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum, defines a class EmbeddingProviderType inheriting from Enum, with a single member HUGGING_FACE set to 'hugging_face'. No input handling, external network calls, or data processing is present. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
