The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal operational concerns. The minor parameter naming inconsistency should be corrected for operational robustness but does not impact security."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Its design and behavior pose minimal security risks, primarily related to external API interactions, which are properly validated and rate-limited. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The code is a typical entry point, and the scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The minor risk scores assigned in some reports are overstated; they should be adjusted to 0 given the evidence."
