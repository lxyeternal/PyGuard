{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local server module, then exits with its return code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statement of the server module and the execution of main().",
  "sinks": "The main() function could potentially perform actions such as network communication or system modifications, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing main() to executing sys.exit(main()), passing control to the server module's main function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this straightforward script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python entry point, importing a main function and executing it. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are visible. The security risk depends on the implementation of server.main(), which is external and unknown. The code itself is benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score should be minimal, reflecting the lack of suspicious activity in this snippet. Confidence in benign assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The code is a typical entry point, and the scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The minor risk scores assigned in some reports are overstated; they should be adjusted to 0 given the evidence.",
