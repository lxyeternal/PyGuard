  "flows": "Import sys -> call main() -> sys.exit() with main()'s output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and execution pattern, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module, then imports a main function from a local server module. It then calls main() and exits with its return value. This is typical for a command-line or script entry point. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard for launching a server or application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard script entry point that executes a main function from a local module and terminates. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
