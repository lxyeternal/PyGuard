{
  "purpose": "This code imports the main function from a local server module and executes it, then exits the program with its return value.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the system module (sys), specifically the sys.exit() function. It also imports and executes the main() function from the local server module.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is sys.exit(), which terminates the program with the result of main(). If main() performs network or system operations, they could be triggered indirectly.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing sys and local server, executing main(), and passing its return value to sys.exit().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent anomalies. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports the main function from a local server module and executes it, terminating the process with the main() function's return value. Without the implementation of server.main(), it's impossible to determine if malicious actions occur. The structure is typical for a Python entry point script, and no suspicious code patterns, data leaks, or malicious payloads are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks. The code functions as a straightforward script runner, delegating core logic to the server module. Without additional context, it appears benign.",
