{
  "purpose": "The code imports the main function from a local server module and executes it, then exits the program with its return value.",
  "sources": "Reading the sys module and calling the main function from the server module.",
  "sinks": "The sys.exit() function, which terminates the program with the output of main().",
  "flows": "Import sys -> import main from .server -> execute main() -> pass its result to sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The import of a local server module and immediate execution is typical for server scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing the system module and a local server module, then executing the main function from the server module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a standard entry point script for a server application. Without additional context about the server module, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python script serving as an entry point for a server application. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected in this code snippet.",
