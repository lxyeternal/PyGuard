{
  "purpose": "The code imports a main function from a local server module and executes it, then exits.",
  "sources": "sys and .server (imported main function)",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() called with the result of main()",
  "flows": "main() executes and its return value is passed to sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and execution pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module for system-level operations and a main function from a local server module. It then calls main() and exits with its return value. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is simple and typical for entry-point scripts, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious activity. Without details of the server module, no malicious behavior can be confirmed, but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply invokes the main function from a local server module and exits, with no obvious malicious intent or security risks visible. It appears to be a standard script for running a server application.",
