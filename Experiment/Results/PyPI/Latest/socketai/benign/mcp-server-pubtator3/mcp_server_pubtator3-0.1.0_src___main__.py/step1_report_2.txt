{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import a main function from a local module 'server' and execute it, then exit the program with its return code.",
  "sources": "sys (standard library import), main (imported from local 'server' module)",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(main()) — potentially exits the program with the return value of main()",
  "flows": "The main() function's output from the server module flows into sys.exit(), which terminates the process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed; code appears minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a main function from a local server module. It then calls main() and passes its return value to sys.exit(), which terminates the program. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code structure is simple and typical for entry-point scripts. Since the server module is local, its content would determine overall security, but from this fragment alone, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard entry point script that executes a main function from a local server module and terminates accordingly. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are detected based on this fragment alone.",
