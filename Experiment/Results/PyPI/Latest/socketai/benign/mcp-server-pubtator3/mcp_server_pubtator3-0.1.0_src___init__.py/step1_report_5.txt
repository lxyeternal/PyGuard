{
  "purpose": "Main entry point that initializes and runs the server asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'asyncio' module and a local 'server' module; it does not read external input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or output mechanisms are identified.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'asyncio.run(server.main())', which executes the server's main function asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a main() function that runs an async server's main() method using asyncio. The only external interaction is the invocation of 'server.main()', which is imported from a local module. No input parsing, data handling, or network operations are visible here. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple entry point to run a server asynchronously. It appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment.",
