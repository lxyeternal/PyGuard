  "purpose": "Minimal asyncio-based server bootstrap code that imports asyncio and a local server module, then runs server.main() asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or untrusted data; it imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: main() calls asyncio.run(server.main()), with no data passing from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected; the code is simple and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for starting an asyncio server. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security concern depends on the implementation of 'server.main()', which is external and unknown. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk. Confidence is high due to code simplicity and absence of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential risk stems from the external 'server' module, which cannot be evaluated here. The scores assigned are consistent and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
