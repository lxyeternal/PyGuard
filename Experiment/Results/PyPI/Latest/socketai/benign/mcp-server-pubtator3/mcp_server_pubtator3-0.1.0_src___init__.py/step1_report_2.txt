  "purpose": "Main entry point for the package that initializes and runs an asynchronous server.",
  "sources": "Imports the asyncio module and a local server module, then calls server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The call to server.main() could potentially be a sink if it handles untrusted data or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to invoking asyncio.run() with server.main().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it imports standard and local modules, and executes server.main() asynchronously. No data is read from untrusted sources explicitly. The server module's implementation is unknown, but based solely on this code, there are no indications of malicious behavior. The code functions as an entry point for an async server application without evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard entry point for an asynchronous server application. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
