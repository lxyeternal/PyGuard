{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for a Python package that runs an asynchronous server component.",
  "sources": "The code imports asyncio and a local module 'server', and calls server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "The code invokes server.main(), which could potentially execute malicious or unsafe server logic if the server module is compromised.",
  "flows": "import asyncio -> asyncio.run(server.main())",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard asyncio and a local server module. It defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. The code is simple, primarily serving as a launcher for the server module. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident at this level. Since server.main() is imported and invoked, any malicious behavior could originate from that module, but that cannot be assessed here. No anomalies or security risks are apparent within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal, standard entry point for a server application. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment itself. Its safety depends on the integrity of the server module it imports.",
