{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that runs the main function of a server module asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the call to server.main() within asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the execution of server.main(), which could perform various actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: main() calls asyncio.run() which executes server.main().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports asyncio and a local server module, then defines a main() function that runs server.main() asynchronously. It also defines a version string. The code appears to be a simple entry point for starting a server component. There are no suspicious patterns, no data leaks, no malicious code, and no unusual code behaviors. It is a typical pattern for starting async server applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is a standard entry point for running an asynchronous server function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
