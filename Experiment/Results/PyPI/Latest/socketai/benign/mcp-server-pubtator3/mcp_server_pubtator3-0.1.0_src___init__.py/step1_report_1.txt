{
  "purpose": "To serve as the main entry point for an asyncio-based server application.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'asyncio' module and a local 'server' module, then calls 'server.main()' within 'asyncio.run()'.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the call to 'asyncio.run(server.main())', which executes an asynchronous main function from the 'server' module.",
  "flows": "Input data (via asyncio or the environment) flows into 'server.main()' when called, but no direct data sources or untrusted inputs are visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard pattern for initiating an asyncio-based server. It imports the asyncio library and a local module named 'server'. The 'main' function executes 'server.main()' using 'asyncio.run', which is typical for asyncio programs. No user inputs, external data reads, or suspicious constructs are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a normal application bootstrap without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for an asyncio server application with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
