  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Its design and behavior pose minimal security risks, primarily related to external API interactions, which are properly validated and rate-limited. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low inherent risk."
