  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n\n- All reports identify that the code loads configuration variables from environment variables, with default values.\n- Multiple reports highlight that these default values include hardcoded sensitive credentials, such as:\n  - MongoDB URI with username and password embedded.\n  - API keys and tokens.\n- The presence of hardcoded secrets in defaults is a security concern, especially if environment variables are not set or defaults are used in production.\n- No reports mention malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions; it is purely configuration loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of hardcoded credentials** in default environment variable values.\n- **Insecure handling of secrets**—defaults include sensitive data, which could lead to credential leakage if environment variables are not properly set.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Embedding secrets as defaults** in source code is a critical security flaw, not an attack or malware, but a misconfiguration.\n- **No malicious code** or obfuscation is present.\n- **No evidence of malware or malicious intent**.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0**, which is appropriate.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are high (mostly 0.75–0.9), reflecting the insecure defaults, which is justified.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The **risk scores** are mostly around 0.7–0.9, which seems reasonable given the security implications.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The default inclusion of sensitive credentials (MongoDB URI, API keys) in source code **poses a high security risk** if these defaults are used in production or shared publicly.\n- The risk is **not just theoretical**; such defaults could be exploited to gain unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or compromise.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Malware = 0** across all reports, which is correct.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or code.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is not malicious but insecure.\n- No claims are based on assumptions about vulnerabilities beyond insecure secret handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0** — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nGiven the consistent presence of hardcoded secrets and the security implications, I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.8**. This reflects a serious security concern due to the potential for credential leakage and misuse, even though the code itself is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                       | No malicious activity present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                       | Code is clear and straightforward.                                    |\n| Security Risk     | 0.8                     | Hardcoded secrets in defaults pose high security risks if used improperly. |\n\n---\n\n**Overall, the main concern is insecure secret management, not malware or obfuscation.**  \nThe scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would slightly elevate the security risk to **0.8** to emphasize the severity of embedding secrets in defaults.",
