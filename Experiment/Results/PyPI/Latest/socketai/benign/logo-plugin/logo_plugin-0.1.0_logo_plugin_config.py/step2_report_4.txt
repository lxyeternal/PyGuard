  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It loads configuration variables from environment variables, with default values.\n- Defaults include sensitive credentials: a MongoDB URI with username/password, an API key, and a token.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or active malware is present.\n- The main issue is insecure handling of secrets due to hardcoded defaults.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of hardcoded credentials** in default environment variable values, notably:\n  - `MONGO_URI` default contains username and password.\n  - `API_KEY` default is a secret key.\n  - `LOGO_API_PATH_TOKEN` default appears to be a secret token.\n- **No malicious behavior** observed; the code is purely configuration loading.\n- **Security risks** are high if defaults are used in production, as secrets are exposed in source code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies hardcoded credentials and security risks.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Security risk:** 0.45 (moderate)\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just insecure defaults.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate, though the risk could be slightly higher given the exposure.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; highlights embedded credentials and security concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.9 (high), consistent with the severity of embedded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just insecure defaults.\n- **Score justification:** Correct; high because defaults contain secrets.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, emphasizes the embedded secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.75 (high)\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, but insecure defaults.\n- **Score justification:** Reasonable, though slightly lower than Report 2, reflecting slightly less emphasis.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same issues, highlights the embedded secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.9\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just insecure defaults.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same, notes insecure secret management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.7\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are high (around 0.7–0.9) due to embedded secrets, which is justified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The high scores are justified given the embedded secrets.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting the insecure handling of secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.8 (average of the high scores), considering the severity of embedded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the security concern—hardcoded secrets—but do not indicate malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the findings. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Critical note:** The primary concern is insecure secret management, not malware or obfuscation. The high risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend refactoring the code to remove default secrets, enforce environment variable configuration, and avoid embedding sensitive credentials in source code.",
