  "purpose": "Load configuration variables for database and API access, with defaults including sensitive credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MONGO_URI', 'DB_NAME', 'API_BASE_URL', 'LOGO_API_PATH_TOKEN', 'API_KEY' with default values.",
  "sinks": "Defaults embed secrets directly in code; if environment variables are unset, secrets are exposed in source.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables; defaults contain secrets; no further data flow or malicious activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Defaults include hardcoded secrets such as MongoDB URI with credentials, API keys, and tokens; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration from environment variables, providing defaults that include sensitive credentials. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. The primary concern is insecure secret management due to embedded secrets in defaults, which can lead to credential leakage if environment variables are not set. All reports correctly identify the presence of hardcoded secrets and assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are high (~0.75-0.9), justified by the potential exposure of secrets. The code itself is straightforward and lacks obfuscation. The main issue is configuration hygiene, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is insecure due to embedded secrets in default environment variables but does not contain malware or obfuscation. The high security risk scores are justified. No malicious activity is present. Recommendations include removing defaults with secrets and enforcing environment variable configuration to improve security.",
