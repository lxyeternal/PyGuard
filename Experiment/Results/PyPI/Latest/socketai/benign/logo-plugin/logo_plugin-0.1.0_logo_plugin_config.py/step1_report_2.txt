{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration variables for database connection, API access, and authentication tokens, using environment variables with default values.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'MONGO_URI', 'DB_NAME', 'API_BASE_URL', 'LOGO_API_PATH_TOKEN', 'API_KEY'.",
  "sinks": "Usage of these variables in database connection and API requests; potential exposure if variables are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and assigned to constants; these constants are likely used elsewhere in the application for database and API operations.",
  "anomalies": "The default values include hardcoded credentials such as a MongoDB URI with username and password, and an API key. This is a significant security concern, as defaults are publicly visible in the source code and can be exploited if environment variables are not properly set.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables for sensitive credentials, providing default values that include a hardcoded MongoDB URI with embedded credentials and an API key. Such hardcoded defaults pose a security risk if environment variables are not overridden. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself but stores sensitive information insecurely by embedding credentials in defaults. The potential for misuse arises if the environment variables are not securely managed or if defaults are used in production. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present; however, the insecure handling of secrets is a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious actions but exhibits poor security practice by including hardcoded credentials as defaults. This could lead to credential leakage and unauthorized access if environment variables are not securely set, representing a high security risk.",
