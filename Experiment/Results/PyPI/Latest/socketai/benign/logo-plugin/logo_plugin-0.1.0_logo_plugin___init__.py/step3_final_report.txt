  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization code importing a local class and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.service', assignment of __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static import and assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard package setup with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py or setup file importing a class from a local module and defining a version. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious payloads. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only minor point is a very low security risk score (0.1) in one report, which is an overestimation given the simplicity. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero. The code’s minimal and static nature indicates no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores across reports are appropriate, though the slight security risk score can be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the package is safe and standard.",
