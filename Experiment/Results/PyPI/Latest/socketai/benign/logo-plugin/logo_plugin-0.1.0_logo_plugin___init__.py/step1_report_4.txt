  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports a class and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, sets a version string, and does not contain any other logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The import is standard for a package setup, and no external data handling or potentially dangerous code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package declaration with a single import and version assignment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
