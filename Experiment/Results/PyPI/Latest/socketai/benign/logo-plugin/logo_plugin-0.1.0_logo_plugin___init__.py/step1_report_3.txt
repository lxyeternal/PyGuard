  "purpose": "Define the package version and import the LogoService class from the service module",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .service import LogoService",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statement is static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic; the import is relative and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package by importing a class from a local module and specifies a version. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The import is standard for package structure. No data leaks, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
