  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the original code:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The original code is straightforward:\n   ```python\n   from .service import LogoService\n\n   __version__ = '0.1.0'\n   ```\n   It simply imports a class from a local module and sets a version string. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code is minimal and typical for package initialization.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - The only minor point is a very slight security risk score (0.1) in report 3, but given the code's simplicity, this appears to be an overestimation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - **Risk Score**: The highest is 0.1, which is negligible. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The only concern could be the import from a local module, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's simplicity and safety profile.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports' assessments are consistent, and the scores are appropriate, though they could be marginally lowered to zero.",
