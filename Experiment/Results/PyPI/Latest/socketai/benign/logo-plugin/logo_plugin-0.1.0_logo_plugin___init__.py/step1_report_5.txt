  "purpose": "Define a Python package by importing a service class and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module '.service'. It reads the version string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports a module and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, indicating modular design. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious. No input/output, network activity, or complex logic is present. The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply declares a package and its version.",
