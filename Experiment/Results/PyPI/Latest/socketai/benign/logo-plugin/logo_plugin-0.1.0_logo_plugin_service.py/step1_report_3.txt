  "purpose": "This script fetches company logos via an external API, stores them in a MongoDB GridFS, and allows retrieval by root domain.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments; reads API credentials and configuration from imported config module; reads logo data from API response.",
  "sinks": "Writes logo images to local file system; interacts with MongoDB/GridFS for storing and retrieving files.",
  "flows": "User provides root domain via CLI -> fetch_and_store() calls external API -> stores image in GridFS -> retrieve() reads image from GridFS -> saves image locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials in the visible code; dependencies are standard and reputable; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected; API URL construction is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with external APIs and a database but does so using standard libraries and straightforward logic. API credentials are imported from a config module, reducing exposure. The code fetches image data, stores it securely in GridFS, and allows retrieval without processing untrusted input beyond the API request. There are no evident backdoors, suspicious data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The only external interaction is the API request, which appears legitimate given the context. File handling is standard, and no unusual or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for fetching and storing logos using publicly documented APIs and standard database storage. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on this code snippet.",
