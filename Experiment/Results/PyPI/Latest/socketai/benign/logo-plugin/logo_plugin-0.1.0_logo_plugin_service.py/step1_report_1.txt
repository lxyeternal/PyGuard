  "purpose": "The code fetches company logos from an external API based on root domain input, stores them in MongoDB GridFS, and allows retrieval and saving of stored logos.",
  "sources": "Input from command line argument 'root_domain'; API request URL and headers; environment variables from .config imported constants",
  "sinks": "File writing to output directory; API request to external server; MongoDB GridFS storage",
  "flows": "Command line input -> API request URL construction -> External API response -> Storage in GridFS -> Retrieval from GridFS -> File output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no suspicious API domains; usage of environment variables for API keys; standard requests usage; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no code injection points; proper error handling; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility to fetch and store logos via an external API, using environment variables for sensitive data. It communicates securely with the external API through headers with API keys. Logos are stored in MongoDB's GridFS with proper metadata, and retrieval writes files to disk. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hidden backdoors, no network connections besides the intended API, and no use of obfuscation or code injection techniques are present. The code does not perform any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or stealth operations. It operates transparently, with clear flow and no signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing company logos via an API with secure storage. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It follows standard practices for API communication and file handling, with no evident security risks or backdoors.",
