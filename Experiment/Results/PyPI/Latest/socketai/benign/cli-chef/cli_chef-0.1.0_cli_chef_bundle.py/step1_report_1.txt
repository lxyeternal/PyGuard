{
  "purpose": "This script recursively bundles files with specified extensions from a given directory into a single output file, including headers with relative paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads input directory paths, output file path, and extension options from command-line arguments. It also reads file contents during processing.",
  "sinks": "Writing to the output file; reading file contents; echoing log messages to the console.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to discover files, then their contents are read and written to an output file, with headers indicating their relative paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. Use of 'errors=replace' during file reading is a robustness measure but not suspicious. The script's logic is straightforward for file bundling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, file reading, and writing output with detailed logging. It handles common file errors gracefully, with no indication of malicious intent. The operations are standard for a bundling utility. No external network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation is present. The code's structure and comments are clear and typical for such a utility.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for bundling files based on extensions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware signatures. There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns. Overall, it seems safe and aligned with its intended purpose.",
