  "purpose": "A command-line utility that recursively finds files with specified extensions in a directory, concatenates their contents into a single output file, and prepends each with a header indicating its relative path.",
  "sources": "Directory traversal using Path.rglob, reading file contents with open(..., errors='replace')",
  "sinks": "Writing concatenated content and headers into the output file",
  "flows": "Source: directory traversal -> File reading (with error handling) -> Writing headers and content to output",
  "anomalies": "Use of errors='replace' during file reading, which masks decoding errors but is a common robustness measure; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard directory traversal, file reading, and writing operations with comprehensive error handling. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious network calls, or suspicious patterns. The use of 'errors=replace' is for robustness, not malicious intent. All operations are consistent with a benign file bundler utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign file concatenation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a minimal security risk (~0.2) due to error masking, which is standard practice.",
