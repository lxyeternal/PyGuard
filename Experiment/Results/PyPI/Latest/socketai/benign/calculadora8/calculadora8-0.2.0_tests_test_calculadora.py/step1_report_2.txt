  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Calculadora class to verify basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Importing pytest and Calculadora module, class and method definitions, test method calls and assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data in test methods flow through the Calculadora methods; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is standard for testing a calculator class.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases for a calculator class, using standard pytest framework. No external data sources, network calls, or environment variables are accessed. The methods test basic arithmetic functions with straightforward assertions. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are present. The structure and content are typical for unit testing, with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a calculator class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
