  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a `Calculadora` class, testing basic arithmetic operations and division by zero handling.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or environment variables are used.\n   - The code contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The tests use only hardcoded numeric literals and standard pytest assertions.\n   - No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Security Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external dependencies that could be exploited.\n   - The analysis is consistent across reports, with no contradictions or overlooked issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations:**\n   - Since the code is purely for unit testing, the risk of supply chain attack or malicious payload is negligible.\n   - The reports do not mention any dependency vulnerabilities; the only external dependency is `pytest`, which is standard and well-known.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified given the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness.\n\n5. **Overall Estimation:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assessments that the code is safe.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a typical, benign test suite for a calculator class.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as all evidence points to safety.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.",
