  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Calculadora class, verifying basic arithmetic operations and division by zero handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded numeric literals within test methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling arithmetic methods with hardcoded inputs; no external data flows or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, readable test suite for a calculator class, with no external dependencies beyond pytest. It does not include any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The tests use only hardcoded values and standard assertions. No external data, network calls, or environment variables are involved. The code's structure and content are benign, and the reports confirm this assessment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this conclusion is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
