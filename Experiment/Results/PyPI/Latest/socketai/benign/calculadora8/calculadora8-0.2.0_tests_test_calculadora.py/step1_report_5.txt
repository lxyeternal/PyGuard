{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the Calculadora class, designed to verify arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method calls on the self.calc object, which are the test inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that transmit or store untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows that involve untrusted data leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard unit test suite for a calculator class using pytest. It initializes a calculator object and runs multiple assertions to verify correctness of methods. No external data input, no suspicious logic, no use of environment variables, network calls, or code execution. The structure and content are typical for testing numerical functions. There is no obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risk evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
