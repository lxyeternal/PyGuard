  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a calculator class (`Calculadora`) using pytest.\n   - All tests are simple assertions verifying arithmetic operations.\n   - No external data sources, environment variables, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code appears benign, standard, and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.\n   - They do not identify any technical inaccuracies; their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis, as no malicious or obfuscated behavior is observed.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is clearly benign, raising the risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The code is a standard unit test suite with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's nature; no malicious actions are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the observable code without assumptions about hidden behavior.\n   - This is appropriate; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard unit testing script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are detected.\n- The scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the evidence, I agree with the current scores.\n- My estimated scores:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
