  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Calculadora class to verify arithmetic operations correctness.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pytest and Calculadora class, class setup_method, and test methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; tests only call class methods with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and a local Calculadora class, then defines a test suite with setup and multiple test methods for arithmetic functions. All test inputs are hardcoded numeric literals, with no external data or user input. The code strictly performs unit testing without side effects, external communications, or malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for a test suite, and no suspicious behaviors or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script for a calculator class, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
