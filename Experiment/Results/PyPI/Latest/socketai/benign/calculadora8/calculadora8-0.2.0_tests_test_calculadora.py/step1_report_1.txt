  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Calculadora class to verify arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest and calculadora module, class and method definitions, test cases with input values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow through the Calculadora methods; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and a calculator module, then defines a test class with setup and multiple test methods. These methods validate basic arithmetic operations, including exception handling for division by zero. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code strictly performs unit tests without external interactions or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of unit tests for a calculator class. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code appears safe and intentionally designed for testing purposes only.",
