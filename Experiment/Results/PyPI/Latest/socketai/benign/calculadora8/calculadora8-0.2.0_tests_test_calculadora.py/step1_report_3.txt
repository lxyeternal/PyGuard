  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Calculadora class, verifying basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`pytest`, `calculadora`) and class/method definitions within the test suite.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Test methods call methods of the Calculadora instance, no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual or obfuscated behavior. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a calculator module, then defines a test class with setup and multiple test methods for calculator functions. No external data inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious behaviors, and no code that would be malicious. The code strictly performs unit tests, which are benign. No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign test suite for a calculator class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate test code for verifying calculator functionalities.",
