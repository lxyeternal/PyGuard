  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'calculadora8'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to assign to long_description; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. It uses standard practices for Python packaging without any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no external modules are fetched or invoked at install time. Overall, the code is straightforward and follows normal setup conventions without suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for package configuration.",
