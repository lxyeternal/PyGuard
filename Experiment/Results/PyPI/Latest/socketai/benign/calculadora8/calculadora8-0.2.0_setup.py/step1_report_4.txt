  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'calculadora8' with basic metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; setup parameters are static strings and method calls.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> Assigning to variable -> Passing variables to setup() -> No data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of standard setup() function with static parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to prepare a Python package. It reads a markdown file for the description, which is typical. No suspicious code, network operations, or malicious logic present. The code is straightforward, and the variables are static, with no dynamic execution or obfuscation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
