  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'calculadora8' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into 'descricao_longa' used in setup() for description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or suspicious features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to prepare a package. It reads a README file for the long description and calls setup() with typical parameters such as name, version, author, and dependencies. The 'install_requires' list is empty, indicating no external dependencies. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply reads a documentation file and configures package metadata. No security risks identified.",
