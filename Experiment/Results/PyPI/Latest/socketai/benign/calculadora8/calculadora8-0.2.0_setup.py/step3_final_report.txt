  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'calculadora8', providing package metadata and reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static package metadata without external data or network calls",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static metadata used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and conventional setup script with no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, reading a static README.md file, and calling setup() with fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
