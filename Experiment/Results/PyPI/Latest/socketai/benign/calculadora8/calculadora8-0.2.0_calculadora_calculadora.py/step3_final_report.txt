  "purpose": "A simple calculator class implementing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "sources": "Method arguments a and b in each arithmetic function; division method checks for zero divisor.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the result; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow through arithmetic operations and return results; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes proper handling of division by zero. No external data access, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and correctness support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a calculator with no malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores and assessments are accurate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
