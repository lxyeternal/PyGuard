{
  "purpose": "A simple calculator class providing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "sources": "The code does not read input from external sources or user inputs; all data is passed via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network connections. It only performs internal computations and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments (a, b) through arithmetic operations within each method, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic arithmetic functions with proper input arguments. No external input/output, network operations, or data storage is present. The division method properly raises an exception on division by zero, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or covert behavior. The code appears clean, simple, and intended solely for calculation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of arithmetic operations with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security risks.",
