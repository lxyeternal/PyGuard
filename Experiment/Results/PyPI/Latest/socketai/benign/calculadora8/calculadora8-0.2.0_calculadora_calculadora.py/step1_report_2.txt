  "purpose": "A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b in each method, which are used for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the calculation results; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b) flow into each method; results are returned directly; no external or untrusted data flows out or into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic arithmetic functions with standard implementations and input validation for division by zero. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious side effects. The code is well-structured, simple, and does not include external dependencies or network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a calculator class. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
