  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator with no external data access, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The code provided matches the description and contains no anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is simple, safe, and free of malicious or suspicious features. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty. These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely arithmetic with no external interactions or malicious features, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code features, not assumptions. They correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, safe implementation of basic arithmetic operations. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
