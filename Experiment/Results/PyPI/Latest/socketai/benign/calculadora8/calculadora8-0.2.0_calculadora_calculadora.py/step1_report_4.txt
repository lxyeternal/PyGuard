  "purpose": "A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input arguments a and b in each method (soma, subtracao, multiplicacao, divisao).",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the result of arithmetic operations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into arithmetic operations; results flow out through return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic arithmetic functions within a class structure. It uses straightforward calculations with input validation only for division by zero. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior. The methods are simple and serve standard mathematical purposes, with appropriate exception handling for division.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a calculator class performing basic arithmetic operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
