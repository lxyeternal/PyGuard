  "purpose": "A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in each method.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting calculation results; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through arithmetic operations to return results; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic arithmetic functions with proper documentation and error handling for division by zero. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears straightforward and typical for a calculator implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard arithmetic operations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
