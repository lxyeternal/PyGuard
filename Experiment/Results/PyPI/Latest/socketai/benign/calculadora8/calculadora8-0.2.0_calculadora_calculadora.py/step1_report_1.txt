  "purpose": "A simple calculator class implementing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).",
  "sources": "Input parameters for each method (a, b).",
  "sinks": "Return statements of each method (the computed results).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b) flow into the respective arithmetic operation, then the result flows to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The class defines basic arithmetic functions with standard input parameters and straightforward return statements. There are no external data reads, no network operations, no file access, and no unusual code constructs. The division method properly raises an exception for division by zero, which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of a calculator without malicious behavior or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple arithmetic calculator with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs basic operations safely and transparently.",
