  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator class with basic arithmetic operations.\n- No external data access, network activity, or malicious code is observed.\n- Proper handling of division by zero is noted.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty in their assessments.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating the code is not obfuscated.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Given the thoroughness and agreement among reports, the current scores seem appropriate.\n- Since no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, increasing any scores would be unwarranted.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n- The reports do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are justified and should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is appropriate given the consistent analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of a calculator class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
