  "purpose": "Importing the Calculadora class from a local module 'calculadora'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform actions that could cause data leaks or harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible beyond import; no runtime data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or interaction with external systems. The minimal structure provides no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving only to import a class from a local module. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present.",
