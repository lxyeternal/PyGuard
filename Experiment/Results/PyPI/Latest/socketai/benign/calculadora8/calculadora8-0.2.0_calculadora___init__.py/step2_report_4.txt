  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them to the original code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .calculadora import Calculadora\n```\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import statement.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- No data flows, external communications, or runtime behaviors are observed.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero or very low, reflecting benign assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code is a simple import statement importing `Calculadora` from a local module.\n- **Issue presence:** **No.** The code appears standard and benign.\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.9 confidence in benignity.\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n### Step 4: Justify higher risk scores\n- Since the code is a simple import, a higher risk score (e.g., >0.5) would be unjustified.\n- No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they only analyze the code snippet.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made beyond the benign import.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Given the simplicity of the code, there's no reason to increase the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Work completed.**",
