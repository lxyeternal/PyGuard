  "purpose": "This code imports the Calculadora class from a local module named calculadora, serving to include functionality defined elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'calculadora' and the class 'Calculadora'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the class from the local module; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class from a local module. It involves no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard Python syntax with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this. No modifications are necessary.",
