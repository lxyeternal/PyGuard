  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is: `from .calculadora import Calculadora`\n   - This is a standard Python import statement importing the `Calculadora` class from a local module named `calculadora`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or external communications are involved.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a simple, benign import statement.\n   - They consistently note the absence of anomalies, suspicious behavior, or data flows.\n   - No report mentions any code execution beyond import, which is accurate.\n   - No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0.\n   - This is justified, as the code is a simple import with no malicious features.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they focus on the code's content.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import statement importing a class from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The high confidence scores support this conclusion. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign import statement with no security concerns. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
