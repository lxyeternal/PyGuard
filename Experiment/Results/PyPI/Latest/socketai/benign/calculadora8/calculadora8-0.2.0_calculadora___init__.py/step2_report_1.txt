  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .calculadora import Calculadora`.  \nThis is a straightforward import of a class from a local module, with no additional code, data flow, or external communication.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident.  \n- The assessments are consistent and accurate based on the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.  \n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- No issues warrant a higher risk score because the code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, data flow, or external interaction.  \n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Recommendations:**  \n- The code is a basic import statement with no security concerns.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)  \n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is a minimal, benign import statement. It does not pose any security threat and functions as part of standard modular Python code.",
