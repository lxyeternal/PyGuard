  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .calculadora import Calculadora`.\n   - The code snippet provided is identical across reports, confirming that no additional code, data flows, or malicious behavior is present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Logic and Reasoning**:\n   - Each report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward import statement.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are detected.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate: importing a class from a local module is standard practice and inherently benign.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence scores are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear and straightforward analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here; the scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond the code itself, which is correct.\n   - Since the code is only an import statement, there's no basis for claiming vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:\n   - Both are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n   - The code doesn't execute any untrusted code, handle data, or perform network operations.\n\n6. **Overall Security Risk**:\n   - The security risk score is appropriately 0 across all reports, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard import statement.\n- All reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications or concerns are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are justified and can stay as they are.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis is a straightforward, benign import statement with no security concerns.",
