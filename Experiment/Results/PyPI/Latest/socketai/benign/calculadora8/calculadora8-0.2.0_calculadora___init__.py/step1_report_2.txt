  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, only a single import statement; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The import could be part of a larger project; on its own, it shows no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no malicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger program.",
