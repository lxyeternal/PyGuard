  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - The code is `from .calculadora import Calculadora`.\n   - The report states it's a straightforward import with no suspicious features.\n   - **Assessment**: Confirmed. The import is standard, referencing a local module. No data flows, no external communication, no anomalies.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - Same import statement, with similar reasoning.\n   - **Assessment**: Confirmed. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - Same import, with a confidence of 1.\n   - **Assessment**: Confirmed. No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - Same import, with high confidence.\n   - **Assessment**: Confirmed. No malicious activity or anomalies.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - Same import, with full confidence.\n   - **Assessment**: Confirmed. No suspicious features or malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, straightforward import statement.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code snippet is entirely benign.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
