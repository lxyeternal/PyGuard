  "purpose": "Importing the Calculadora class from a local module named calculadora",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; minimal code present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing a class from a local module. There are no function calls, data processing, external communication, or other code behavior that could indicate malicious intent. The import appears standard for modular Python code. Due to the simplicity and lack of additional context or code, no malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase.",
