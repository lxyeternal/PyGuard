  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security risks and malicious behavior in the analyzed Python dependency code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), file reads, network connections, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file system modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution functions or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() or exec(), obfuscation patterns, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, complex or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate either absence of code or benign patterns, with scores reflecting high confidence in safety. Reports 4 and 5 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with low risk in benign cases and moderate to high suspicion where obfuscation and dynamic execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears safe in most cases, with some reports indicating potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution that warrant cautious monitoring. The scoring aligns well with the observed patterns, and no major discrepancies are identified.",
