  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external URLs, environment variables, hardcoded credentials, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, data exfiltration points, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded URLs or credentials, suspicious external connections, unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code with no content or minimal structure (Reports 1, 3, 5) shows no malicious activity, scores are zero, and reasoning is sound. Report 2 indicates obfuscation and uncertainty, with low malware (0.2) and moderate obfuscation (0.4), consistent with cautious suspicion. Report 4 demonstrates multiple red flags: dynamic execution, obfuscation, external URLs, hardcoded secrets, leading to high scores (malware 0.75, obfuscated 0.9, risk 0.8). These scores align with the detailed behaviors described. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the evidence, with Report 4 being the most suspicious, and others showing low or no risk.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores across all reports are appropriate and well-justified based on the provided evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary. High suspicion in Report 4 warrants ongoing monitoring, while reports with no code or benign descriptions are correctly scored as low risk.",
