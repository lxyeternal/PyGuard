{
  "purpose": "The code defines an inference class for Bayesian neural network inference using sbi and torch libraries, enabling training and sampling from prior/posterior distributions.",
  "sources": "Inputs include the prior distribution, data arrays x and theta, and optional seed for randomness. The code reads data for inference and sampling from distributions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs include the posterior object, prior samples, and posterior samples. No sinks handle untrusted data directly; the output is for further use.",
  "flows": "Data flows from prior sampling or data input to model training and then to posterior sampling. No evident flow leads to external systems or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard Bayesian inference tasks without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries for Bayesian inference and tensor operations. It defines methods for training inference models and sampling from prior and posterior distributions. The functions use standard parameters and library calls without any suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious network operations are present. The code handles inputs and outputs securely, with optional seeding for randomness, and proper data shape adjustments. There are no signs of data leaks, credential use, or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation for Bayesian inference using sbi and torch libraries. It performs legitimate tasks such as sampling and training inference models without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
