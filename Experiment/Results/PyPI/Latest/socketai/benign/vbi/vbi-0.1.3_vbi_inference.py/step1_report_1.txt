{
  "purpose": "The code implements an inference class for training and sampling from posterior distributions using SBI (Simulation-Based Inference) methods, specifically SNPE, SNLE, and SNRE.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include prior distributions, data arrays (x and theta), and observation points (xo). External functions like process_prior are called to process the prior.",
  "sinks": "Sampling functions call prior.sample() and posterior.sample(), and the code sets the random seed with torch.manual_seed(). No data is sent over the network or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (theta, x, prior, xo) flows into model training or sampling functions. Prior sampling flows from prior.sample() to output theta. Posterior sampling flows from posterior.sample() to output samples. Seed setting affects random number generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution. External package usage (torch, sbi, vbi) is typical for this domain.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SBI inference routines. It includes methods for training models and sampling from priors and posteriors, with input validation and seed control. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. Usage of process_prior suggests proper handling of prior distributions. The code does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Bayesian inference tasks with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical operations expected in a probabilistic inference library without suspicious behavior.",
