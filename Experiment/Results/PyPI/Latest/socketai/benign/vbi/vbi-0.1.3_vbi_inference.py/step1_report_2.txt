{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for performing likelihood-free inference using neural density estimators, specifically SNPE, SNLE, or SNRE methods, with functions for training models, sampling from the prior, and sampling from the posterior.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'theta', 'x', 'prior', 'xo', 'num_samples', 'seed', and 'device'. It also reads external libraries and modules like torch, vbi.utils, and sbi.inference.",
  "sinks": "Sampling functions use the posterior object to generate samples; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified. No network connections or data exfiltration functions are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs like 'theta', 'x', and 'prior' flow into training functions and posterior sampling functions. Data from prior sampling is used for simulations, and posterior sampling uses observations to generate samples.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated sections. The code relies on external inference libraries and standard data handling. No signs of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for inference training, prior sampling, and posterior sampling, utilizing established libraries for probabilistic inference. It validates input types, manages random seeds, and processes priors with external functions. No suspicious logic or malicious patterns are evident. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration points are present. The code appears to perform standard probabilistic inference workflows with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a probabilistic inference class using established libraries. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
