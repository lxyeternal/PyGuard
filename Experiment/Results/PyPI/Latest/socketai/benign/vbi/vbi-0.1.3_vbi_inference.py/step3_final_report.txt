  "purpose": "Implement Bayesian inference routines for parameter estimation and sampling using the sbi library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as theta, x, prior, seed, and observation point xo.",
  "sinks": "Sampling functions that generate posterior or prior samples; no data leaks or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into inference object creation, appending simulations, training, and posterior building; seed setting influences sampling randomness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an inference class utilizing sbi and torch libraries. It performs input normalization, seed setting, and inference training without any network activity or malicious constructs. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The functions for sampling prior and posterior are straightforward, with proper input validation. External dependencies are typical for this domain and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Bayesian inference utility with no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
