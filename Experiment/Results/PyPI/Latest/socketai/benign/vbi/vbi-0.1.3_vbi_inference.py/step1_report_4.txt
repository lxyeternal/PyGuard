{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for performing simulation-based inference (SNPE, SNLE, SNRE) on probabilistic models using the 'sbi' library. It provides methods to train inference models and sample from priors and posteriors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for 'train' method (theta, x, prior), and method arguments (method, device, density_estimator). Input for 'sample_prior' (prior, seed), and for 'sample_posterior' (xo, posterior).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations include sampling from prior distributions and posterior, which could be misused if misconfigured. No obvious data leakage, network communication, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs like 'prior', 'theta', 'x' flow into model training; 'prior' and seed into sampling prior; 'xo' and 'posterior' into sampling from the posterior. These flows are standard for probabilistic inference workflows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as code injection, hidden backdoors, or unusual data flows. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden malicious activities. Use of external library functions appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports widely-used libraries for scientific computing and probabilistic inference. It defines an 'Inference' class with methods to train models and generate samples. The 'train' method configures inference algorithms based on the specified method, with standard parameter handling and seed setting for reproducibility. Sampling functions properly handle tensor inputs. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious network activity are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose in probabilistic modeling and inference workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for probabilistic inference using the 'sbi' library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions as a typical inference utility without suspicious behaviors.",
