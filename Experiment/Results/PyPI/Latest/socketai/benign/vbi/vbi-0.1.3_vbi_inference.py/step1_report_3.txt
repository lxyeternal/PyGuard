{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for conducting Bayesian inference using various methods (SNPE, SNLE, SNRE), including training models and sampling from prior and posterior distributions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as 'x', 'theta', 'prior', 'xo', and optional seeds for randomness.",
  "sinks": "Samples are generated and returned as torch tensors; no data is directly written to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model training and sampling functions; prior sampling and posterior sampling generate output tensors, but no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or malicious obfuscation detected. Use of third-party libraries is standard for Bayesian inference tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Bayesian inference class. It initializes inference models based on the selected method, appends simulation data, trains the models, and samples from prior/posterior distributions. Functions properly handle input validation, seed setting, and tensor shaping. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is reliance on external libraries (sbi, torch), but this is standard for the context. No suspicious network activity or harmful operations identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate Bayesian inference operations without malicious intent. It appears to be a typical implementation with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
