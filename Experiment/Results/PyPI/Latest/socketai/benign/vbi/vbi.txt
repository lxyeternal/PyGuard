      "conclusion": "The script is a typical build process for SWIG-based C++ extensions with no active malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is supply chain integrity—if interface files are compromised, malicious code could be executed during build. Implementing validation, checksums, or sandboxing can mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding external file trustworthiness."

Its main security concern is executing commands based on untrusted input without validation, which could be exploited in malicious environments. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a moderate security risk but no active malicious intent."

High suspicion in Report 4 warrants ongoing monitoring, while reports with no code or benign descriptions are correctly scored as low risk."

No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but the techniques used justify moderate suspicion. Final scores are consistent with the evidence, emphasizing the importance of further static/dynamic analysis for suspicious cases."
