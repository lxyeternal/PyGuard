{
  "purpose": "The code serves as part of a package's internal utilities, primarily importing modules and retrieving version information from a local file.",
  "sources": "Reading the '_version.py' file to extract the '__version__' string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "flows": "Source: reading '_version.py' -> sink: extracting version string; no other data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard pattern for version retrieval. Potential tampering of '_version.py' is a general supply chain concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and reads a version string from a local file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The file reading is a common pattern, and no dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minimal concern is if '_version.py' is tampered with, but this is a general supply chain risk, not specific malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports and version retrieval without any malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
