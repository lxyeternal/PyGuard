{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports various modules and functions related to feature extraction, utility functions, and version management.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the file system to obtain the version information via 'get_version()' function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not write untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads the '_version.py' file to extract the '__version__' string; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'get_version()' function reads a local file '_version.py' and extracts version info using simple string parsing, which is a standard approach. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated or unusual code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and defines a function to retrieve the package version. The function reads a local file '_version.py' to extract the '__version__' string. The import statements are typical for a modular Python package, and no malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The method of reading the version file is straightforward and safe, with no evident vulnerabilities. Overall, the code appears standard and secure, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical part of a Python package structure, performing module imports and a simple version retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
