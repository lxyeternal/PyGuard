{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various utility functions, features extraction functions, and version information from internal packages for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system to retrieve version information from '_version.py'. It also imports functions and modules from the package's internal structure.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks that process untrusted input; the only file I/O is reading the version file, which is controlled by the package itself.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing modules and reading the version string from a local file; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code uses standard import statements and straightforward file reading. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from internal modules and a function 'get_version()' that reads the package version from a local file '_version.py'. The version reading function opens the file, searches for a line starting with '__version__', and extracts the version string. This is a typical pattern for version retrieval. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. All code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and version retrieval script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads version information from a controlled file and imports internal functions for use elsewhere. No malware or security threats are detected.",
