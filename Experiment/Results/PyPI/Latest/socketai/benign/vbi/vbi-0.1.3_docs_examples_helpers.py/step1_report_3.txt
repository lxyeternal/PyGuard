{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for signal processing, analysis, and visualization, specifically for spectral and time-domain analysis of signals.",
  "sources": "Input data 'data' dictionaries containing time 't' and signal 'x', parameters such as 'dt', 'record_step', 't_transition', 't_end', and 'G'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; plotting functions generate visualizations, and spectral computations process input signals.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' and 'params' through processing functions like fft_signal and signal.welch, leading to plotting outputs; no suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are present. Functions perform standard spectral analysis and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple signal processing functions including FFT, Welch spectral estimates, and plotting routines. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears appropriate for data analysis. No code injections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The functions are for analysis and visualization, with no network or system command executions.\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate analytical toolkit for spectral and time-domain signal analysis with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard signal analysis and visualization module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical spectral analysis and plotting tasks safely.",
