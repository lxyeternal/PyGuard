{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for analyzing and plotting time-series signals and their spectral properties, specifically using Fourier transforms and Welch's method.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'data' dictionary ('t' and 'x'), and configuration parameters from 'par' or 'params'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; functions mainly generate plots and perform spectral analysis without external data transmission or unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data ('t', 'x') is processed to compute spectral features and plotted. No evident flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. All functions perform standard spectral and plotting operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). It defines functions for Fourier analysis and plotting of signals, using Welch's method and FFT, with parameters controlled via input dictionaries. No dynamic code execution, no external network operations, and no handling of sensitive credentials or environment variables. The functions are primarily for data visualization and spectral analysis, with no indication of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard scientific analysis and plotting routines for time-series data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious activity.",
