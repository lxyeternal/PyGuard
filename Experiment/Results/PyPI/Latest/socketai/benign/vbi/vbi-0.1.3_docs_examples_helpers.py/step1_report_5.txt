{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform signal processing and visualization tasks, including FFT analysis and power spectral density plotting, likely for scientific or engineering data analysis.",
  "sources": "Data sources are primarily 'data' dictionaries containing time ('t') and signal ('x') arrays, as well as 'par' and 'params' dictionaries providing parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks or untrusted data transmission points; it primarily processes and visualizes data locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data', 'par', and 'params' inputs into functions that compute spectral analyses (FFT, Welch), then plots results on provided axes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Usage of third-party libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) is standard for scientific code. The only minor point is the presence of a print statement for frequency analysis results, but this is typical for debugging or informational output.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spectral analysis using FFT and Welch methods, and visualizes results with matplotlib. It imports external feature utility functions, but no external network or I/O operations are present. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate scientific analysis scripts. No potential malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific signal processing and visualization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly analyzes and plots data locally, with no external network or suspicious data handling. Overall, it appears safe.",
