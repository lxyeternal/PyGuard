{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for analyzing and plotting signals, including Fourier transforms, power spectral density calculations, and visualization routines.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from dictionary inputs ('data' with keys 't' and 'x'), as well as parameters from 'par' or 'params' dictionaries. It also imports external libraries and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots via matplotlib, which are not considered sinks for malicious data flow. No data is written to files, sent over networks, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'data' and 'params' or 'par' flows into signal processing functions; processed data is visualized with matplotlib. No untrusted external data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard scientific computing libraries. The only unusual aspect is the use of 'km_order' from an external module, which could be scrutinized further but appears to be a legitimate function. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script contains multiple plotting functions for signal analysis, utilizing numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. It performs FFT, Welch PSD, and custom analyses like 'km_order'. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or file manipulations are present. All external libraries are standard or are imported from a local module. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as data exfiltration, system access, or backdoors, are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code is standard signal analysis and visualization code with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, intended for scientific or data analysis purposes.",
