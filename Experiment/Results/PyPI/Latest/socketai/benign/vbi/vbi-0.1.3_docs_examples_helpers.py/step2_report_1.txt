  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily a set of signal processing and plotting functions using numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.\n- No network, file, or external data sinks are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The only external module of concern is `km_order` from `vbi.feature_extraction.features_utils`, which appears to be a legitimate utility function.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are detected.\n- The code is consistent with scientific analysis routines.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard signal analysis and plotting.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which is high.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, signal analysis and visualization.\n- **Security assessment:** No suspicious activity or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, very high.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Signal spectral analysis and visualization.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, indicating certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Spectral analysis functions.\n- **Security assessment:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, fitting the code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, very confident.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Signal processing and visualization.\n- **Security assessment:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, which is reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low, ranging from 0 to 0.2, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly because the code could be misused if embedded in a malicious context, but as-is, it’s safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations like network communication, file writing, or code injection.\n- The external function `km_order` is from a presumably legitimate local module.\n- The code is typical for scientific data analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate.**\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (already reasonable, but could be lowered further to 0 if desired)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
