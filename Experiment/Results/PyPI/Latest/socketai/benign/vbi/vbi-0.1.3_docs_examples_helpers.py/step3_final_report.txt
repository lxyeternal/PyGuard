  "purpose": "Signal processing and visualization of spectral data using numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Data read from dictionaries ('t' and 'x') within the 'data' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Plots generated via matplotlib; no external network, file, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into processing functions, then to plotting routines; no external sinks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs identified. Usage of external 'km_order' appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral analysis (FFT, Welch PSD) and plotting routines for scientific data. No network or file I/O, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. External dependency 'km_order' from a local module is presumed benign. The code's purpose aligns with data analysis, not malicious activity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the routines. Confidence in this assessment is high (≥0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malware or obfuscation. It is a standard scientific analysis toolkit with minimal security risk. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
