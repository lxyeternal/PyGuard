{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing and plotting signals, including FFT and power spectral density, likely for signal processing or research purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' dictionary (keys 't' and 'x') and 'params' dictionary; no untrusted external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions generate visualizations; no data leakage, network communication, or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Data from 'data' and 'params' is processed through spectral analysis functions and plotted; no untrusted data flow to external systems or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Use of standard libraries for scientific computing and plotting is typical. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions for spectral analysis and plotting of time-series data, utilizing common scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The functions process input data for visualization and spectral analysis, including FFT, Welch method, and custom plotting. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or suspicious data handling routines. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code features are evident. The code appears to be well-structured, legitimate, and intended for signal analysis tasks. No signs of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data analysis utility with no malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, and no evident security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate for signal processing and visualization purposes.",
