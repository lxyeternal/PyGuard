  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code appears to be standard signal processing and plotting routines. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.  \n   - The only external dependency that might warrant scrutiny is `km_order` from `vbi.feature_extraction.features_utils`. Without its implementation, we cannot fully rule out hidden behaviors, but it seems to be a legitimate utility function.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence scores (mostly 0.9 or above).  \n   - They correctly identify that the code mainly performs spectral analysis and visualization, with no network or file I/O.  \n   - The reports do not flag any obfuscation or malicious behavior, which aligns with the code review.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**  \n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0 or very close to 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also low, consistent with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \n   - Since the code is purely analytical and visualization-focused, with no network, file, or dynamic code execution, higher risk scores are unwarranted.  \n   - The only potential concern is the external function `km_order`, but without evidence of malicious behavior, it should not increase the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - The malware scores are appropriately low. No malicious intent or behavior is evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging that external functions (`km_order`) could warrant minimal caution if their implementation is unknown.\n\n### Final Remarks:\n\nThe code is a standard scientific signal analysis toolkit. The reports are accurate in their assessments. Unless the external `km_order` function contains hidden malicious behavior (which is unlikely given its context), the overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**        | **0.0**            | **0.1**  |\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the detailed review, emphasizing the code's benign purpose and the lack of suspicious activity.",
