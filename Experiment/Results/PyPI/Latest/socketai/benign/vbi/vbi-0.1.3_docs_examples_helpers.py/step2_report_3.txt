  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details within each review.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a set of signal processing and plotting functions using standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).\n- No reports mention any suspicious data flows, external network activity, or file I/O that could indicate malicious behavior.\n- The only external function of note is `km_order` from `vbi.feature_extraction.features_utils`, which is assumed to be legitimate unless proven otherwise.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The purpose across reports is clearly scientific/data analysis, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, and the functions perform expected spectral analysis and plotting routines.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.\n- **External dependencies:** Usage of standard libraries and one external module (`km_order`). Without further info, this seems benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; no external network, file I/O, or credential handling.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports' scores for malware are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are also very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n- No report suggests any assumptions about vulnerabilities that are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- **Potential improvements:** If `km_order` is from an external source, verifying its legitimacy would be prudent, but there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only performs analysis and visualization, a higher risk score is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, primarily due to external dependencies and the nature of the code)  \n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of signal analysis and plotting functions with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The minimal security risk is justified by the lack of external communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code appears safe and legitimate for its intended scientific purpose.",
