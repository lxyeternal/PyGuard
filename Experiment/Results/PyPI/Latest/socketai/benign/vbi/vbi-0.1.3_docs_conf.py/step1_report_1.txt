  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation for the 'vbi' project.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, os, subprocess, sphinx_bootstrap_theme, and setuptools_scm; usage of get_version; modification of sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flows identified. The script primarily reads configuration and sets up environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The only subprocess call is commented out and safe. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical imports and settings. It includes some commented-out code related to C++ compilation, which is harmless. No use of untrusted inputs, no network connections, no data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The get_version function from setuptools_scm is used for versioning, which is common practice. No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal Sphinx configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no security risks or malware indications.",
