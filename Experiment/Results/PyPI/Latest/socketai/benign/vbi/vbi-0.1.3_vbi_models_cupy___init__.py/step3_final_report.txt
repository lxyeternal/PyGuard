  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), import statements",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable reading, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval/exec leading to potential malicious actions or data exfiltration",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, use of eval/exec, reading environment variables, suspicious import patterns",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that benign code (Reports 1 and 3, 5) have scores of 0 malware and obfuscated, with low security risk, aligning with their straightforward nature. Suspicious reports (2 and 4) show obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher malware (0.5-0.6) and obfuscated scores (~0.75). Slightly adjusting Report 2's malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 reflects cautious suspicion without confirmed malicious payloads. The overall risk scores are consistent with the described behaviors, emphasizing the need for further analysis of heavily obfuscated and dynamic code. The scores across all reports are appropriate and aligned with their evidence, with no overstatement or understatement of risks.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant cautious scores (~0.5 malware, ~0.75 obfuscated). No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but the techniques used justify moderate suspicion. Final scores are consistent with the evidence, emphasizing the importance of further static/dynamic analysis for suspicious cases.",
