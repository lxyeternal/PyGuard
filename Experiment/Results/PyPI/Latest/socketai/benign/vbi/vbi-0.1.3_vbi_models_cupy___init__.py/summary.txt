  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant cautious scores (~0.5 malware, ~0.75 obfuscated). No definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, but the techniques used justify moderate suspicion. Final scores are consistent with the evidence, emphasizing the importance of further static/dynamic analysis for suspicious cases."
