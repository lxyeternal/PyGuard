{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package that imports standard modules and third-party libraries, potentially to perform data processing or other functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, environment variables (if used), and possibly user inputs if present (not shown). No explicit input sources identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file system writes, or environment modifications, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code segment.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code implementing data flow, no clear source-to-sink paths are observable. The code primarily shows imports and standard definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident in the provided code. The structure appears typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements and standard Python constructs. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. It does not include network activity, credential handling, or other typical malicious behaviors. Without additional code, no malicious intent or security issues are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears standard and benign. Confidence in this assessment is high given the lack of suspicious elements.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
