  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for loading datasets, processing samples, converting code formats, performing statistical analysis, and checking dependencies and hardware information. It appears to support scientific and machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "File system reads for dataset files and model scripts; imports modules including os, time, torch, numpy, scipy, nbformat, and nbconvert; potential user inputs in function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of system commands (p2j for Python to Jupyter conversion), file writing for Jupyter notebooks and Python modules, standard output for time display, and dependency import warnings.",
  "flows": "Function get_weights/get_lengths/get_bold read files from disk; j2p uses system call to convert notebooks; other functions process data and produce numerical outputs; test_imports checks dependencies and hardware info, displaying results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for 'p2j' command can execute arbitrary commands if modulePath is manipulated, but in current code, it appears controlled. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs legitimate scientific computations and dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly involves file I/O operations, dependency imports, statistical calculations, and format conversions. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The 'os.system' call in 'p2j' could be a concern if user-controlled input were allowed, but in the given code, the function's parameter seems safe. The module imports, data handling, and conversion functions are standard and do not demonstrate suspicious activity. No data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage code is present. The 'get_cuda_info' function safely retrieves GPU info without malicious intent. Overall, the code is primarily utility and analysis functions with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs legitimate scientific and utility functions, including dataset loading, statistical analysis, dependency checks, and code format conversions. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The only minor concern is the use of 'os.system' for code conversion, which appears controlled and safe in this context.",
