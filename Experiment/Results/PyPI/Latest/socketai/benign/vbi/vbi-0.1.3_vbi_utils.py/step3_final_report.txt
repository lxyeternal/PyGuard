  "purpose": "Utility functions for data loading, timing, statistical analysis, code conversion, and environment checks in scientific workflows.",
  "sources": "File reads (np.loadtxt, np.load, np.loadz), system commands in p2j, dependency imports, environment info queries.",
  "sinks": "os.system call in p2j for script-to-notebook conversion.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to file reads and system commands; no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system in p2j could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but currently controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of benign utility functions with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the use of os.system in p2j, which executes a command based on a parameter. In the current implementation, parameters are controlled and not derived from untrusted sources. No network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage code is present. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known third-party packages. The implementation of set_diag appears flawed but not malicious. Dependency checks and environment info functions are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions for scientific computing. The only minor security concern is the use of os.system in p2j, which is controlled in current form. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
