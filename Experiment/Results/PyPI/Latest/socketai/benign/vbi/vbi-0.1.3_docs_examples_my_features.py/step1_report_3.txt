{
  "purpose": "The code defines two feature extraction functions for time series data, calculating the mean and standard deviation of regions within the series.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the parameter 'ts', which can be a numpy array or other sequence type provided as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform mathematical operations on the input data; no external or untrusted data sinks are present. No network or file I/O operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input data 'ts' flows into numpy array conversion, then through shape checks, and finally to mean or std computations. No external data or commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions are straightforward statistical computations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on converting input to numpy arrays if necessary, reshaping if the input is 1D, and computing mean or standard deviation per region. All operations are standard and involve numpy functions. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate feature extraction functions with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs simple statistical calculations on input time series data. No security threats or malware are detected.",
