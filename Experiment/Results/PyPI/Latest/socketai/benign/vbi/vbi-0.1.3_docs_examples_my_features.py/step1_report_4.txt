{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute the mean and standard deviation of regions within a time series, likely for feature extraction or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'ts' which is a numpy array or convertible to one, and possibly externally provided 'arg1' and 'arg2'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions; functions return numerical results without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'ts' flows through conversion and shape adjustments, then into numpy functions for statistical computation, returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Functions are straightforward, dummy arguments are unused, and no external communications or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for statistical features of time series data, with proper input validation and shape handling. No unsafe operations, external data leaks, or malicious code are present. The dummy arguments are unused, which is benign but suggests placeholders or incomplete feature implementations. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard numerical processing code with clear, well-structured functions. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
