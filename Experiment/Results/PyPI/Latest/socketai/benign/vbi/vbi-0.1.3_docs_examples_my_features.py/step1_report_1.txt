{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom feature extraction functions for time series data, specifically computing the mean and standard deviation per region.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the parameter 'ts', which can be a numpy array or any array-like structure provided to the functions.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks are present; the functions perform statistical calculations and return results without side effects or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'ts' flows into numpy array conversion, then into mean or std calculations, and outputs are returned as arrays and label lists.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard, with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple statistical computations on provided numpy arrays, with input validation and reshaping. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. The functions are dummy feature extractors, with no side effects or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard statistical calculations for feature extraction without any malicious intent or security risks.",
