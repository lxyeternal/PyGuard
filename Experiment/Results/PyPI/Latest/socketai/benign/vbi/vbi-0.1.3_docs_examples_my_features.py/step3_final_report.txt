{
  "purpose": "Compute the mean and standard deviation of each region in a time series dataset, serving as feature extraction functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'ts' (numpy array or array-like), possibly user-provided data; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'ts' is validated and reshaped; statistical computations are performed directly on 'ts'; results are returned as numpy arrays with labels.",
  "anomalies": "Unused dummy arguments 'arg1' and 'arg2'; no suspicious code or obfuscation; straightforward numpy operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple statistical calculations (mean and std) on input data, with input validation and shape handling. No external I/O, network calls, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are well-structured, and the dummy arguments are benign placeholders. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard statistical feature extraction without malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
