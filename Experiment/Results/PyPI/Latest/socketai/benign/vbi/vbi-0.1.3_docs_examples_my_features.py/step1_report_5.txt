{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions to compute statistical features (mean and standard deviation) over regions of a time series dataset.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ts' (time series data), 'arg1', and 'arg2'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'ts' is processed and used in numpy operations to compute mean and standard deviation; no external data or untrusted sources flow into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data type checks, reshaping, and computation of mean and standard deviation for each region in the provided time series. All operations are standard numpy functions with no malicious intent. The functions are straightforward, with no external network access, no code injection, no handling of sensitive credentials, or other malicious patterns. There are no backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of feature extraction functions for time series analysis. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks.",
