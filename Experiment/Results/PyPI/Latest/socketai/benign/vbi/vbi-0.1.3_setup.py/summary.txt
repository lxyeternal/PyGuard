  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build process for SWIG-based C++ extensions with no active malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is supply chain integrity—if interface files are compromised, malicious code could be executed during build. Implementing validation, checksums, or sandboxing can mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding external file trustworthiness."
