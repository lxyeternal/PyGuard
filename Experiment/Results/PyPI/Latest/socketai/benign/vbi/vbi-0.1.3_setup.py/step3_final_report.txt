  "purpose": "Automates discovery of SWIG interface files, generates wrappers via subprocess, and compiles C++ extensions for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory listing for *.i files, reading interface filenames, and subprocess.check_call() executing 'swig' commands.",
  "sinks": "External 'swig' command execution with interface files; potential for executing malicious code if source files are compromised.",
  "flows": "Filesystem discovery of *.i files -> subprocess call to 'swig' with interface filename -> generated wrapper files -> extension compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or sanitization of filenames or interface files; reliance on external directory contents without integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically discovers interface files and invokes 'swig' to generate wrappers, then builds extensions. It uses subprocess to run external commands based on filesystem inputs, which could be manipulated if the directory contents are malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The subprocess calls are standard for such build scripts but could pose supply chain risks if interface files are maliciously altered. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to reliance on external files and commands without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build process for SWIG-based C++ extensions with no active malicious code or backdoors. The main concern is supply chain integrity—if interface files are compromised, malicious code could be executed during build. Implementing validation, checksums, or sandboxing can mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding external file trustworthiness.",
