  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided, as the code block is empty.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are detectable due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is completely empty; no logic, functions, or statements are present. This is unusual for a functional module.",
  "analysis": "The code provided contains no executable statements, functions, or data handling. An empty code file is atypical for a legitimate package module and could indicate obfuscation, incomplete code, or an attempt to hide malicious content in other parts not provided. Without additional context or code, it's impossible to evaluate data flows or detect malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the empty code file, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The absence of code could be benign, or it could be an incomplete or intentionally obscured snippet. Further information or actual code content is needed for a thorough review.",
