  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic execution points, file/network operations, environment variables, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into dynamic execution or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code with dynamic execution, high obfuscation scores, suspicious variable naming, unusual control flow, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is evaluated for suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious activity. Reports with straightforward, benign code receive low malware and risk scores. Obfuscated code with dynamic features raises suspicion, justifying higher obfuscation and moderate malware scores. The most suspicious report (Report 3) exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks confirmed malicious actions, warranting a slightly increased malware score. Scores are cross-checked for consistency with descriptions, and minor adjustments are made to better reflect suspicion levels while avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears benign across most reports, with Report 3 showing obfuscation and dynamic features that justify moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are adjusted to reflect this nuanced assessment, maintaining high confidence in benign reports and cautious suspicion in obfuscated code.",
