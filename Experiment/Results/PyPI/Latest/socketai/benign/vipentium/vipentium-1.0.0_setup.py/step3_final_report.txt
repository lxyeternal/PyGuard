  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'vipentium', defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> defines package info -> sets CLI entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file, defines package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and an entry point for CLI. There are no dynamic code executions, external data flows, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
