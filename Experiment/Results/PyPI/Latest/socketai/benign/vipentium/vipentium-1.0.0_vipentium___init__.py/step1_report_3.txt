  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement itself is straightforward, but the module name 'vipentium_runner' may be suspicious or malicious; however, this alone does not confirm malicious intent. The code does not contain any logic, data handling, or executable statements.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports symbols from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors present. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The module name could be a red flag if related to known malware, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple import of testing components, with no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities evident.",
