  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output points are evident in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this single import statement; it only imports symbols for later use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module. It appears to be part of a test suite setup, importing decorators and classes used for testing purposes. No suspicious or malicious code is visible at this stage; the import is from a relative module, which is common in package structures. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
