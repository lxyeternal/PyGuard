  "purpose": "Import testing utilities and fixtures from a local module, likely for unit testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.vipentium_runner'. No data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import simply makes symbols available in the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, used in testing contexts. It contains no malicious code, data flows, or security vulnerabilities. The module name 'vipentium_runner' alone does not indicate malicious intent without further context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified. The module name does not raise suspicion based solely on this snippet. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent; no improvements are necessary.",
