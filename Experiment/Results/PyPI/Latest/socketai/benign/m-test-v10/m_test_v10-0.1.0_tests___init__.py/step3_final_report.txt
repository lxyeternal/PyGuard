  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code or descriptions, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
  "sources": "N/A (no code provided; analysis based on descriptions and high-level summaries)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data flows or code execution paths identified due to absence of code)",
  "flows": "N/A (no code to analyze for source-to-sink data flows)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code limits anomaly detection; some reports mention dynamic features but no malicious intent is observed",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code and do not assign high malware or obfuscation scores. The reasoning is consistent, with low confidence scores reflecting the inability to analyze code. Risk scores are conservatively low (~0.1-0.2), appropriate given the absence of suspicious activity. No false positives or overestimations are present. The scores and reasoning across reports are aligned and justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The assessments are cautious and appropriate, with scores reflecting the lack of code or suspicious patterns. No adjustments are necessary.",
