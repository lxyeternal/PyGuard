  "purpose": "Import functions is_inside_geofence and haversine_distance from a local core module, likely for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; simple import, no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic import statement importing two functions from a local module. No execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The functions suggest geospatial calculations, which are common in location-based applications. All assessments correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No corrections or adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is entirely benign, representing a standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
