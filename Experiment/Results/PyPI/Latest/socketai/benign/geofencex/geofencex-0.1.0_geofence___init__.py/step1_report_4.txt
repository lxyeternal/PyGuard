{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions related to geofencing and distance calculations, likely for location-based features.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module named .core, which may contain the core functionalities for geofence and distance calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in the provided snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks in this fragment, as it is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code appears to be standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance', from a local module. This suggests the script is related to geospatial computations. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors in this snippet. The code itself is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This fragment appears to be a benign import statement for geospatial functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this small snippet.",
