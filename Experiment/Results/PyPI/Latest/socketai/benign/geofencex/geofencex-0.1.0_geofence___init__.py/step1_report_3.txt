  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is observable from this isolated import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present in this import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of two functions from a module named 'core'. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package structure, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Since this is only an import statement, it does not execute any untrusted code or data. No security risks or malware indications are evident at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It is a standard Python module import, and no suspicious activity is detected.",
