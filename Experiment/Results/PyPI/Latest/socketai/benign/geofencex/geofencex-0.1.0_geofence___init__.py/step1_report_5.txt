{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance' from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified within this snippet as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement, likely part of a larger project. It imports functions related to geofencing calculations, which are common in location-based applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The simplicity and standard import usage suggest no security issues at this level.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import statement typical in Python projects.",
