{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'is_inside_geofence' and 'haversine_distance' from a local module 'core', likely used for geospatial calculations or location-based logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'core' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data is sent or affected beyond import.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing functions from a local module, with no data transfer or external interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement bringing in two functions from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The functions imported suggest geospatial calculations, which are common in location-based applications. Without additional code or context, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger geospatial application. No security concerns are identified based solely on this snippet.",
