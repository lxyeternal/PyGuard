  "purpose": "Import functions is_inside_geofence and haversine_distance from a local module named core, likely for geofencing and distance calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output handling shown",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only import statements present",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, simple import; no anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a standard import from a local module. No input handling, data processing, or output operations are visible. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It appears to be a part of a larger codebase for geofencing functionality.",
