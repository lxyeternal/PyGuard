  "purpose": "Calculate the distance between two geographic points and determine if a point is within a specified geofence radius.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters). Internal calculations within 'haversine_distance' and 'is_inside_geofence'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage, external network communication, or system modification. No use of untrusted data beyond parameter inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed in 'haversine_distance', with data flowing through mathematical calculations. No data flows to external systems or sensitive locations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow. The code performs standard geographic calculations with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard haversine formula to compute distances between geographic coordinates. It accepts input parameters for coordinates and radius, performs mathematical calculations to determine the distance, and checks if within a geofence. No use of external data sources, environment variables, or network operations. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for geospatial computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign geospatial calculation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for geofencing functionality.",
