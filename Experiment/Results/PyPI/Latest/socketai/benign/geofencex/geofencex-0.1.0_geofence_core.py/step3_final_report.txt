  "purpose": "Calculate the great circle distance between two geographic points and determine if a point lies within a specified geofence radius.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, user_lat, user_lon, center_lat, center_lon, radius_meters",
  "sinks": "Return value of is_inside_geofence indicating whether the user location is within the geofence",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are converted to radians, used in haversine_distance to compute distance, which is then compared to radius_meters in is_inside_geofence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for geospatial calculations",
  "analysis": "The code implements the standard haversine formula to compute the distance between two points on Earth. It then checks if this distance is within a specified radius to determine geofence inclusion. The implementation is clear, with no external dependencies or suspicious constructs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's logic is correct and typical for such geospatial tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geospatial distance calculation and geofence checking. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified. The reports, especially report 4, support this conclusion. No modifications are necessary.",
