  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of geospatial distance calculation and geofence checking. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified. The reports, especially report 4, support this conclusion. No modifications are necessary."
