  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models to be inherited by other database models.",
  "sources": "Import of DeclarativeBase from sqlalchemy.orm, and class definition inheriting from DeclarativeBase.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink since the code only defines a class with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DeclarativeBase from SQLAlchemy ORM, then creates a subclass Base that inherits from DeclarativeBase. This pattern is typical for SQLAlchemy model base classes. No input/output, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The code serves as a foundational class for ORM models and does not perform any operations or contain malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard boilerplate for SQLAlchemy models with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is minimal, well-structured, and safe.",
