  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models to inherit common configuration and behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement for DeclarativeBase from sqlalchemy.orm, and class declaration for Base.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a class without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the DeclarativeBase class from SQLAlchemy, then defines a new class 'Base' that inherits from it. It serves as a base class for ORM models. There are no data inputs, no external communications, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for setting up SQLAlchemy models and contains no indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard boilerplate for SQLAlchemy models with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
