  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models to be inherited by other database models.",

  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard SQLAlchemy class and declares an empty subclass, serving as a common base for models. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or data leaks. The code appears to be a minimal, conventional ORM base class definition with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and benign setup for SQLAlchemy models with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
