  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for SQLAlchemy setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DeclarativeBase from SQLAlchemy ORM and defines a simple subclass called Base, intended as a superclass for all database models. There are no functions, data processing, or external data inputs. The code is minimal and standard for setting up ORM base classes. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
