  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models to be used as a parent class for database models.",
  "sources": "Import of DeclarativeBase from sqlalchemy.orm",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output that could leak data",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely defines a class without any data flow or runtime execution beyond class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports DeclarativeBase from SQLAlchemy ORM and defines an empty subclass named Base that inherits from DeclarativeBase. It serves as a common parent for ORM models. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign base class definition for SQLAlchemy models. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
