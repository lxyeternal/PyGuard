  "purpose": "Define a base class for SQLAlchemy ORM models using DeclarativeBase.",
  "sources": "Import of DeclarativeBase from sqlalchemy.orm",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class definition that imports DeclarativeBase and creates a subclass Base. It contains no data flows, input/output, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. It serves as a boilerplate for ORM models. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or security-related behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with confidence 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SQLAlchemy ORM base class definition with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
