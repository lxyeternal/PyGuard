  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe based on the provided analyses. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security risks. It is advisable to maintain the current scores, but for a more conservative stance, the security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 where appropriate. Overall, the dependency poses minimal security concern under current assessment."
