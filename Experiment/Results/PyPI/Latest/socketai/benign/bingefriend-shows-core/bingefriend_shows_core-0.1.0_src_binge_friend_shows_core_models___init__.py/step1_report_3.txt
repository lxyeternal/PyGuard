  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided as the code block is empty, so the function or intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit data input sources such as user input, network calls, or file reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no suspicious sinks such as network transmission, file modification, or system command execution identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable due to the absence of code elements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely empty; no operations, variables, or functions are present. This is unusual and may indicate an obfuscated or incomplete module.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no executable content, making it impossible to analyze for security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies. The lack of code could suggest an obfuscation attempt, an incomplete snippet, or an intentionally empty module. Given the absence of logic, there are no signs of malware or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is empty and contains no logic or data flows. No malicious activity or security issues can be identified. Further context or code is needed for a meaningful review.",
