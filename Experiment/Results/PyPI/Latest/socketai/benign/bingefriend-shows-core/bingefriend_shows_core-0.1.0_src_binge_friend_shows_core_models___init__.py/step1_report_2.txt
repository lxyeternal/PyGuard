{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a Python module that may perform data processing or manipulation, possibly for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially external resources such as network calls or files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, system commands, file writes, or data returned to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, system, storage).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code structure appears typical and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python features. It reads inputs via parameters and environment variables, processes data with standard functions, and outputs or performs actions based on that data. No suspicious network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration methods are evident. The lack of hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual constructs suggests no malicious intent. The code lacks complex obfuscation, misleading variable names, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign, standard Python implementation with no malicious activity detected.",
