  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sockets, system commands, potential dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network or system commands; dynamic code execution may process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded addresses, suspicious network activity, and potential data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious patterns in reports 1, 3, and 4, with straightforward logic and no obfuscation. Report 2 shows minor obfuscation but no malicious payloads, aligning with low malware suspicion. Report 5 demonstrates multiple malicious indicators such as eval()/exec(), network communication with suspicious endpoints, obfuscation, and potential data leaks, justifying higher scores. The overall scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with low overall risk and suspicion except for report 5. Static analysis confirms the scores' appropriateness, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; report 5 indicates significant malicious activity justifying higher scores. The provided scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, reflecting a generally low threat level with isolated high-suspicion indicators.",
