  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show season, mapping database columns and relationships.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines class attributes for database columns and relationships.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines data structures and relationships, no data flow logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or code execution. No use of environment variables or external data sources within the model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model with attributes mapped to database columns and relationships to other models. It uses type hints, mapped_column, and relationship() appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. All imported modules are standard, and the class only defines schema without any runtime logic. No suspicious patterns, hidden code, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for a 'Season' entity with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger application for managing TV show data.",
