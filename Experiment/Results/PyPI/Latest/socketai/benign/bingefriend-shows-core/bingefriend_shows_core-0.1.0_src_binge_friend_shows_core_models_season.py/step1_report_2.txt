{
  "purpose": "Define an SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV season, including attributes and relationships to other models.",
  "sources": "Imports from Python standard library (datetime, typing), SQLAlchemy modules, and local base class. Class attributes including mapped columns and relationships.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data, as this is a data model definition. No data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - this code does not process data but defines data structures and relationships.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. Relationships and attributes appear standard for an ORM model. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM class defining a 'Season' table with various columns and relationships to other models ('Network', 'Show', 'Episode'). No input/output handling, external network calls, or code execution found. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The import statements and class attributes are typical for database models, and the code lacks any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ORM model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply models the data structure for a TV season in a database context.",
