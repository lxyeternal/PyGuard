{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'season' entity in a TV show database.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQLAlchemy column definitions and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with a database through SQLAlchemy ORM; no direct untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. The code is straightforward ORM schema.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class 'Season' extending Base, and specifies ORM mappings for database columns and relationships. No input handling, user input, or external data processing occurs within this snippet. No suspicious or malicious code such as network communication, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms is present. The code strictly models database schema for a TV season, using SQLAlchemy best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM schema definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply models data for a 'season' entity in a database, with no indications of malware or security threats.",
