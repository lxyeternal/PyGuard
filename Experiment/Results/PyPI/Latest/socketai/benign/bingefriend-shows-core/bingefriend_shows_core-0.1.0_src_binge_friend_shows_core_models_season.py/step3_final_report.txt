  "purpose": "Defines the 'Season' entity for a TV show database using SQLAlchemy ORM, specifying attributes and relationships.",
  "sources": "Attribute assignments and relationship definitions within the class; no external data inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only models database schema without data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - schema definition without data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward schema with standard patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM model for a 'Season' with attributes like id, maze_id, url, number, name, dates, and relationships to network, show, and episodes. It uses typical SQLAlchemy constructs with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of zero, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe ORM schema for a TV show's season entity, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
