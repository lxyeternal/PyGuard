  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'seasons' table in a TV show database.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, SQLAlchemy modules, and relative imports for base class and related models.",
  "sinks": "Database schema definition, attribute assignment, relationship configuration.",
  "flows": "Imports → class definition → attribute and relationship setup → database table mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition for a TV show season. It imports necessary modules, defines attributes with appropriate data types, and sets up relationships with other models. All attribute values are standard schema definitions, and there are no inputs, external data sources, or untrusted data handling. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SQLAlchemy model for a database schema with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to map the 'seasons' table and establish relationships with related entities. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
