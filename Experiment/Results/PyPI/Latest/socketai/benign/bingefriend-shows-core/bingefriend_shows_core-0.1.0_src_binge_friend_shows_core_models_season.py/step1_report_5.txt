  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV season, including attributes and relationships to other models.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and SQLAlchemy components; class attributes defining columns and relationships.",
  "sinks": "Database schema definitions and relationship mappings; no direct data sinks or output points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions to database schema, with potential input from related models, but no untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition for a 'Season' entity using SQLAlchemy. It imports standard libraries and modules, defines columns with appropriate types and constraints, and sets up relationships with other models. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communications, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code adheres to typical ORM patterns and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected based on the class structure and imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'Season'. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for normal database schema mapping purposes.",
