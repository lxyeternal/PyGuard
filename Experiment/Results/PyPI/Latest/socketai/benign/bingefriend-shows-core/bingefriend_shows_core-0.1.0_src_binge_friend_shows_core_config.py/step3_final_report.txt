  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, network sources, dynamic code execution points ('exec', 'eval').",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, dynamic code execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, potentially leading to network/file sinks or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of 'exec'/'eval', obfuscation patterns, hardcoded secrets suspected in some reports, but no concrete malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "Most reports show no overt malicious activity, with sources and sinks indicating typical data flows. Suspicion arises mainly from report 5, which mentions dynamic execution and obfuscation without providing code. Scores for malware and obfuscation are generally low, aligning with the limited evidence. Confidence levels are moderate, reflecting cautious assessment. The potential for hidden behaviors warrants ongoing monitoring, especially for report 5's indications of obfuscation and dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Slight suspicion in report 5 suggests a need for further static/dynamic analysis. The security risk remains low but should be monitored due to potential obfuscation and dynamic execution hints.",
