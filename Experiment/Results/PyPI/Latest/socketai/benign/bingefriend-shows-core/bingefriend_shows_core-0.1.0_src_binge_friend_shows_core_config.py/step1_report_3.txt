  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or functionality in Python, but without the actual code snippet, the specific purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Any user input functions, environment variable reads, file reads, or network requests (specific sources cannot be determined without the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or data processing functions. Specific sinks cannot be pinpointed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly passing through variables or functions that could be exploited if untrusted data is involved. Exact flows are unclear without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without viewing the actual code. Need more information to determine suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient data; no code provided for detailed step-by-step analysis. Cannot determine source-to-sink flows or anomalies without the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the absence of the code snippet, a definitive assessment cannot be made. No obvious malicious patterns are observable without further details.",
