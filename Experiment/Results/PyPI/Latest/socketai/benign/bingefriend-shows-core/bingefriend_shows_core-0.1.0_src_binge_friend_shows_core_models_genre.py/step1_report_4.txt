  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a genre entity, including attributes and relationships.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy components and type checking, class attribute definitions, relationship configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data interactions present in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code sets up static ORM models without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLAlchemy ORM class 'Genre' with attributes 'id' and 'name', and a relationship 'show_genres'. It imports standard libraries and uses conventional ORM patterns. No data input, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure appears clean, typical of a database model, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model for representing genres in a database. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It is safe and serves a straightforward purpose of defining a database schema.",
