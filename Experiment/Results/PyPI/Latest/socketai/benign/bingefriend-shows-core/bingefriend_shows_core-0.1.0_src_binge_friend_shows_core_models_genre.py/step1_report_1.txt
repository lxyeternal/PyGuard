  "purpose": "Define an SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'genres' table, representing a genre entity with relationships to shows.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing, SQLAlchemy modules, and local base class; class definition and attribute declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this code; potential data leaks could occur if this model's data is improperly handled elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Model attributes and relationships define the data structure, but no data flow or input handling is present here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. Code is straightforward ORM model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model with proper typing, relationship setup, and documentation. It includes conditional import for type checking. No external data handling, user input, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a typical data model without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SQLAlchemy model definition for a 'Genre' entity with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The structure and content are typical for database models.",
