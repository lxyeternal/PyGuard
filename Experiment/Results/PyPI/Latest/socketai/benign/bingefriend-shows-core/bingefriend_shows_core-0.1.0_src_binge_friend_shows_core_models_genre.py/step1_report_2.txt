  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'genre' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, imports, and type hints from SQLAlchemy and local modules.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the database via SQLAlchemy ORM, but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Class attributes are mapped to database columns, and relationships are established with other models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Relationship cascade options are standard. The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a SQLAlchemy model class 'Genre' with attributes for primary key and name, and establishes a relationship with 'ShowGenre'. It uses type hints and ORM declarative syntax properly. No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious logic detected. The structure is clean, and the code's purpose is to define a database schema component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model definition for a 'genre'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for database schema management.",
