{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'genre' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sqlalchemy', 'typing', and local module '.base'. The class definition reads class attributes and relationships.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily defines data structure and relationships; no sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions to ORM mapping, with relationships linking to other models ('ShowGenre'). No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward ORM model definition with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a 'Genre' class extending 'Base', and specifies table name, columns, and relationships. The use of 'Mapped' and 'mapped_column' adheres to SQLAlchemy standards. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The relationship setup appears standard, referencing 'ShowGenre' with proper cascade options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy model for 'Genre' with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as part of a data schema definition without any malicious intent or security flaws.",
