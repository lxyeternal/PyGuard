  "purpose": "Defines a 'Genre' entity for a database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes 'id' and 'name', and the relationship 'show_genres'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions flow into ORM mappings; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard ORM model with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model for 'Genre' with attributes 'id' and 'name', and a relationship to 'ShowGenre'. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, or network operations. The code is syntactically correct, with proper typing and relationship setup. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, typical ORM schema code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its role as a simple data model. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ORM model with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
