  "purpose": "Define a many-to-many association between shows and genres using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Database foreign keys 'shows.id' and 'genres.id', ORM relationship attributes",
  "sinks": "Relationships referencing 'Show' and 'Genre' models, ORM back_populates attributes",
  "flows": "Foreign key fields 'show_id' and 'genre_id' flow into relationships 'show'/'genre' and 'shows'/'genres'",
  "anomalies": "Presence of both singular and plural relationship attributes ('show' and 'shows', 'genre' and 'genres') which may cause ORM confusion or redundancy",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM model with primary key and foreign keys, establishing relationships with 'Show' and 'Genre'. However, it defines both singular and plural relationships ('show' and 'shows', 'genre' and 'genres') with the same 'back_populates' values, which is inconsistent and potentially problematic. This redundancy could lead to ORM misconfiguration or runtime errors. The code contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling. The foreign keys and relationships are typical ORM constructs, but the relationship naming should be clarified or simplified. The malware score is correctly 0; the obfuscated score is 0; the security risk score could be slightly increased due to ORM relationship ambiguity, but overall remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ORM schema with a minor issue in relationship naming conventions. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the redundant relationship attributes which could be simplified for clarity and correctness. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 to reflect potential ORM configuration ambiguity.",
