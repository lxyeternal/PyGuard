  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a show-genre association table in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports SQLAlchemy modules and types; reads class attributes for ORM mapping.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "The class attributes define schema mappings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. Relationships are standard ORM references.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for ORM definition, defines a class for a many-to-many relationship table, and establishes foreign key constraints and relationships with related models. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, secret data, or hidden backdoors. It does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. It appears to be a clean, conventional ORM model definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQLAlchemy model defining relationships between shows and genres. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a safe and typical ORM setup for relational data mapping.",
