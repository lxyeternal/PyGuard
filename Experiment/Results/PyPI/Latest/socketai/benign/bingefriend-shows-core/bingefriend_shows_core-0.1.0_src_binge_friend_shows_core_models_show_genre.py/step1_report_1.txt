  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for associating shows and genres in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and SQLAlchemy modules; data definitions for model attributes and relationships.",
  "sinks": "Potentially related to database interactions via SQLAlchemy ORM methods.",
  "flows": "Model attributes (show_id, genre_id) flow into database queries or commands, relationships facilitate ORM object navigation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior; use of standard SQLAlchemy patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a SQLAlchemy model with proper foreign keys and relationships, and avoids dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are present. The relationships are standard ORM associations, and the model's purpose aligns with normal database modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate SQLAlchemy ORM model for managing show-genre relationships without any malicious intent or security risks.",
