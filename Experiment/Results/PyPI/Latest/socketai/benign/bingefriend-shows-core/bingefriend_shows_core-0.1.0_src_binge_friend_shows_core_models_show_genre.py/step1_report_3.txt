  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy model for associating shows and genres in a database schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from SQLAlchemy, and the class attributes defining table columns and relationships.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data input or output is evident.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up data model relationships and does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic are present. Relationship definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a database model using SQLAlchemy with standard ORM patterns. It imports necessary modules, declares a class with table attributes, and sets up relationships to other models. No user input processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code appears to serve as a straightforward schema definition without any embedded or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for a show-genre association table. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and normal.",
