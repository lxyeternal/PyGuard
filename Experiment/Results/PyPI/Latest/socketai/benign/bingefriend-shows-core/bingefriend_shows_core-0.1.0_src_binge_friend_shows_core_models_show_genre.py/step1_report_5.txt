  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, and relationship configurations.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions via SQLAlchemy ORM methods, foreign key constraints, and relationship mappings.",
  "flows": "Class attributes and relationships define data flow from show and genre entities through foreign keys and ORM relationships.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, and no unusual or obfuscated code present. The code appears standard for an ORM model.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a SQLAlchemy ORM model class 'ShowGenre' with primary key and foreign key attributes. It sets up relationships to 'Show' and 'Genre' models, including bidirectional back_populates references. No user input, external data handling, or potentially unsafe code constructs are present. The code is straightforward ORM mapping without malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model for a show-genre association with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It correctly sets up database relationships without including any malicious or harmful code. Overall, it appears safe.",
