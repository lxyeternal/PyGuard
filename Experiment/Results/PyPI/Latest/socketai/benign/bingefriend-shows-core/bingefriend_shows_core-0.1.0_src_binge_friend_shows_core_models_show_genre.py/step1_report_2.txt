  "purpose": "Defines a SQLAlchemy ORM model for associating shows with genres in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, including ForeignKey and relationship; reads class attributes and relationships.",
  "sinks": "Database schema definitions and ORM relationships; no direct data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Code reads model attribute definitions and relationships, no flow of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. Relationships are standard ORM constructs. No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining a many-to-many relationship between shows and genres. It uses standard imports, type hints, and relationship configurations. No untrusted data sources, external data handling, or potentially malicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve its intended purpose of database schema modeling without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ORM model definition with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and functions as expected for schema representation.",
