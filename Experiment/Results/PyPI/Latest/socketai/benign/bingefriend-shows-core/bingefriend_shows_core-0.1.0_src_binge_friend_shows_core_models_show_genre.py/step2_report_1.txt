  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: The report states that the code is a standard ORM model with no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n   - **Verdict**: The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical ORM patterns.\n   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is a typical ORM model with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n   - **Verdict**: Consistent and reasonable.\n   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Again, confirms standard ORM setup with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n   - **Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar conclusion; the code is a typical ORM model with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n   - **Note**: The security risk score is set to 0.1, which is very low and acceptable for a schema definition.\n   - **Verdict**: Consistent.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as others; standard ORM pattern with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n   - **Note**: The low security risk score is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Analysis**:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard ORM model with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1), reflecting the minimal risk associated with schema definition code.\n\n**My Final Assessment**:\n- The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (reflecting minimal security concern, typical for schema code)\n\nThis thorough review confirms that the code is benign and well-understood.",
