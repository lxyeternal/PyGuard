{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show with attributes and relationships to other models.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as url, external IDs, image URLs, and summary which may contain user input or external data; relationship definitions that link to other models.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as database execution commands or network transmissions are present; model definitions alone do not execute data handling.",
  "flows": "The model specifies data structure but does not include data flows or untrusted data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No evidence of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. Relationships and attribute definitions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy model defining a 'shows' table with various fields and relationships. The attributes are standard data fields with typical data types, and the relationships connect to other models like Episode, Network, Season, and ShowGenre. The use of typing.TYPE_CHECKING helps prevent circular imports. No external data processing, code execution, or network activity is embedded. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the code appears to be intended for defining database schema only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard ORM model definition without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It focuses on data structure and relationships, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
