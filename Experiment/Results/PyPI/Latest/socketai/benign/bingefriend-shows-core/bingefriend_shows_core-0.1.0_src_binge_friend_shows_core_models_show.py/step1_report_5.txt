{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show, including its attributes and relationships to other models.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute definitions for the Show class, imports modules, and references related models via type hints and relationship definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if data from external sources is stored without validation, but there are no explicit data sinks such as network calls or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (attributes possibly set with external data) through ORM mappings and relationships, but no untrusted input handling or external data flow is explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code strictly defines a data model with no runtime code that executes or processes external data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class with ORM mappings, and sets relationships with other models. There is no code execution, dynamic code, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward model definition for a database schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and contains no malicious intent.",
