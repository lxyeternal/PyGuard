  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for storing information about TV shows in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, datetime, and sqlalchemy modules; class attributes for show data; relationships to other models.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code primarily sets up database schema and relationships.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues; this is schema definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; the code appears to be standard ORM schema setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a SQLAlchemy model for a 'show' with various attributes. It uses typing annotations and SQLAlchemy column definitions appropriately. Relationships to other models are defined, but there is no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or insecure practices. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. Overall, this is a straightforward schema definition without malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show entity, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
