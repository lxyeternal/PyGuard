  "purpose": "Define the database schema for a TV show entity using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as id, maze_id, url, name, type, language, status, runtime, premiere and end dates, schedule info, network_id, external IDs, images, summary, and updated timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Relationships to seasons, episodes, network, and show genres; no external sinks or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to ORM attribute assignments and relationship mappings; no external data or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining a 'shows' table with various attributes and relationships. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing that could be malicious. The code structure is standard, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. All signals point to benign schema definition with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ORM schema for a TV show entity. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0, reflecting the low inherent risk of schema definitions.",
