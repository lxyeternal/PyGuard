  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code does not include any external data handling, network communication, or dynamic execution.\n- Attributes and relationships are typical for such a schema.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: a straightforward ORM model.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- None identified. The code appears correct and well-structured.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is justified.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the context.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, data exfiltration, or vulnerabilities are detected, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is acceptable for schema definitions that might be exposed if misused, but not inherently risky.\n\n### Claims about vulnerabilities:\n- All reports correctly dismiss potential vulnerabilities as they are just schema definitions.\n- No assumptions are made about untrusted data processing or external threats.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores align with the descriptions and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given the schema nature but acknowledging potential misuse if external data is improperly handled)\n\n**Note:** Since this is purely a schema definition, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show entity. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reported analysis is accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- No further action needed.",
