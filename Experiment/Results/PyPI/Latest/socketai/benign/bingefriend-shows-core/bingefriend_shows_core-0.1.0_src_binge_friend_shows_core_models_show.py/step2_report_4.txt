  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show, with attributes and relationships.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are mentioned.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- The attributes and relationships are standard for such a schema.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears correct and free of malicious content.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The security risk score is minimal or zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code or the reasoning of the reports.\n- The reports' conclusions about the benign nature of the code are justified.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0 or near zero.\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The highest securityRisk score is 0.1 in report 4, which is acceptable for a schema definition, as it might be a conservative estimate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data structures, with no runtime logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed to be 0 in all reports; this is appropriate.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The code relies on external models (Episode, Network, etc.) but does not include their code; assuming they are standard and safe.\n- No external data is processed insecurely, and no code injection or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured ORM schema.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 for conservative estimate)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.",
