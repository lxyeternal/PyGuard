  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a TV show entity, including its attributes and relationships to other models.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as 'url', 'externals_imdb', 'image_medium', 'image_original', and 'summary' are potential data sources. The code reads data for model instantiation and database operations.",
  "sinks": "Database insert/update operations, potentially influenced by the provided attribute values. No explicit untrusted input processing or external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly from external sources or user input) flows into model attributes, then into database operations. No external data flows or network communication are directly evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard SQLAlchemy ORM practices. No dynamic code execution or unsafe handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard SQLAlchemy ORM class with fields representing show details. It uses type hints and relationship mappings to other models. All attributes are typical data fields with appropriate data types and constraints. Relationships are set up correctly with back_populates and cascade options. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward data model definition for ORM purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious SQLAlchemy ORM model definition for a TV show entity. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It functions purely as a data schema for database interactions.",
