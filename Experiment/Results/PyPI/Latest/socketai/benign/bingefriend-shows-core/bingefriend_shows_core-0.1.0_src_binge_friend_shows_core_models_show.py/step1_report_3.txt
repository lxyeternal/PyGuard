  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'shows' table in a database.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data directly; it defines database schema.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code solely defines a class structure for database ORM mapping; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard ORM model definitions; no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy model class for 'shows', with attribute definitions, optional relationships, and imports. No external input handling, no code execution, no dynamic code, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. The structure follows common ORM practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The imports, attribute definitions, and relationships appear legitimate for a media database schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ORM model definition for a TV show database table. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
