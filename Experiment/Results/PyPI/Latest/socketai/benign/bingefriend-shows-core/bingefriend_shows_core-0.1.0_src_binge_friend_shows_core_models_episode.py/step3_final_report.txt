  "purpose": "Define the SQLAlchemy ORM model for an 'Episode' entity in a media database schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and local modules; class attribute definitions for database columns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no runtime data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Static class attribute definitions mapping to database columns; relationships to 'Season' and 'Show' models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; code is purely declarative schema.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM model defining an 'Episode' with various attributes, foreign key constraints, and relationships. It uses typical SQLAlchemy constructs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code's purpose is schema definition, and it does not perform any runtime actions or external communications. The imported modules are from standard and local sources, with no external untrusted dependencies. The absence of dynamic code, network activity, or embedded secrets indicates a benign, well-structured schema. All indicators point to a non-malicious, safe code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ORM schema for an 'Episode' entity with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the static, declarative nature of the code.",
