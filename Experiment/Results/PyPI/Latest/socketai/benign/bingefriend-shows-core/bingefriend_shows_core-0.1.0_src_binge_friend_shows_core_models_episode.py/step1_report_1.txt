  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for storing episode information in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (datetime, typing), SQLAlchemy modules, and relative import of Base; class attributes for episode data.",
  "sinks": "Database columns where data is stored, primarily the mapped columns.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (potentially external data assigning to model fields) to database storage through ORM mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward ORM model with attributes mapped to database columns, including foreign key relationships. It uses standard SQLAlchemy practices without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or hidden behaviors. The imports are standard and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ORM model for episodes, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for data storage.",
