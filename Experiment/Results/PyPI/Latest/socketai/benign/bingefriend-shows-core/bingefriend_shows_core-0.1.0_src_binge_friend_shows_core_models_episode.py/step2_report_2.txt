  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining an 'Episode' entity.\n   - It uses standard imports, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious strings are present.\n   - The code serves solely as a database schema definition.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.\n   - They do not identify any logical flaws or security issues.\n   - The reasoning is consistent: the code is a typical ORM model with no malicious elements.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, schema-only nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static code analysis.\n   - This is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured ORM model for episodes, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the static nature of the code.",
