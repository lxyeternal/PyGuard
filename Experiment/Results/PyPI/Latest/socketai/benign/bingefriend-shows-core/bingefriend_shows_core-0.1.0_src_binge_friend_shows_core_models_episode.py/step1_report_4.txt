{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for storing episode data in a database.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, type annotations, and the class definition for ORM mapping.",
  "sinks": "Database schema creation and ORM operations; no data output or external network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up a data model without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns observed. No evidence of backdoors or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward SQLAlchemy model with standard attribute mappings and relationships. It imports necessary modules, defines the 'Episode' class with various fields representing episode details, and establishes foreign key relationships. The code appears to be a typical ORM model setup without any dynamic code execution, data handling from external sources, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious intent. The use of type annotations and relationship mappings is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign ORM model definition for episodes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a schema for database storage without any suspicious operations or malicious intent.",
