  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for episodes in a TV show database.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, particularly SQLAlchemy components and base class, and defines class attributes for database columns.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code; no data leaks or external data output points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a data model definition with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and SQLAlchemy modules, then defines an ORM class 'Episode' with mapped columns representing various attributes of an episode. There are no external inputs, environment variable uses, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The relationships to 'Season' and 'Show' are standard ORM relationships. No embedded or obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is apparent. The model appears intended for database schema definition only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SQLAlchemy ORM model for a database table representing TV show episodes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard data schema definition with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
