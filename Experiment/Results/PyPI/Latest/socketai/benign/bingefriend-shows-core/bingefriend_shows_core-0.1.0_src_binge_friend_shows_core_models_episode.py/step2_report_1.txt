  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Review of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard SQLAlchemy ORM model defining an 'Episode' with various attributes, foreign key relationships, and no dynamic or external code execution.\n- Imports are from standard libraries and local modules; no external untrusted sources or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code serves solely as a schema definition for database storage.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They consistently note the absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risks are scored as 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no runtime data flow that could be exploited.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n\n**Final considerations:**\n\n- Since the code is a simple ORM model, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n- The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign ORM schema definition with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is safe, and the review confirms no security concerns.",
