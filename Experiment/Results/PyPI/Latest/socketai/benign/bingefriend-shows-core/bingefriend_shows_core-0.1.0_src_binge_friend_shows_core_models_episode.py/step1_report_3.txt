{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for representing TV show episodes in a database.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (datetime, typing), SQLAlchemy modules, and local base module. No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Database schema definition; no sinks involving data output or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Code defines class structure and ORM mappings; no runtime data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly models data structure without performing data processing or external actions.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly defines an ORM model with attributes mapped to database columns. It uses standard SQLAlchemy features for defining primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships. No code execution, external network calls, or data manipulation occurs that could be malicious. The imports are from standard and local modules; no external untrusted sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. It appears as a typical data model class with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining the structure of an 'Episode' entity. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any external actions or handle untrusted data beyond defining schema structure.",
