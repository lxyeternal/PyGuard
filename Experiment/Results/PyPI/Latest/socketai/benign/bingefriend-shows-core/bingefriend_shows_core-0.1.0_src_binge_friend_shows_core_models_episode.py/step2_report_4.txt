  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model defining an 'Episode' entity.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code uses standard practices: imports, type annotations, relationships, foreign keys, and column definitions.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated strings, or dynamic code execution.\n- Relationships to 'Season' and 'Show' are typical ORM constructs.\n- The attributes and foreign keys align with standard schema design.\n- The import statements are from standard libraries and local modules; no external untrusted sources.\n- The absence of any data input/output, network calls, or external dependencies reduces the risk profile.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no claims are based on assumptions.\n- The code's purpose is purely schema definition, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe ORM model.\n- The scores assigned (obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a benign, well-structured ORM model with no security concerns.",
