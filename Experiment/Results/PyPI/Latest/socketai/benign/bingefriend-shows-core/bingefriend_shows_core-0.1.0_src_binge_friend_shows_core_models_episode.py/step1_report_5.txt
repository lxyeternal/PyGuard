  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for episodes in a TV show database.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and SQLAlchemy components; attribute definitions for the Episode class.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, as this is a model definition without data processing or external I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly present; this code primarily defines data structure. No source-to-sink paths for untrusted data are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward ORM model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for datetime handling and SQLAlchemy ORM. It defines a class 'Episode' with various attributes mapping to database columns, including primary key, foreign keys, and optional fields. Relationships to 'Season' and 'Show' models are established. There are no data input/output operations, network calls, or executable code that could be malicious. The structure adheres to standard ORM patterns without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for database schema mapping. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a benign and typical implementation for a data model in a web application.",
