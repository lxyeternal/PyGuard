{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'Network' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, imports from libraries, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Database interactions via ORM mappings; no external untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; the code primarily defines schema structure without data flow from user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy model definition with proper type annotations and relationships. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with mapped columns, and relationships to other models. There are no signs of malicious code, external data leaks, or obfuscated logic. The code's purpose is purely to set up a database schema for networks, with no external communication, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard ORM model definition without any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured and safe.",
