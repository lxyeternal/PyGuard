  "purpose": "Define an SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'Network' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and attribute definitions, and imports modules for ORM and type hints.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no user input handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines schema structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns observed. Relationship attributes are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition with type annotations and relationship mappings. It imports necessary modules, declares attributes with proper ORM mapping, and sets up relationships with other models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. It does not handle external input, nor does it execute dynamic code or manage secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign SQLAlchemy model definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
