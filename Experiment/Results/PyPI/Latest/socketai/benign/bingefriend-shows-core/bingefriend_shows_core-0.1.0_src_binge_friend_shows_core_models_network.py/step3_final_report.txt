  "purpose": "Define a 'Network' entity schema for SQLAlchemy ORM with attributes and relationships.",
  "sources": "None; static schema attributes defined via mapped_column.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None; schema attributes are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard ORM patterns and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple ORM model defining a 'Network' with primary key, unique maze_id, optional string attributes, and relationships to 'Show' and 'Season'. No dynamic code, external input, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security flaws. The relationships are standard, and the code is well-structured. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ORM schema with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
