  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'Network' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, import statements, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a vulnerable way.",
  "flows": "Input data (attributes) are mapped to database columns; relationships link to other models, with no external data flow or untrusted sources evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM class definition for a network entity. It includes type annotations, relationship mappings, and import statements for type checking. There are no indications of external input handling, user data processing, or any insecure coding practices. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code serves a straightforward purpose of modeling data structure with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical ORM model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
