  "purpose": "Define an SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'network' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "Imported modules for typing and SQLAlchemy ORM components; no external or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems; the code primarily defines a data model without executing external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up class attributes and relationships.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The relationships for 'shows' and 'seasons' are consistent with ORM practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model definition, using standard typing, relationships, and attribute definitions. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears clean and typical for ORM models. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ORM model definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply models database relationships for a 'network' entity.",
