  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for a 'network' entity in a database schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, sqlalchemy, and local modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None in this code; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is only defining a data model without processing untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs; the code is standard ORM model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type hints and SQLAlchemy ORM, defines a 'Network' class with attributes mapping to database columns, and establishes relationships to other models. No input reading, no network communication, and no data leaks are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model definition for a 'network' entity. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured data model without any malicious intent.",
