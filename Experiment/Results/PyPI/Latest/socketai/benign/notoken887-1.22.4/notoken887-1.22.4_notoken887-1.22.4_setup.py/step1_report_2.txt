  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data defined in the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org', which may suggest malicious intent or malicious branding; no other anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. No malicious code or behavior is present. The author and email information is publicly visible and may be suspicious due to content but is not malicious code. The package name and description do not indicate malicious intent. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The only notable aspect is the potentially malicious or provocative contact info.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a straightforward package configuration with no malicious code. The use of suspicious contact info may indicate malicious intent or just provocative choices but does not affect code security. Overall, there is no malware or security risk detected.",
