  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data defined within the setup() function: package name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data from external sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only defines package metadata and configuration, with no data flow or execution of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The email address 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspiciously inappropriate and unprofessional, potentially indicative of malicious intent or an attempt to associate malicious branding.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no logic, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The only notable point is the author email address, which is unprofessional and potentially malicious in context. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration with a suspicious email address that could be considered unprofessional or malicious in intent. No malicious code or behavior is detected within this file, but the author’s choice of email raises concerns about the package’s trustworthiness.",
