  "conclusion": "The package contains no malicious code or obfuscation. Metadata such as author email and URL are suspicious but do not constitute security threats within the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. The risk score could be conservatively set around 0.2, considering metadata concerns. Overall, the code is benign with metadata red flags that warrant further review but do not imply active malicious behavior."
