  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata without dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author_email and url; no data input sources or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') considered unprofessional and potentially malicious metadata, but no code-based anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The suspicious contact info and URL do not influence code behavior but raise metadata concerns. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation score is 0. Risk score varies from 0.1 to 0.4 across reports, reflecting suspicion about metadata but no actual threat. The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The primary concern is metadata suspicion, not code-based malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains no malicious code or obfuscation. Metadata such as author email and URL are suspicious but do not constitute security threats within the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. The risk score could be conservatively set around 0.2, considering metadata concerns. Overall, the code is benign with metadata red flags that warrant further review but do not imply active malicious behavior.",
