  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens using substitution tables.",
  "sources": "The input data is the variable ENCTOKEN, which appears to be a token string that may contain sensitive information.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted and decrypted token outputs are printed, which could potentially expose sensitive tokens if logs are accessed.",
  "flows": "ENCTOKEN is input into the encrypt method, which transforms it; the result is then decrypted back, revealing the original token. The data flows from input variable through transformations to output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "The token appears to be a JWT-like string; the encryption scheme is very simple (substitution of 'M' with 'x' and vice versa), which is insecure for sensitive data. No external network activity, credentials, or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher with limited mapping, primarily swapping 'M' with 'x'. It processes a token string but does not perform any cryptographically secure encryption. The token, which resembles a JWT, is transformed and then reverted, serving mainly as an obfuscation. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration present. The printing of tokens could leak sensitive data if logs are stored insecurely, but this is not inherently malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform simple token obfuscation without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities beyond insecure token handling through basic substitution. The implementation is trivial and not secure for protecting sensitive tokens, but there is no evidence of malicious or harmful behavior.",
