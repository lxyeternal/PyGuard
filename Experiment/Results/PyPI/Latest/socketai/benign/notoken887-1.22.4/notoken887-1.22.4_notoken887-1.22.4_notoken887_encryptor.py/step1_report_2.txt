  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide simple symmetric encryption and decryption for tokens using character substitution tables.",
  "sources": "The input token string ENCTOKEN and the token parameters passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The transformed token outputs after encryption and decryption, which are printed to the console.",
  "flows": "Input token ENCTOKEN is encrypted via the replace table, output is stored in converted_token, then decrypted back to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs minimal transformation with only a single character substitution ('M' <-> 'x'), which is ineffective for real security. No external data, credentials, or secrets are hardcoded aside from the token string, which appears to be a typical token format. No malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic character substitution cipher with a single character mapping. It operates solely within the Python runtime, with no external data access, network activity, or system modification. The token appears to be a JWT or similar token, but the code does not parse or transmit it beyond printing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the logic is straightforward, serving only basic obfuscation. The hardcoded token string does not introduce security risks within this context, though it might be sensitive if real tokens are used. Overall, the code is benign, functioning as a simple reversible obfuscation mechanism, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs minimal token obfuscation using character substitution and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a simple utility for token transformation with no security risks or malware present.",
