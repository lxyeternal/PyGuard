{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple token encryption/decryption class and demonstrates its usage with a token that appears to be a JWT-like string.",
  "sources": "The input token ENCTOKEN, read during the encrypt and decrypt method calls.",
  "sinks": "The token is transformed and printed; the code does not send data over the network or write to files. No external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The token is read as input, transformed by the replace tables during encryption, then transformed back during decryption.",
  "anomalies": "The token appears to be a JWT-like string containing a payload with sensitive data (possibly a session or authentication token). The code itself only performs character replacements and printing; there are no malicious code injections or obfuscated logic. The token is hardcoded, but this alone isn't malicious. The replacement tables are very simple and do not perform encryption, only substitution.",
  "analysis": "The class provides basic character replacement for a token, with straightforward encryption and decryption functions. The token used resembles a JWT, which could contain sensitive information or be used for authentication. The code's operations are benign: transforming and printing a token. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed. The hardcoded token could pose security concerns if used improperly, but it is not inherently malicious. The minimal transformation does not provide security but may be intended for obfuscation or simple encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple character substitutions on a token that appears to be a JWT or similar token. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is evident. The code's security risk is low, but handling of such tokens should be managed carefully to prevent accidental leakage.",
