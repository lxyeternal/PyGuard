      "conclusion": "The script executes code from an external ZIP archive during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes, making it a supply chain vulnerability. The assigned scores (~0.75 malware, ~0.85 risk) are appropriate given the high potential for malicious code execution during setup."
