  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1**: \n   - Purpose: Blockchain functions, image/IPFS uploads.\n   - Anomalies: Multipart form data with fixed boundary, no secrets.\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Risk score: 0.2\n   - Confidence: 0.9\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - Purpose: Similar blockchain/IPFS functions.\n   - Anomalies: Manual multipart form data with fixed boundary, no secrets.\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Risk score: 0.2\n   - Confidence: 0.8\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - Purpose: Same as above.\n   - Anomalies: Same multipart form data, no secrets.\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Risk score: 0.2\n   - Confidence: 0.9\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - Purpose: Similar blockchain/IPFS functions.\n   - Anomalies: Manual multipart data, no secrets.\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Risk score: 0.2\n   - Confidence: 0.95\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - Purpose: Same general functions.\n   - Anomalies: Multipart form data, no secrets.\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Risk score: 0.2\n   - Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review:\n\n- **Presence of malware**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. Given the code, this seems appropriate. The code interacts with external APIs, handles blockchain transactions, and uploads images, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscation**: All reports mark obfuscated as 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk**: The risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), justified by the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Anomalies**: The only noteworthy anomaly is the manual construction of multipart form data with a fixed boundary string. While unusual, it doesn't inherently imply malicious intent. It could be a point of concern if used maliciously, but in this context, it appears to be a legitimate API interaction.\n\n- **External API interactions**: The code interacts with known services for image and metadata uploads, which is typical for NFT or blockchain projects.\n\n- **Hardcoded secrets**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n\n- **Code logic**: No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The **security risk** score of 0.2 is reasonable given the external API interactions and manual multipart data creation, but overall, the risk is low.\n- The **obfuscated** score should stay at 0, as the code is clear.\n- The **confidence** scores are appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score**: **0**  \n**Obfuscated score**: **0**  \n**Security risk score**: **0.2** (reasonable, but low)  \n\n**Justification**: No malicious activity, no suspicious code, and external API interactions are standard for NFT/Blockchain projects. The manual multipart form data creation is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion**:  \nThe code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The low risk and malware scores are justified. No changes needed.",
