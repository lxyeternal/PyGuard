  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for Solana blockchain interactions, IPFS uploads, and media handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the manual multipart form data creation with a fixed boundary, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. External URLs are legitimate. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The minimal risk score aligns with the straightforward, legitimate functions. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on blockchain and IPFS.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the manual multipart form data with a fixed boundary as mildly suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. External endpoints are standard for NFT workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slightly suspicious multipart creation is noted but not enough to elevate risk. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on blockchain transactions, IPFS uploads, and token management.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above regarding multipart form data with a fixed boundary.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. External API endpoints seem legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified. No malicious indicators; the risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for blockchain and IPFS.\n- **Anomalies:** Manual multipart creation with a fixed boundary, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage. External endpoints are typical for NFT metadata.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard blockchain and media upload functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or backdoors; multipart form data creation is noted but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. External services are legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is justified given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about the manual multipart form data creation with a fixed boundary, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — acceptable for the manual multipart form data; no significant security concern.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis. No changes are necessary.",
