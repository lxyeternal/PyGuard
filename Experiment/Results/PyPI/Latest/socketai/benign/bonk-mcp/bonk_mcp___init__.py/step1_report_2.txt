  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local server module and runs its main function asynchronously. It serves as a simple entry point for starting server logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. It also does not interact with external sources beyond importing its own server module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard entry point script for starting server operations asynchronously. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
