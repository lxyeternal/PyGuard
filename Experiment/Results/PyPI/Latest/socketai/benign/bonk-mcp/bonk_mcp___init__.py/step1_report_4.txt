{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that imports a server module and runs its main function asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the 'server' module and the asyncio.run() call executing server.main()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data output or handling of untrusted input",
  "flows": "The code imports 'server', then asynchronously executes server.main()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a server module and running its main function with asyncio. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden behavior, or unusual code patterns. No external data is read directly, and no untrusted data is processed or transmitted within this snippet. The only potentially risky aspect would depend on what 'server.main()' does, but from this code alone, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign entry point for a server application. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
