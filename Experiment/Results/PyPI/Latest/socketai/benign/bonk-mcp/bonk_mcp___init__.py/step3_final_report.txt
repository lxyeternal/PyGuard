{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for an asynchronous server application, initializing and running the server logic defined in 'server.main()'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a local module 'server' and executes 'server.main()' via asyncio.run().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'server.main()' execution, which could perform network operations or system modifications, but the snippet itself does not contain direct sinks.",
  "flows": "The flow is: import 'server' -> define 'main()' -> execute 'asyncio.run(server.main())' when 'main()' is called.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common async server patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a local module and executing its main function asynchronously. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are visible. The security implications depend entirely on 'server.main()' implementation, which is outside this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident from the snippet itself. The code is a typical async entry point with low inherent risk, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment aligns with the reports. The security posture hinges on the implementation of 'server.main()', which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
