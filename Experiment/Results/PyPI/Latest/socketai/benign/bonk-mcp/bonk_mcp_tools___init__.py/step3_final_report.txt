  "purpose": "This code serves as a module re-export pattern, exposing 'token_launcher_tool' from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'token_launcher_tool' from a local module '.token_launcher'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "Import of 'token_launcher_tool' from local module; re-export via '__all__'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module pattern that imports a symbol from a local module and exposes it via '__all__'. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export with no security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
