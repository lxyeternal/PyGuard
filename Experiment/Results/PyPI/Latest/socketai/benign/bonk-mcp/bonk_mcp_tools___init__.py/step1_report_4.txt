{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports a symbol named 'token_launcher_tool' from a module within the same package, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .token_launcher import token_launcher_tool",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module that re-exports an object from a sibling module. It does not execute any untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network or system operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal nature of the code indicates it serves as a packaging or API exposure mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python modules that organize exports. No malicious intent or security issues are apparent.",
