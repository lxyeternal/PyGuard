  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only re-exporting an imported component; no suspicious activity or secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific function or object 'token_launcher_tool' from a local module and then exposes it in the module's namespace via __all__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data, no security-sensitive operations, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It is a straightforward module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple re-export of a local component with no malicious behavior detected.",
