  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export of a symbol (`token_launcher_tool`) from a local module.\n   - The original code is minimal:\n     ```python\n     from .token_launcher import token_launcher_tool\n     __all__ = [\"token_launcher_tool\"]\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and free of issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple module re-export pattern.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports indicate malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned as 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are based on factual code analysis; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign module re-export with no security concerns.**",
