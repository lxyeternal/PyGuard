  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\nfrom .token_launcher import token_launcher_tool\n\n__all__ = [\"token_launcher_tool\"]\n```\n\nThis code simply imports `token_launcher_tool` from a local module and re-exports it via `__all__`. It is a minimal, straightforward module pattern used for API exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is minimal and standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain any obfuscation or secrets.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — justified, no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Since no malicious activity is present, the malware score remains 0.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a simple re-export pattern with no suspicious behavior or data handling.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign module export pattern with no security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and standard for Python modules.",
