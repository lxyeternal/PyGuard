  "purpose": "Exports the token_launcher_tool from the token_launcher module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .token_launcher",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow beyond module import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single object from a local module and explicitly exports it via __all__, which is a standard practice for module API definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
