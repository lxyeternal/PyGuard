{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Solana blockchain interaction, loading environment variables, defining addresses, and establishing an RPC connection.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'KEYPAIR', environment variable 'RPC_URL', static address strings for system, token, and program IDs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variables are used for configuration only.",
  "flows": "Loading 'KEYPAIR' and 'RPC_URL' from environment variables; defining constants; initializing AsyncClient with RPC URL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; 'KEYPAIR' is loaded but not used here, which is typical for configuration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Solana project, involving environment variable loading, address definitions, and RPC client initialization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The 'KEYPAIR' environment variable is handled securely in context, and all addresses are public keys. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal exposure. The confidence score is high (0.9), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration for a Solana-based application. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
