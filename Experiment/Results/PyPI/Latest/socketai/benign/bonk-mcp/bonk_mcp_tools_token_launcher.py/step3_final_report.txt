  "purpose": "Tool for launching meme tokens on Solana using Raydium launchpad, handling IPFS metadata upload, keypair management, and token creation.",
  "sources": "KEYPAIR environment variable, user input parameters, external functions 'prepare_ipfs' and 'launch_token_with_buy'",
  "sinks": "External functions 'prepare_ipfs' and 'launch_token_with_buy' (potential external data flows), no direct sinks in the code",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> keypair decoding -> IPFS metadata preparation -> token launch -> output response",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for a token launch tool: it decodes a private key from an environment variable, validates user input, prepares IPFS metadata via an external function, and launches a token using another external function. Error handling is basic but appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies are assumed safe; the keypair handling is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's operations and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to reliance on external functions and environment variables, which is typical for such tools. Overall, the code appears safe for use within its intended scope.",
