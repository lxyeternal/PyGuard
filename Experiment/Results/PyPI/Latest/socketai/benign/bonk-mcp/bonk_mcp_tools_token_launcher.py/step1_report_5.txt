{
  "purpose": "The code defines a tool for launching meme tokens on Solana using the Raydium launchpad, including IPFS metadata preparation and token creation.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (token details, URLs), environment variable KEYPAIR, and external functions (prepare_ipfs, launch_token_with_buy).",
  "sinks": "Uses the Keypair for signing transactions, calls external functions for token launch, uploads metadata to IPFS, and returns confirmation messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Keypair decoding -> IPFS metadata preparation -> Token launch via external function -> Response generation.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code appears straightforward and adheres to expected behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads configuration data and user input, decodes a base58-encoded keypair from environment variables, and interacts with external services for IPFS upload and token launching. No evidence of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Error handling is present for keypair decoding and IPFS failures. No obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a token launcher tool for Solana with standard input handling, external service calls, and response formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code segment.",
