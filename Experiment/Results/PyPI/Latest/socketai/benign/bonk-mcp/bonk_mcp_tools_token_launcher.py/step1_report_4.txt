{
  "purpose": "The code provides a tool to launch meme tokens on the Solana blockchain, including preparing IPFS metadata, handling keypairs, and executing token launch operations.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user-provided arguments (token details, URLs), the KEYPAIR environment variable for the private key, and external functions for IPFS preparation and token launch.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data such as the private key (KEYPAIR) and token metadata are processed; potential sensitive outputs include keypair details and token addresses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and environment variables to keypair decoding, IPFS metadata upload, and token launch execution, with results being returned as text content.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly decodes the KEYPAIR environment variable, which may be sensitive; however, this is a common practice for signing transactions. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for token creation on Solana: it decodes a base58 private key, generates a new keypair for the mint, and calls external functions for IPFS upload and token launch. It includes input validation and error handling. No malicious patterns, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors, are evident. The use of environment variables for key management is typical. External function calls are assumed to be legitimate, as they are imported from trusted modules. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate tool for token deployment on Solana, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It handles sensitive data properly and performs expected blockchain operations.",
