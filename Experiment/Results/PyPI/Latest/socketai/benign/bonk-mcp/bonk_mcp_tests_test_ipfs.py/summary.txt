  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward testing utility for IPFS metadata preparation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
