{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to test the IPFS functionality of a token launcher tool by uploading image and metadata information to IPFS.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from command line arguments and user-provided URLs; imports the 'prepare_ipfs' utility function from 'bonk_mcp.utils'.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'prepare_ipfs' function which likely interacts with IPFS; prints output data to console; no direct sinks of untrusted data to network or files are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs (URLs and metadata) are passed to 'prepare_ipfs' which processes and returns a metadata URI; the flow involves reading input, processing via utility function, and outputting results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; the script appears straightforward and primarily for testing IPFS upload functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function to prepare IPFS metadata, accepts user input via command line or defaults, and tests IPFS upload by invoking 'prepare_ipfs'. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are evident. The functions print results to console, which is typical for test scripts. No external network communication beyond what 'prepare_ipfs' might perform internally is observed; the script itself does not perform malicious actions. It appears to be a legitimate testing utility for IPFS uploads without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard IPFS testing tool with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads inputs, calls a utility function, and outputs results. There are no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
