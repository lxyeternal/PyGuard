{
  "purpose": "A benign test script for preparing IPFS metadata and uploading images via an external utility.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (CLI args or defaults) passed to the script; the 'prepare_ipfs' utility function imported from an external module.",
  "sinks": "The 'prepare_ipfs' function, which likely performs network operations; no direct sinks in this script.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from user or defaults into 'prepare_ipfs', which then processes and returns a URI; the script outputs the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, synchronous test harness that collects metadata parameters, calls an external 'prepare_ipfs' utility asynchronously, and prints results. It does not handle secrets, perform network operations directly, or contain malicious logic. The external utility's behavior is unknown but presumed safe given context. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. The script's security posture relies on the external utility, but the script itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward testing utility for IPFS metadata preparation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
