{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to test IPFS metadata preparation functionality for a token launcher, including image upload and metadata creation.",
  "sources": "User input for image_url, name, symbol, description, twitter, telegram, website; imported function 'prepare_ipfs' from 'bonk_mcp.utils'.",
  "sinks": "The 'prepare_ipfs' function is called with user-provided parameters; any untrusted input may influence its behavior, but the code itself does not directly process or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "User inputs (via command-line or function parameters) flow into 'prepare_ipfs' function, which presumably handles the IPFS upload and metadata creation; no explicit external data flows observed in this script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses default URLs and parameters for testing purposes, which appear benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward testing utility for IPFS functionality. It imports a specific utility function and runs an asynchronous test that calls 'prepare_ipfs' with provided metadata details. The parameters are mostly default or user-supplied via CLI arguments. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The use of async/await appears standard. All user data is passed directly to the utility without further processing. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or insecure code patterns are present. The code structure is clear and typical for such a test script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing script for IPFS metadata creation, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply facilitates a test of a utility function with user-provided parameters.",
