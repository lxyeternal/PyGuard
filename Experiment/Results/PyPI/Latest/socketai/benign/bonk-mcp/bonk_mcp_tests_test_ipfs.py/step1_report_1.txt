{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to test the IPFS functionality within a token launcher tool, specifically preparing and uploading token metadata and images to IPFS.",
  "sources": "Reads input data such as image_url, name, symbol, description, twitter, telegram, website from command line arguments and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls the prepare_ipfs function which likely interacts with external IPFS services, and prints results; no direct sensitive sinks are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into prepare_ipfs, which then generates metadata URI; the flow is straightforward from user input to external service interaction via the utility function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The script primarily handles metadata preparation and IPFS interactions. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function 'prepare_ipfs' from bonk_mcp.utils, then calls it with user-provided metadata details. All data appears to be standard metadata without any embedded malicious code or suspicious payloads. There are no network connections in this script itself; interactions with external IPFS services are abstracted within 'prepare_ipfs'. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are present. The script functions as a simple test harness with user inputs and external IPFS calls. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are evident. Overall, the script seems benign and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for IPFS metadata preparation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It interacts with external IPFS services via a utility function, and all data flows are standard for such testing tools.",
