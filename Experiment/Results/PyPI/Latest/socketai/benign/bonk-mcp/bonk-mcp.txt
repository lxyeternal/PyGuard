      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment aligns with the reports. The security posture hinges on the implementation of 'server.main()', which is outside the scope of this snippet."

      "conclusion": "The server code appears benign and straightforward, with the main security risk stemming from invoking an external tool ('token_launcher_tool') with unvalidated inputs. No embedded malware or obfuscation is detected. The risk level is moderate due to reliance on external components, and input validation should be implemented to mitigate potential exploitation."
