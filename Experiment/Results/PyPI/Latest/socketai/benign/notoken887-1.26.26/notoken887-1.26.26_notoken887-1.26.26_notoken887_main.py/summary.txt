  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns that pose significant security risks, including potential malicious payload execution. The use of exec() on decrypted code and the generation of scripts that run code without validation are red flags. The missing decryption function suggests incomplete or intentionally obscured code. Overall, the pattern warrants cautious handling, with a recommended security risk score around 0.75 and a malware score near 0.5."
