  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility or library module, likely intended for data processing or system interaction, but the specific purpose is unclear due to missing or minimal context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, subprocess executions, or data transmissions, which could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions to sinks such as network or file operations, passing through processing functions or validation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or malicious code constructs are present. Unusual patterns such as dynamic code execution or obfuscated code are absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, lacking identifiable malicious constructs or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain obfuscation or known malware patterns. The lack of detailed context limits confidence, but based on the visible content, it appears benign. The structure is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the current analysis. It appears to be a standard utility or component with no evident security threats.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
