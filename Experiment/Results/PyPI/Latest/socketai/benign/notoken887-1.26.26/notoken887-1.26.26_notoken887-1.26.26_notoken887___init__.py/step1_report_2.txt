  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or network communication, but specific purpose cannot be determined without detailed analysis.",
  "sources": "Data sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet; potentially reading from files, network, or environment variables depending on further context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, or system commands, but no explicit sink points are clearly visible in the current fragment.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow can be established from the provided code segment alone; further context needed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified in the visible code. Lack of comments or unusual language features, but detailed analysis is limited by snippet size.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard Python syntax with imports, function definitions, and procedural logic. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no insecure practices are apparent based on the visible segment. However, without seeing the complete code, it’s difficult to rule out hidden malicious intent. No obfuscation or obfuscated code is detected. The structure and content appear normal and consistent with legitimate code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The code appears standard, with no suspicious patterns or security risks evident in this fragment. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of complete context. No malware or malicious activities are detected.",
