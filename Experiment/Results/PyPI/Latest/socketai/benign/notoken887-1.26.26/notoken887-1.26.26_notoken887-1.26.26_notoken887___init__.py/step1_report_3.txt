  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network connections, or data writes, but none are evident without actual code content.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are observable in the absence of actual code.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to the lack of provided code. No malicious or unusual patterns can be identified without examining actual code lines. The initial instruction suggests a thorough review, but the code content is missing.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The review cannot be conclusively performed without the specific code. No obfuscation or malware indicators are detectable.",
