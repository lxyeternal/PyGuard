  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a general Python script potentially designed for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, possibly from environment variables or external data sources, depending on context (not specified).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system calls if present; specific sink points are not clearly identified due to lack of code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching output points or external systems, but detailed flow paths are not visible from the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are apparent; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review reveals no signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. Without further details, no anomalies are identified. The code's purpose appears benign, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no indication of malware or malicious behavior. The code seems to perform standard functions without security risks. However, due to lack of detailed context, confidence is moderate.",
