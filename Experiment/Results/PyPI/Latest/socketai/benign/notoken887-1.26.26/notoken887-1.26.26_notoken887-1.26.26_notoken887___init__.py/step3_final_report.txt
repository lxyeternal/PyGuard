  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reads, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via code execution paths, data handling, or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports correctly identify the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging general supply chain vigilance. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on code completeness and context; high confidence (0.9) in detailed assessments, low (0.2) where code is missing. No significant anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected across reports. Given the limited code snippets and their benign nature, the scores are justified and aligned with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and accurately assess the code as benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment remains that the dependency is safe based on current evidence.",
