{
  "purpose": "A static character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings with emojis and symbols, intended for playful obfuscation or simple encoding.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() or decrypt() methods, character literals within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or system interactions; all operations are internal string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input string -> character replacements -> output string (encrypted or decrypted).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code; extensive static replacements but no dynamic or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward, reversible substitution cipher mapping characters to emojis and vice versa. It contains no external dependencies, network calls, or system modifications. The replacements are static and transparent, indicating no malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The design is simple, with no obfuscation beyond extensive static character mappings. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher used for playful encoding. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
