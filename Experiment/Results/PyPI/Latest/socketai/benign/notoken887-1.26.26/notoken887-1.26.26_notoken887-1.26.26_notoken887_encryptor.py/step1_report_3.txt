{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based substitution encryption and decryption for strings, replacing each character with a corresponding emoji or symbol.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected to be passed to the 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' methods as string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The methods return the transformed string; no external data or output occurs within these methods, but the data can be transmitted or stored elsewhere after processing.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt/decrypt method → character replacements → output string",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward, reversible character substitutions without any apparent malicious logic or external calls. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network interactions are present. The use of emojis and symbols appears solely for obfuscation or encoding purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'. Each method performs a series of chained string replacements to map characters to emojis or symbols and vice versa. The replacements are static and extensive, covering alphanumeric characters, some punctuation, and special characters. There are no external inputs, no network operations, no file I/O, or code execution. The structure is simple, and the logic is consistent for reversible transformation. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation intended to hide malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher implementation, likely intended for obfuscation or encoding purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of external interactions and the straightforward logic suggest no supply chain or security threats.",
