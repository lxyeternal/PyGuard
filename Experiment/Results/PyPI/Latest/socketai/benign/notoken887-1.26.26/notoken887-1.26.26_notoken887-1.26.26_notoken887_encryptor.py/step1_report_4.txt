{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher functionality for encoding and decoding strings using emojis as replacement characters.",
  "sources": "Input data is read through method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token' in encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned directly from the methods; no external sinks or output actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into the encrypt/decrypt methods and are transformed via character replacements, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacements; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious imports or external dependencies are included.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher using emoji characters. Both methods perform complete character replacements for encryption and decryption. No input validation, cryptographic security measures, or external communications are involved. The code does not include any backdoors, network activity, or malicious system access. The structure and operations are clear and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. Overall, it functions as a simple obfuscation tool rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a substitution cipher that replaces characters with emojis for obfuscation purposes. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present. It appears solely to encode/decode strings and does not pose any threat.",
