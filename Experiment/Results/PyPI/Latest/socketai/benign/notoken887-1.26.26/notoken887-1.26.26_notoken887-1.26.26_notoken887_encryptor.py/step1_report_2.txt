{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution cipher encryption and decryption for strings, replacing characters with emoji symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input strings passed to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string replacements but does not involve any system calls, network operations, or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed via character substitutions in both encrypt and decrypt methods. There are no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a straightforward character replacement cipher; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher, replacing characters with emojis during encryption and reversing the process during decryption. The replacements are static and predefined, with no dynamic execution, external calls, or hidden behaviors. There is no indication of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network access, or code injection. The simplicity and static nature of the code imply low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious character substitution cipher with no security risks or malware indicators. It appears to be intended for obfuscating text for aesthetic or trivial purposes rather than security.",
