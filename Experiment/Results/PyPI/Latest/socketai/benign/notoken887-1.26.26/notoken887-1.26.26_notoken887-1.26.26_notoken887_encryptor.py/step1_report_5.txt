{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by substituting characters with emoji symbols and vice versa, serving as a simple reversible obfuscation or encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "Input data: strings passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Output data: the encrypted or decrypted strings returned by methods. No external data or untrusted sources are read or written.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character through replacement mappings in encrypt() and decrypt(), with direct source-to-sink transformation via replace() calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive character replacement for obfuscation without any cryptographic security or validation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are present. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are observed. The replacement mappings are static and consistent, serving purely as an encoding scheme.",
  "analysis": "The class defines two methods: encrypt() and decrypt(). Each uses a chain of string.replace() calls to substitute characters with emojis and vice versa. These operations are straightforward, static, and do not involve external input beyond the method parameters. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears purely superficial for encoding purposes. No suspicious logic, code injection points, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code structure is simple, and the functions do not perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character mapping encoder/decoder with no malicious behavior or security threats. It appears to serve as a simple obfuscation tool rather than malware or a security risk.",
