  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'notoken887' Python package, including metadata, package discovery, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication; standard setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is suspicious ('hitler@gmail.com'), which is unusual and potentially inappropriate; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and a console script entry point. There are no suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The only notable anomaly is the unprofessional and potentially offensive email address. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data, no network communications, and no hardcoded secrets. The setup appears benign, focused solely on package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks aside from the unprofessional email address. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
