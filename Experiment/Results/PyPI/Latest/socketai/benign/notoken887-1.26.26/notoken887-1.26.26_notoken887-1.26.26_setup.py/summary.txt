  "conclusion": "The package's setup script is benign in functionality, with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern lies in the suspicious metadata, which could be exploited if the package is distributed. Overall, the code itself poses minimal technical risk, but metadata warrants caution. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero; the security risk score should be around 0.3 to reflect metadata concerns."
