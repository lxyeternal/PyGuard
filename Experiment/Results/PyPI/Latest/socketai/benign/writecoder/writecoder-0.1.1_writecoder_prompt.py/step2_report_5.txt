  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static template strings used for generating project scaffolding, dependencies, and shell commands.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The \"malware\" scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0 or very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippets are static string templates (`PyEngineer` and `AiSheller`) with placeholders for user input.\n- No code performs any execution, evaluation, or data handling beyond string formatting.\n- The code's purpose is to serve as scaffolding/templates, not to run or process untrusted data at runtime.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and template-based.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and free from malicious behavior is sound.\n\n### Scores:\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the static nature of the code.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified because there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted input, nor does it contain hidden payloads.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- The reports' conclusions align with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, static templates.  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — minimal, justifiable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is a collection of static templates for project scaffolding and environment setup, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this understanding appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis is a safe, benign code snippet serving as project scaffolding templates.",
