  "purpose": "Generate Python SDK code, project structure, and environment dependencies based on user tasks; generate shell commands for project management and environment setup.",
  "sources": "User-provided template strings for Python code and shell commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input templates to code and shell command generation; no data flow involving untrusted sources or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists of template strings without actual executable code; no embedded or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The shell commands reflect typical project management and package handling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippets are template strings intended for generating Python code and shell commands based on user input. The Python string 'PyEngineer' is a multi-line string describing the task and project structure generation instructions, not executable code. Similarly, 'AiSheller' is a multi-line string with instructions for shell commands for project environment management and package handling. Neither string contains executable code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are present. The structure indicates a code/template generator rather than active malicious code. The overall content appears to be benign, focusing on project scaffolding and environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template setup for generating project files, dependencies, and shell commands based on user input. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
