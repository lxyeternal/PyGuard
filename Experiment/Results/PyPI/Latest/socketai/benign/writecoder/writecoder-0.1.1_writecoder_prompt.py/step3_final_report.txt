  "purpose": "Static string templates for generating Python SDK code and project environment management commands, intended as scaffolding.",
  "sources": "String placeholders ({task}, {docs}) and static command templates within the strings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data input or output, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; templates are static and do not process untrusted input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static strings with placeholders, no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string templates for project scaffolding and shell commands, with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to serve as templates, not to perform any active operations. The lack of dynamic evaluation or external data handling indicates a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static templates for project setup and environment commands, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores and reasoning in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
