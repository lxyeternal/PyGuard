{
  "purpose": "The code generates templates for Python SDK development and shell commands for project environment management, including dependency specification, project structure, and common tasks.",
  "sources": "String literals containing instructions and templates; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system security; no data leaks or code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations; code mainly provides static templates and command instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two string templates: 'PyEngineer' for generating Python SDK project scaffolding and 'AiSheller' for creating shell commands for project environment management. Both contain instructions, placeholders for user input, and command sequences. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data handling, or executable code beyond static template text. The code does not perform any network communication, data processing, or system modifications. Overall, it appears to be benign template generation code without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely template and instruction text intended for code and environment scaffolding. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It serves as a static aid for project setup and management.",
