{
  "purpose": "Generate Python SDK templates and project environment management scripts based on user-defined tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via string formatting placeholders '{task}' and '{docs}', and defines static strings for SDK and shell command templates.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process untrusted data beyond string formatting placeholders; no direct sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "User inputs '{task}' and '{docs}' influence the generated SDK code and shell commands, but there are no dynamic flows executing or evaluating untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders '{task}', '{docs}' in template strings is typical; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines template strings for generating SDK code and shell scripts based on user input. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications. The structure is straightforward and intended for template generation, which is not inherently malicious. There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign template generator designed for project scaffolding and task automation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code functions as a template generator for Python SDK and project environment scripts. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for legitimate development purposes.",
