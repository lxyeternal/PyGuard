  "purpose": "Generate Python SDK templates and project management shell commands based on user input",
  "sources": "User-provided string templates for Python code and shell commands",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code templates define structure and commands",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static templates and shell commands",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two string templates: 'PyEngineer' for generating Python SDK code and project structure, and 'AiSheller' for generating shell commands for project environment management. Both templates are static, parameterized only by placeholders for user input. No code injection, external data handling, or malicious logic is present. The content appears to be straightforward instructions and code templates for legitimate development and project management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for project setup and management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
