  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same import statement: `from . import test_sale_stock_service_level`.\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of a relative import.\n- No data flows, network activity, or processing are present.\n- The module name suggests testing or service level context but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, with confidence scores of 1 (except report 4 with 0.6).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The import statement is present in all reports and matches the original code.\n- No evidence of code execution, data handling, or malicious behavior is found.\n- The code is standard Python syntax for modular imports.\n\n### Flaws or logical issues:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is that report 4 assigns a security risk of 0.2, possibly due to the module's testing context, but this is speculative without further code.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the context. The slight risk assigned in report 4 (0.2) is cautious but not unreasonable, considering the module name suggests testing.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is benign and simple, the scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed for the scores.\n- The cautious note in report 4 about potential testing modules is acceptable but does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or at most 0.2 if considering testing modules, but 0 is fine)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as harmless.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- The module name suggests testing but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk score at 0.0.",
