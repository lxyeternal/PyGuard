  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'test_sale_stock_service_level' from the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement at the beginning of the module, which loads a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no input or data manipulation occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with relative import syntax; no anomalies, secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal code snippet consisting solely of a relative import statement. It does not process data, handle untrusted input, or perform any operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this line alone. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malware, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for Python projects that structure code into modules.",
