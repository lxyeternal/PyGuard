  "purpose": "To import the 'models' module from the current package, likely for use within a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external data or input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the import is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement in Python, which is common in modular codebases. It does not perform any dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1 or 0). The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present. The code poses no security threat and is standard practice in Python package organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The import statement is standard and safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
