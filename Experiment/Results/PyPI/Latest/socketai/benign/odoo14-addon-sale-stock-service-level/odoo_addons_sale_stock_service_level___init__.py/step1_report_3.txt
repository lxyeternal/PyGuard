{
  "purpose": "Import local models module, likely for application logic or data handling",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from the current package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow since only an import statement is present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only a relative import without any suspicious or complex behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing a module named 'models' from the same package. This is typical for modular Python projects and does not by itself indicate malicious intent. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious constructs. The import statement alone is benign and standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import of a models module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a standard application structure.",
