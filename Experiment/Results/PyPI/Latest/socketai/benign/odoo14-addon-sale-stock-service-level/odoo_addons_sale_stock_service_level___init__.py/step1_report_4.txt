{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'models' module from the current package, likely for use within the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself reads the 'models' module within the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple relative import statement, which is a standard Python feature for modular code organization. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or risky patterns. Since the code is only one line and performs an import, there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risks here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a typical purpose in modular Python projects. No malicious or security concerns are evident based solely on this import statement.",
