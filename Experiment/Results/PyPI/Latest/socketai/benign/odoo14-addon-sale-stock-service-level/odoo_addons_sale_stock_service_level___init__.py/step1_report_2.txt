{
  "purpose": "Import modules from the current package, likely to use models defined locally",
  "sources": "The import statement reading from the current package's __init__.py or models module",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "No data flow; just an import statement without further code execution",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no suspicious or unusual code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports a module named 'models' from the current package. There are no functions, variables, data handling, or code execution present. As it stands, this code does not perform any operations, data processing, or network communication. Given its simplicity, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a minimal and standard pattern used in Python packages to include local modules.",
