{
  "purpose": "Extends the sale.order.line model in Odoo to include a related 'service_level_id' field and ensures this field is included in procurement values.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'service_level_id' from the 'sale.order.line' instance and the 'order_id' relationship.",
  "sinks": "The '_prepare_procurement_values' method outputs a dictionary that includes 'service_level_id', which is used downstream in procurement processes.",
  "flows": "The 'service_level_id' is read from the current record, then included into procurement values via '_prepare_procurement_values' method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present. The code uses standard Odoo ORM practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension that adds a related field and overrides a method to include this field in procurement values. The implementation appears straightforward and follows typical conventions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. There are no external inputs, malicious data flows, or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of an Odoo model, adding a related field and propagating it to procurement values. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
