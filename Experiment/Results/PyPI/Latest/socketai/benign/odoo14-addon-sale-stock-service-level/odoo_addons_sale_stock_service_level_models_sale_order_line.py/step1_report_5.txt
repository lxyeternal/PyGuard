{
  "purpose": "Extending the sale.order.line model to include a service level field and propagating it during procurement preparation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'service_level_id' field from the current sale.order.line instance and the 'order_id.service_level_id' via related field.",
  "sinks": "The 'service_level_id' is included in the procurement values returned, potentially influencing procurement behavior.",
  "flows": "The 'service_level_id' is accessed from the current object, then passed into the procurement values dictionary, which is used downstream in procurement logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply extends a model and propagates a field.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the Odoo sale.order.line model to include a new field 'service_level_id' which relates to 'stock.service.level'. It then overrides '_prepare_procurement_values' to include this field's value into the procurement data. All operations are standard model extension procedures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The flow is straightforward, propagating a user-configurable field, and the code complies with typical Odoo development patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, extending existing models in a standard way without any malicious intent. It simply adds and propagates a field relevant to procurement logic. No security risks or malware are detected.",
