{
  "purpose": "Extend the sale.order.line model to include a related field for service level and ensure this information is included when preparing procurement values.",
  "sources": "The class definition, field declaration, and method _prepare_procurement_values.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary in _prepare_procurement_values, which could influence procurement behavior.",
  "flows": "The method _prepare_procurement_values reads self.service_level_id and includes its ID in the returned dictionary, which is used downstream in procurement processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The use of super() and related fields is standard in Odoo modules. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Odoo model extension. It adds a related field 'service_level_id' that links to the sale order's service level. The method _prepare_procurement_values is overridden to include this field's ID in the procurement values dictionary, facilitating procurement logic to consider service level. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual data flows. The code appears clean, intended for business logic enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model to include service level information in procurement processing. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
