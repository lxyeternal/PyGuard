  "purpose": "Extend the 'sale.order.line' model by adding a related field 'service_level_id' pointing to 'stock.service.level' and include it in procurement values.",
  "sources": "Reads 'order_id.service_level_id' to propagate 'service_level_id' into procurement data.",
  "sinks": "The 'service_level_id' is passed into procurement values; no external untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "From 'self.service_level_id.id' in '_prepare_procurement_values' to the procurement data dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Odoo model extension, adding a related field and propagating it into procurement values. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or handle untrusted inputs. The logic is simple and aligns with standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, though the security risk score in report 5 slightly overestimates the risk; it can be lowered to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard extension with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, with minor overestimation of security risk in one case. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
