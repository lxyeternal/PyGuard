{
  "purpose": "Extend the 'sale.order.line' model in Odoo to include a related field for 'service_level_id' and to pass this value during procurement preparation.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'self.service_level_id.id' within the '_prepare_procurement_values' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'service_level_id' is passed into the procurement values dictionary, potentially affecting procurement behavior.",
  "flows": "Input source is 'self.service_level_id', which is a related field, flowing into the procurement values to influence procurement processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is standard for Odoo model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a related field to capture service level information. The '_prepare_procurement_values' method enhances procurement data with this field. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The code only manipulates model data within standard Odoo practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical model extension in Odoo, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It safely adds a related field and passes data during procurement preparation without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
