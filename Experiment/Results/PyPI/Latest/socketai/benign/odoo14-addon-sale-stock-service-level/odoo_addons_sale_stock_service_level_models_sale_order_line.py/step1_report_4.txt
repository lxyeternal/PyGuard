{
  "purpose": "Extend the sale.order.line model to include a related field for service level and modify procurement values accordingly.",
  "sources": "The 'service_level_id' field retrieves data from the related 'order_id' object; the '_prepare_procurement_values' method reads 'self.service_level_id.id'.",
  "sinks": "The '_prepare_procurement_values' method outputs a dictionary that includes 'service_level_id', which may influence procurement processes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'self.service_level_id' (source) into the dictionary returned by '_prepare_procurement_values' (sink), affecting procurement values based on related order data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward Odoo model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly extends the 'sale.order.line' model by adding a related field 'service_level_id', linking to 'stock.service.level'. The method '_prepare_procurement_values' augments the procurement data with this field. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues; the code simply propagates existing data for procurement logic. No external inputs, untrusted data handling, or insecure patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension of an Odoo model for adding a related field and modifying procurement values accordingly. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, it appears safe and aligned with typical Odoo development practices.",
