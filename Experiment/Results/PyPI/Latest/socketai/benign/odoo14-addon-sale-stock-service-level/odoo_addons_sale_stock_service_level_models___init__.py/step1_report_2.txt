  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are identifiable in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of import statements with no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This snippet consists only of relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages to include internal modules. No data input, output, or execution logic is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Due to its simplicity, it provides no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a larger package that imports internal modules. No malicious activity, security issues, or anomalies are detected in this fragment.",
