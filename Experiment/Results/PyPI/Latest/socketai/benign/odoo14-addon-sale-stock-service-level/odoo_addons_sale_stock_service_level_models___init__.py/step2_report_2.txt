  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements, which are straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5. Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a securityRisk of 0 seems more appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly states the code is benign. The securityRisk score should be lowered to 0, as there's no potential for harm.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, only import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight non-zero score might be overly cautious; the code is clearly benign.\n- **Justification:** The report's assessment is reasonable, but the securityRisk could be lowered to 0 for clarity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The report is accurate; the code is standard import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and only consists of import statements.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The securityRisk scores are slightly inconsistent; a score of 0.5 or 0.1 for such trivial code is unwarranted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 for all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0, given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious patterns.\n\n### Overall:\n- The code is a standard module import pattern with no security concerns.\n- The scores should be adjusted to reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices for evaluating such code snippets.",
