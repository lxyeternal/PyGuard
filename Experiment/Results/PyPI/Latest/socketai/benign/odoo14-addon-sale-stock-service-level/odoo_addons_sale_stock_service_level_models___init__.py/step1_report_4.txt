  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: sale_order_line and sale_order.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for modules named sale_order_line and sale_order. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. As such, it appears to be a standard import block typical in Python packages and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of module import statements with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
