{
  "purpose": "The code imports local modules 'sale_order_line' and 'sale_order' as part of a Python package, serving to include these modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statements read the local modules 'sale_order_line' and 'sale_order' from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules from the local package; no data flows or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for two modules, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. This pattern is typical in Python packages for modular organization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The import statements do not involve any dynamic execution, external data, or secrets. The simplicity and clarity of the code strongly suggest benign intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign and standard nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, aligning with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
