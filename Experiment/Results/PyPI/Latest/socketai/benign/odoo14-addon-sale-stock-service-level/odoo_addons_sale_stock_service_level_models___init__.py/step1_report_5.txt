  "purpose": "Import modules related to sale order and sale order line, likely for business logic processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules: . import sale_order_line and . import sale_order.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within these import statements; they only load internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements that reference local modules in the package. There is no processing, data input, or external communication. Since it is only importing two modules, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors. The simplicity and lack of additional logic suggest this is standard module import code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be normal application code with no anomalies.",
