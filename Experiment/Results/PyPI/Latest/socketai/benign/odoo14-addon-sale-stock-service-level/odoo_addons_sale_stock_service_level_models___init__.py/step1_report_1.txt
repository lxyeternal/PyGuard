  "purpose": "Import modules related to sale order and sale order line, likely for use within a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package directory: sale_order_line and sale_order.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified within this snippet; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code consists solely of straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements from the same package directory, importing 'sale_order_line' and 'sale_order'. There are no functions, data processing, or external network interactions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. As such, it appears to be a standard module import pattern typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. This code is safe and likely part of a larger, legitimate application.",
