  "purpose": "Extend the 'sale.order' model in Odoo by adding a 'service_level_id' Many2one field referencing 'stock.service.level'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a class and a field declaration within the model.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only declares a model extension with a field.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The 'index' parameter is set to the string 'btree_not_null', whereas it should be a boolean (True/False). This appears to be a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a new Many2one field. It contains no external data handling, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The only anomaly is the 'index' parameter set as a string, which is unconventional and likely a typo. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the misconfiguration, which does not pose a security threat but should be corrected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. The only issue is the incorrect 'index' parameter value, which should be a boolean. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ≈ 0.1. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present.",
