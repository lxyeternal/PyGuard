{
  "purpose": "Extend the Odoo sale.order model to include a 'service_level_id' field for specifying the service level.",
  "sources": "Import of 'fields' and 'models' from Odoo; definition of a new model extension; usage of 'fields.Many2one' to define a relationship.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the database (reading model 'sale.order') to the added 'service_level_id' field; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing Odoo model by adding a new field 'service_level_id' with standard field definition practices. The use of 'index', 'comodel_name', and 'help' attributes are typical for improving database performance and usability. No external data handling, network communication, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward model extension for functional purposes within the Odoo framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious extension of an Odoo model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or harmful actions, external communications, or malicious code segments.",
