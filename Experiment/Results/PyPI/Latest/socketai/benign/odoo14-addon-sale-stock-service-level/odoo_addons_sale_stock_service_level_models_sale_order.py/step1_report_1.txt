  "purpose": "Extend the sale.order model in Odoo by adding a new field for service level selection.",
  "sources": "Import statements from odoo library, class definition, and field declaration",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data inputs or outputs present",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines a data model extension without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed. The code appears to be a standard Odoo model extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Odoo modules, extends the sale.order model by adding a 'service_level_id' field, which is a Many2one relation to 'stock.service.level'. The field includes typical attributes like string, index, comodel_name, and help. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leaks. The code follows standard Odoo development practices and does not perform any external calls, data processing, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model to add a new relational field. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
