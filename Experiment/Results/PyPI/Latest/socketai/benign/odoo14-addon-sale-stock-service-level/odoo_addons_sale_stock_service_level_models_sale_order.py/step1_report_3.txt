{
  "purpose": "Extend the sale.order model by adding a new field 'service_level_id' for selecting a service level.",
  "sources": "Import of 'fields' and 'models' from 'odoo'; reading class and field definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a data model extension.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'index' parameter with value 'btree_not_null' is unusual; normally index is a boolean. This might be a misconfiguration or typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding a Many2one relation with a help tooltip. No user input handling or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded secrets, no external data sources, no malicious code patterns. The 'index' parameter usage is atypical but likely a configuration mistake rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple model extension for Odoo, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only notable aspect is the potentially incorrect 'index' parameter, but this is not malicious.",
