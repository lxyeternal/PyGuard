  "purpose": "Manifest configuration for an Odoo module named 'Sale stock service level' that adds service level management to sales and stock.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author, dependencies, data files, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the manifest references external files and dependencies but contains no executable code.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the manifest to the Odoo framework during module installation; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the manifest appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a standard Odoo module manifest with no executable logic or embedded code. The reports associated are empty, indicating either incomplete analysis or lack of detailed findings. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from the manifest alone. Given the absence of code, logs, or detailed responses, there is no basis to identify vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores should reflect the lack of evidence: malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) due to incomplete data but no apparent issues.",
  "conclusion": "The manifest is benign and standard; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The reports lack substantive data, so no concerns can be confirmed. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package appears safe based on available information.",
