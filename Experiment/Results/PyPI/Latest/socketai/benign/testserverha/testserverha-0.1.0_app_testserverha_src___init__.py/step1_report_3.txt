  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without further context or comments, its specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or APIs, though no explicit input sources are shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to logs, files, or sent over the network, and possibly interacts with the system or external services; specific sink points are not clearly defined without more context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or function parameters) through internal processing functions, potentially reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls are detected in the snippet provided. However, the absence of comments or explicit context limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard Python constructs with imports and functions, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. There is no evidence of code injection, unsafe SQL, or unauthorized network activity. The code appears structured and straightforward, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious behavior. Given the limited snippet, no indicators of malware or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The code appears benign and follows normal coding practices. However, due to lack of full context, a low-confidence assessment is maintained.",
