{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or module with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules",
  "sinks": "Potentially logs or outputs data, but no malicious data flows identified",
  "flows": "Environment variables or input data to output or logs, with no suspicious transformations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or absent in some reports, with no logic or data flow. When present, it reads environment variables and parameters without suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious indicators are detected. Confidence is moderate to high depending on the completeness of the code snippets. The overall security risk is low, with no evidence of malicious activity or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippets and analyses, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score is conservatively set at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern given the limited or benign code. The assessments across reports are consistent and reasonable.",
