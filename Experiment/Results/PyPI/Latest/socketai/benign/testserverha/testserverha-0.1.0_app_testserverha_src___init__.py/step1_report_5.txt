{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose evident from the visible code snippet.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading input from environment variables, files, or user input (if any are present), though none are explicitly shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve writing data to files, sending data over the network, or executing system commands, but no such actions are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input and output points shown, no clear source-to-sink data flows are observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure appears normal, with standard function definitions and control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward and does not contain any obvious malicious patterns. There are no signs of data leaks, insecure operations, or hidden behaviors. Lack of external data sources or sinks in the snippet limits detection of malicious flows. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. However, due to limited context, some assumptions about its benign nature are made.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not contain malware indicators. Confidence in this assessment is high, but limited context prevents a comprehensive review.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
