  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic Python script performing standard operations such as importing modules, defining functions, and executing main logic. No clear purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external input or user data.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration points are found.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows identified; the code executes locally without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Python operations without any malicious behavior. It lacks network activity, data collection, or system modification. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The overall structure indicates a benign script with standard functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
