  "purpose": "The code defines a tool function using the FastMCP framework to generate a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the function parameter 'name' and the string argument in the FastMCP constructor.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a string containing the input name; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows from the function parameter to the returned string; no external data flows or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. Usage of third-party library is typical for such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a known package, initializes an object with a server name, and defines a simple tool function that returns a formatted greeting. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks identified. The code's purpose appears to be straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign implementation of a tool using the FastMCP framework with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
