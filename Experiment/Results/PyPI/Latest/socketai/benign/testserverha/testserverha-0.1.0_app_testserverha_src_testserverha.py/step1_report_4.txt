{
  "purpose": "The code defines a tool function within an MCP (possibly a modular component platform) framework, intended to return a greeting message when invoked.",
  "sources": "Importing 'FastMCP' from 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and initializing 'mcp' with a server name; usage of the 'test_tool' function which takes 'name' as input.",
  "sinks": "The 'test_tool' function uses string formatting with user-provided 'name', which could be a source of injection if the output is used unsafely elsewhere, but within this code it only returns a formatted string.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into 'test_tool' and is inserted into the return string; the return value could be used elsewhere, but no external data flow or network activity is directly present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears straightforward with a simple function registration and string return.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, initializes an object, and defines a function decorated as a tool for the MCP framework. The function takes a string input and returns a greeting message. There are no indications of malicious activity, no data leakage, network activity, or obfuscated code. The usage of string formatting is safe here, assuming the function's output is used securely. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond the standard function operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward implementation of a tool registration within an MCP framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security issues detected.",
