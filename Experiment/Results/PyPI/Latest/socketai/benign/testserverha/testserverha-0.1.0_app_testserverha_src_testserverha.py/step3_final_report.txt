{
  "purpose": "A simple tool registration within the FastMCP framework that returns a greeting message incorporating a provided name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' in the 'test_tool' function",
  "sinks": "String return containing 'name'; no external data sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows directly into the formatted string returned by 'test_tool'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known class, initializes an object with a static string, and defines a simple function that returns a greeting message. There are no external data sources, sinks, or network activity. The use of a static string 'test-server' is benign. The string formatting with 'name' is safe within this context. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the provided reports are appropriate; minor adjustments recommend setting the malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and the risk score to 0 for consistency, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
