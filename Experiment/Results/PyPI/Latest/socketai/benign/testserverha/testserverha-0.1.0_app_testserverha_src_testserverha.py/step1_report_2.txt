{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize an object from the FastMCP class and defines a simple tool function that returns a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.server.fastmcp; instantiation of FastMCP object with a server address; decorator application for test_tool function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks, network connections, or data output points beyond the greeting message.",
  "flows": "The function takes a string input 'name' and returns a formatted greeting string; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated elements or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, creates an instance with a fixed server address 'test-server', and defines a tool function that returns a formatted greeting. There are no hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behaviors present. The code structure is simple, with clear purpose and no complex logic or external data handling beyond local function scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for defining a simple tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations or data leaks.",
