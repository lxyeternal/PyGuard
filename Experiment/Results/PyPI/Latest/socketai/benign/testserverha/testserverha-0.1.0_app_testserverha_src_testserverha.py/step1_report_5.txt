{
  "purpose": "Defines a FastMCP server instance and registers a tool function that returns a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it imports a module and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the function simply returns a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a library, creates an instance with a static string parameter, and defines a simple function that returns a greeting. No external data input, no network operations, and no security-sensitive actions are visible. The use of decorators suggests tool registration but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for plugin or extension setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code sets up a basic server tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward implementation for registering a utility function.",
