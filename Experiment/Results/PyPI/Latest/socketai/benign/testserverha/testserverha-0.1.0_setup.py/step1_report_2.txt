{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'testserverha' that uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package requirements and metadata",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; primarily configuration and file reading",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setting package configuration -> installing dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file to include a long description, which is standard practice. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, license, and dependencies. The dependencies listed are typical third-party packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to common setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
