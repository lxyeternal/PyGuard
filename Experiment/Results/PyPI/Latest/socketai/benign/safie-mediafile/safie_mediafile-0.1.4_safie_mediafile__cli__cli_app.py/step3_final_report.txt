  "purpose": "CLI utility to download media files from Safie devices, handling time parsing, validation, and async download invocation.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (start_time, end_time, serial, name, output_path, api_token, base_url, timezone_str), environment variable SAFIE_TOKEN",
  "sinks": "The external async function 'download_media_from_device' which performs network operations",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation and parsing -> async download function call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles ISO8601 time strings with timezone support, validates required parameters, generates output filename if absent, and invokes an external async download function. No malicious or insecure patterns are present. Error handling is straightforward. External function's security cannot be assessed but is presumed legitimate. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure CLI utility for media download with no signs of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's structure and purpose.",
