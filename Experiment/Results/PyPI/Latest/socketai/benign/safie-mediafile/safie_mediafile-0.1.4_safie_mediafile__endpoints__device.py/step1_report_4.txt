{
  "purpose": "Provide API operations for device management within the Safie media file system",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as serial, name, offset, limit, and data retrieved from the SafieClient's network responses",
  "sinks": "Response from network calls (self._client.get), usage of input parameters in network requests, and data returned by functions",
  "flows": "Input parameters (serial, name) influence network requests; network responses are processed to find device IDs; functions return device IDs or raise errors based on data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs typical API interaction and data filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code provides async functions to list devices and find device IDs by serial or name, using network calls via self._client. Data is fetched and filtered without suspicious or malicious operations. No untrusted data is executed or used in insecure ways. The input parameters are standard identifiers, and the data flow involves typical network requests and JSON response processing. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions include proper error handling and use standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client for device management with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It performs standard network requests and data filtering securely.",
