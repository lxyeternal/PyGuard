{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for the safie-mediafile package, with fallback messaging if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports a module and handles missing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only conditionally defines and calls main().",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard dependency handling and user messaging; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a main function from a local module '_cli_app'. If the import fails, it defines a fallback main() that prints an informational message and exits. The pattern is a typical dependency check for CLI applications. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward: it ensures that the CLI runs only if dependencies are installed, otherwise provides guidance. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency check and user messaging pattern for a CLI tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
