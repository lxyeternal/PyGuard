{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import and invoke the main function from a local CLI application module, or defines a fallback main function that prompts the user to install missing dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __main__ block which calls main().",
  "sinks": "The main() function call in the __main__ block is a sink; if main() had untrusted data, it could lead to malicious actions. The fallback main() only prints a message and exits.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import statement (source) to the call to main() in the __main__ block (sink). If the import succeeds, the imported main() executes; otherwise, the fallback main() runs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The fallback main() function merely displays a message and terminates.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a main function from a local module _cli_app. If unavailable, it defines a simple main() that prints an error message and exits. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The fallback does not perform any harmful actions. The code structure is standard, with a typical __main__ guard. There is no external data input handling beyond the import statement, and no untrusted data flows are present. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended to provide CLI functionality or an error message.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with a fallback error message. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is safe.",
