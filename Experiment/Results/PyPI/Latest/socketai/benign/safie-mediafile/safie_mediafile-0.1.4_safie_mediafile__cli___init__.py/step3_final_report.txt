{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a main function from a local module '_cli_app'. If the import fails, it defines a fallback main() that prints an error message and exits, providing a graceful handling of missing dependencies for a CLI application.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from ._cli_app import main' and the fallback function definition within the except block.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() in the '__main__' block, which executes the imported or fallback main() function.",
  "flows": "The import attempt (source) to the main() call (sink); if import fails, the fallback main() executes, which prints a message and exits.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency management in CLI tools. It attempts to import a main function; if unavailable, it defines a fallback that informs the user and exits. When run directly, it calls main(), executing either the imported or fallback version. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious code are present. The structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The logic is correct and aligns with best practices for dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs dependency checking with user messaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
