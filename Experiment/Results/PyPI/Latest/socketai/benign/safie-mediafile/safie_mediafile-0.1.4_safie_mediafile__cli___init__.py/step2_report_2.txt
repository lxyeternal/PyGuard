  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical pattern for CLI tools that have optional dependencies.\n- It attempts to import a main function from a local module `_cli_app`.\n- If the import fails (due to missing dependencies), it defines a fallback `main()` that prints an informative message and exits.\n- When run directly, it calls `main()`.\n- No external input, no data flows, no external network connections.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard dependency check and messaging.\n- Logical correctness: Accurate.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, with fallback messaging.\n- Logical correctness: Accurate.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same pattern, fallback message.\n- Logical correctness: Accurate.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Logical correctness: Accurate.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same pattern.\n- Logical correctness: Accurate.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard dependency check pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The security risk score is correctly zero, as the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a conventional pattern for handling optional CLI dependencies with fallback messaging. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
