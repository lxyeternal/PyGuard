{
  "purpose": "Provide a command line interface (CLI) entry point for the safie-mediafile package, with a fallback message if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "Reading the import of _cli_app.main, and reading sys for exit.",
  "sinks": "Calling sys.exit(1) potentially terminates the program but is standard practice; no data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import main from _cli_app; if unsuccessful, define a fallback main that prints an error and exits; if __name__ == '__main__', call main.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback main only prints an error message without executing any malicious activity; no suspicious or unusual code present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a main function from a local module. If the import fails due to missing dependencies, it defines a fallback main function that informs the user about missing dependencies and exits. The script executes main() if run directly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The logic is straightforward, handling missing dependencies gracefully. No data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI bootstrap with error handling for missing dependencies. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides user guidance when dependencies are missing, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
