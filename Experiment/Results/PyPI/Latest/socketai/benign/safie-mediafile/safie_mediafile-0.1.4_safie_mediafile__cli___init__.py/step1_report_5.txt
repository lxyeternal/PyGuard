  "purpose": "Provide a command line interface (CLI) entry point with a fallback message if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ._cli_app.main, sys module for exiting the program.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(1) used to terminate the program if dependencies are missing.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import main from _cli_app; if failed, define main() that prints a message and calls sys.exit(1).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code gracefully handles missing dependencies by printing a message and exiting.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a function main from a local module _cli_app. If unsuccessful, it defines a fallback main() that informs the user about missing dependencies and exits. The main function is invoked if the script is run directly. There are no signs of suspicious or malicious code; it is a standard pattern for optional CLI dependency handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI entry point with fallback messaging for missing dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
