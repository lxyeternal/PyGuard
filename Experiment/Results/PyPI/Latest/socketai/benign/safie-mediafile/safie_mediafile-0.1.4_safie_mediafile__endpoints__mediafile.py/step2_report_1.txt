  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward asynchronous API wrapper around a client for managing media files.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The use of print statements for debugging is noted but is not malicious.\n- Response data, URLs, and request IDs are used as expected.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n\n- The code appears correct and aligns with its described purpose.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The only minor concern is the print statement in `wait_for_mediafile_ready`, which is typical debugging output, not malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard API wrapper.\n- They acknowledge the potential for the print statement to leak info if logs are exposed, but it's not malicious.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 is assigned consistently, reflecting minimal risk mainly due to unvalidated URLs and potential info leaks via print statements. This seems reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The only slight concern is the print statement, which could expose sensitive info if logs are accessible, but this is a common debugging practice and not a security flaw per se.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur with the overall findings:**\n\n- No malicious code or supply chain risks.\n- The code is a standard API wrapper with no evident security issues.\n- The minor concern about logging can be mitigated but does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n| Aspect             | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0              | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated         | 0              | Clear, readable code; no obfuscation present.               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2            | Minimal risk; unvalidated URLs and debug print statements. |\n\n**Note:** The security risk score remains low because of potential info leaks via logs, but this is a minor operational concern, not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless logs are exposed in production, in which case the print statement should be replaced with proper logging controls.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments and scores.**",
