  "purpose": "API wrapper for managing media files via Safie devices, including creation, listing, deletion, status checking, and downloading media files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as device_id, start_time, end_time, request_id, URL, and response JSON data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data, download URL, and request IDs used for further API calls or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct API requests; responses provide status, request IDs, and URLs; download stream reads data chunks into a file.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of print statements for debugging in wait_for_mediafile_ready method; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous API client wrapping Safie media file management endpoints. It constructs requests with proper data formatting, handles responses, and streams media files. No malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The print statement in wait_for_mediafile_ready could leak internal status if logs are exposed but is not malicious. The download URL is obtained from the API response, assuming the API is trustworthy. The code does not perform any insecure operations or code injection. Overall, the code is well-structured, readable, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API wrapper with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The minor debug print statement does not constitute a security issue but should be replaced with proper logging in production. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, reflecting minimal operational concern.",
