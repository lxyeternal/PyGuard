  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n   - No external data input, processing, or output occurs.\n   - No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n   **Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n   **Suggestion:** No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or vulnerabilities, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk score is also correctly set to 0.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious intent are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- There are no security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, comprehensive, and consistent with the code. No changes or concerns are necessary.",
