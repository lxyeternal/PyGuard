  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n   - No external input, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The constructors are straightforward, mainly initializing attributes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware score: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code shows no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's nature.\n   - The scores reflect the absence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes used for error handling in an API context. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
