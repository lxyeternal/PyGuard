  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes without any data processing, external input, or network activity. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code snippets. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that the code is purely for defining exception classes, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the content. Since there's no malware or obfuscation, and the code is standard, the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   No issues warrant a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is benign and only defines exception classes, which are common in Python projects.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscated payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is for error handling and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes in Python, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no security risks.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
