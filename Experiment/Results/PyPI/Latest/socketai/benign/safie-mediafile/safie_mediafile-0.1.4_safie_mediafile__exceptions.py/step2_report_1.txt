  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic or suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify this and note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly state that the code is standard, with no anomalies or malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious code or behavior is present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.  \n   \n   The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code only defines exception classes with no external interactions, dynamic behaviors, or embedded malicious code, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   All reports are consistent, assigning zero to obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores, which is appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Personal Estimation**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an API context. There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation present. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
