  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Safie API and media file operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exception classes. The constructors are straightforward and do not execute any dynamic or unsafe operations. No input handling, data processing, or network communication occurs. The structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
