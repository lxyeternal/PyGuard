  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Safie API and media file operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor methods; no external data input or dynamic execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance with no unusual patterns or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The constructors only initialize attributes; no suspicious or malicious code is present. The code is standard, clear, and serves error handling purposes. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
