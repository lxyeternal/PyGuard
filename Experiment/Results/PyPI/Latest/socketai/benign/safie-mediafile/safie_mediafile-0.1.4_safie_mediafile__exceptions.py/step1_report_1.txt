  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Safie API and Media File operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input handling or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code. It serves as a structured way to handle errors related to the Safie API and media files. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
