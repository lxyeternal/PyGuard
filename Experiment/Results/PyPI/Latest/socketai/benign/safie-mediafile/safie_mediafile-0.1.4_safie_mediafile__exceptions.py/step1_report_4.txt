{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Safie API and media file handling errors",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exception class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling that could leak information",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with no dynamic or external data handling. The classes inherit from Exception and do not contain code that interacts with external systems, files, or network. There are no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. All classes are standard exception subclasses with no unusual patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward definition of custom exceptions for API and media file errors, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
