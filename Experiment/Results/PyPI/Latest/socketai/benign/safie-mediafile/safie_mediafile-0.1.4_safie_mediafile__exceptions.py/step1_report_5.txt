  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Safie API and media file operations",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and do not read input",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes do not process or handle untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The constructors initialize error messages and status codes, but do not perform any data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No input/output operations, network activity, or security-sensitive actions are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a part of a larger API framework for error handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining custom exception classes for structured error handling in the Safie API. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
