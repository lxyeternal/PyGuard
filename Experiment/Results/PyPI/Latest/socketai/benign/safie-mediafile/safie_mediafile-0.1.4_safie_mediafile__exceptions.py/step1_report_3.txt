  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Safie API and Media File operations",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading points",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output points",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class and exception definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, primarily for API error handling and media file errors. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no potentially malicious code. The structure is straightforward, typical of Python exception class definitions. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling within a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
