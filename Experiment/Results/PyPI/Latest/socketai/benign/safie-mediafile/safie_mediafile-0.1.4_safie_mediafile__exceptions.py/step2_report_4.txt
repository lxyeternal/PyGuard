  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes: `SafieError`, `SafieAPIError`, `SafieMediaFileError`, and `SafieMediaFileTimeoutError`.\n   - These classes inherit from Python's built-in exception classes.\n   - The `SafieAPIError` constructor accepts a message, status code, and response, but only stores them; no external calls or data processing occur.\n   - The other classes are simple subclasses with no additional logic.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving error handling purposes within a larger system.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, correct, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Malware score**: 0, correct, as no malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, appropriate, since the code is harmless and standard.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments**:\n   - The reports consistently assign a risk of 0 and malware of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The purpose of the code is straightforward, and no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's scope.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or suggestions**:\n   - The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no security risks.",
