{
  "purpose": "Provides async functions to create, wait for, download, and delete media files via Safie API, and to retrieve device IDs based on serial or name.",
  "sources": "API calls within create_mediafile, wait_for_mediafile_ready, download_mediafile, delete_mediafile_request, and find_device_id functions; print statements logging request IDs, URLs, and device info.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting request IDs, download URLs, device IDs, and API tokens; potential exposure of sensitive operational info in logs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (device_id, start_time, end_time, api_token, serial, name) flow into API calls; print statements output internal IDs and URLs; API responses (request_id, download_url) are used for subsequent API calls and logs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements to log sensitive info such as request IDs, URLs, device IDs, and API tokens; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async API wrapper for Safie services, with standard API interactions and no malicious behavior. The print statements, while exposing internal IDs and URLs, do not indicate malicious intent but pose minor security concerns if logs are accessible. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to info leakage in logs. The code's logic is clear, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The primary recommendation is to replace print statements with secure logging practices to prevent sensitive info exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client wrapper with no malicious intent. The only minor security concern is logging sensitive operational data, which should be addressed by replacing print statements with secure logging. Overall, the code is safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk of 0.2.",
