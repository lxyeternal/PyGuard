  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API client wrapper for Safie services, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The main concern across multiple reports is the use of print statements that expose sensitive information such as request IDs, download URLs, device IDs, and API tokens. While not malicious, this could pose security or privacy risks if logs are exposed or mishandled.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity is detected.\n- The code's logic and flow are consistent with legitimate API interactions, including resource cleanup and error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The only \"issue\" is the exposure of sensitive information via print statements, which is a security best practice concern but not a functional bug or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- **No factual errors or logical flaws** are present in the reports. They correctly identify the purpose, data flow, and potential concerns related to logging sensitive info.\n- The reports appropriately dismiss any claims of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.2, citing the exposure of sensitive info via print statements. This is reasonable but not critical. It could be improved with a note to replace print statements with secure logging.\n\n- **Risk Score (overall):**  \n  Given the lack of actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n\n- **Exposed Sensitive Data:**  \n  The main concern is the print statements that output request IDs, URLs, device IDs, and API tokens. While these are not malicious, they could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed.\n\n- **No Hardcoded Secrets or Backdoors:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the absence of hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n\n- **Potential for Improvement:**  \n  Replacing print statements with proper logging with appropriate log levels (e.g., debug or info) and ensuring logs are secured.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (correct, considering info leakage via logs)\n\n**Additional comments:**  \nThe code appears secure and legitimate. The only enhancement would be to replace print statements with a secure logging framework to prevent sensitive info leakage.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to info exposure in logs)  \n\nThe code is safe and functions as intended. The minor concern is the logging of sensitive info, which should be addressed for production use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate API client wrapper with no malicious intent. The only issue is the use of print statements for logging sensitive data, which should be replaced with secure, controlled logging. No changes to malware or obfuscated scores are necessary.",
