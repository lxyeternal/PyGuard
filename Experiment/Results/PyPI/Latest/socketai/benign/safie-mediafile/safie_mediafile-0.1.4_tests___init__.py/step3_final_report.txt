  "purpose": "Marker files for Python package structure, specifically empty __init__.py files used to designate directories as packages.",
  "sources": "N/A (no code or data reading; only comments present)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flows, as the files contain only comments)",
  "anomalies": "None; files are empty with only a comment, serving as package markers",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the files as empty __init__.py files used solely for package structure. There are no executable statements, data flows, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, standard purpose of these files. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present, and the content aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The files are harmless package marker files with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, thorough, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
