{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to fetch and format real-time weather data for a specified city using the Amap API and serve it through a FastMCP server.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'city' argument in the get_weather function, which is used to request weather information from the API.",
  "sinks": "Outputs weather data or error messages via return statements and the server's response. No direct data leaks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'city' flows into make_amap_request via API call parameters; API response data flows into format_weather for presentation, then back to the user.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than the API key, which is necessary for API access. No suspicious code or unusual language features are present. Use of async HTTP requests is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical API request to a trusted service with appropriate error handling. The API key is stored as a constant, which is common but should be managed securely in production. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. No network connections or actions suggest data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The server setup and API usage appear legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward weather data retrieval service without malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. Proper security practices regarding API key management are recommended but not inherently malicious.",
