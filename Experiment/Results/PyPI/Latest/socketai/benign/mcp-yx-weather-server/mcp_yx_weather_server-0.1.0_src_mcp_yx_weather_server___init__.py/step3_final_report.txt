  "purpose": "A minimal Python script with a main() function printing a static message, intended as a simple greeting or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, environment variables, or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static function that prints a message. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no external data, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. No logical errors or security concerns are evident. The code's minimalism and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified, accurately reflecting the benign nature of this simple script.",
