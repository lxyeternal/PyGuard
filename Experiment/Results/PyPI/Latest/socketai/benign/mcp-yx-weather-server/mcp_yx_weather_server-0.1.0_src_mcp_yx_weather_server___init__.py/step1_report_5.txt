  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious code segments or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that outputs a static greeting message. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, and no complex logic. The code does not interact with files, network, environment variables, or other system resources. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign script with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely outputs a greeting message and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
