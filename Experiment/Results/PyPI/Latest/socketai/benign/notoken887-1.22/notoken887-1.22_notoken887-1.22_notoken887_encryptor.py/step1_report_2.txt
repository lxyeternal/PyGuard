{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to provide a simple obfuscation mechanism for tokens through substitution and reversal, possibly for encoding or obscuring token data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input tokens from method parameters 'token' and 'encrypted_token' in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network, nor does it execute commands or handle sensitive data beyond transforming input tokens.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed using substitution tables and reversed, then reconstructed during decryption using reverse substitution and reversal.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs reversible character substitution with no external dependencies or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. The encoding scheme appears simple and transparent, with no code injection or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward character substitution cipher combined with string reversal. 'encrypt' reverses the input string, substitutes characters, and prefixes with 'ENC#'. 'decrypt' removes the prefix if present, reverses the string, and applies the reverse substitution. There are no external data inputs besides the method parameters, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation beyond the basic substitution and reversal. The design appears intended for simple obfuscation rather than security. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign obfuscation utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Its simplicity suggests it is not intended for harmful purposes.",
