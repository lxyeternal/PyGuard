  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and deobfuscation of tokens through character replacement and string reversal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for encrypt() and decrypt() methods: 'token' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing obfuscated or deobfuscated strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'token' -> encryption table transformation -> reversal -> output; Input 'encrypted_token' -> reverse, check prefix -> decryption table transformation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no external network access, no suspicious data handling or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple character substitution and string reversal for obfuscation. The 'encrypt' method transforms the input token using a predefined table, reverses it, and adds a 'ENC#' prefix. The 'decrypt' method reverses the process based on the presence of the prefix, reversing the string and applying the decryption table. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, serving as a basic obfuscation tool rather than malware or a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign obfuscation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or access external systems. It appears to be a simple encoding scheme for tokens.",
