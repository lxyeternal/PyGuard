  "purpose": "This class provides methods for simple token encryption and decryption using character substitution and string reversal.",
  "sources": "Input tokens provided to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The transformed token output from encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed via character replacement, reversed, and possibly prefixed with 'ENC#'. The decrypt method reverses these steps depending on the format.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic character substitution and reversals, with no external data handling, network communication, or access to sensitive information. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple substitution cipher with reversible transformations. The encrypt method replaces certain characters, reverses the string, and adds a prefix 'ENC#'. The decrypt method detects this prefix, reverses the string back, and applies the reverse substitution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward and only manipulates strings based on internal mappings.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a basic reversible character substitution cipher with string reversal, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve as an obfuscation or encoding mechanism rather than malicious code.",
