{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for simple token encryption and decryption using substitution and reversal techniques.",
  "sources": "Input tokens for encryption or decryption, typically external data passed to encrypt() or decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns the transformed tokens; no external data sinks or outputs are directly involved in the code.",
  "flows": "Input token -> (encryption or decryption logic) -> output transformed token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external dependencies or system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward character substitutions based on defined tables and reverses strings during encryption and decryption. The functions are simple, deterministic, and do not involve external system calls, network access, or storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The encoding scheme appears to be for obfuscation or basic token transformation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple cipher implementation for token transformation, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign, serving a likely purpose of obscuring token values with no harmful side effects.",
