  "purpose": "A simple reversible token obfuscation utility that performs character substitution and string reversal for encoding and decoding tokens.",
  "sources": "Input tokens provided to encrypt/decrypt methods, specifically the 'token' parameter in 'encrypt' and 'encrypted_token' in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "Output of 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input token -> character substitution via 'replacement_table' -> string reversal -> optional 'ENC#' prefix -> output; for decryption, reverse process based on prefix presence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with simple substitution tables and reversal operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods for encoding and decoding tokens. 'encrypt' replaces characters based on 'replacement_table', reverses the string, and adds a prefix. 'decrypt' removes the prefix if present, reverses the string, and applies 'decryption_table'. The operations are deterministic, with no external dependencies, network activity, or malicious code. The substitution tables are simple and reversible. The code's logic is transparent and intended solely for obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward token obfuscation utility performing character substitution and string reversal. No malicious or security-threatening features are present. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
