  "purpose": "The class provides simple token encryption and decryption using character substitution and string reversal.",
  "sources": "Input tokens to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encrypt and decrypt methods; no external output or data storage.",
  "flows": "Input tokens are transformed via substitution and reversal in both methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no external network activity, no obfuscated code, and no apparent malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines substitution tables for encoding and decoding tokens. Encryption involves character substitution followed by reversal; decryption reverses the process. No external data sources, no system calls, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The logic appears straightforward and benign, intended for simple token obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The only potential concern is that this is a simple obfuscation mechanism, but it does not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic token obfuscation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a simple encoding scheme without harmful features.",
