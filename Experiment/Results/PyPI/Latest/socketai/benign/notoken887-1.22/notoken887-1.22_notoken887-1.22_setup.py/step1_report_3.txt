  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package info such as name, version, author details, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (package info) is used to configure package setup; no untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The author email is a well-known provocative email address ('hitler@gmail.com'); package name 'notoken887' and description seem unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script using setuptools. It contains no dynamic code, no user input handling, and no suspicious code or behavior. The author email and package details are potentially inappropriate but do not constitute malicious code. No hidden or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The suspicious elements are related to content choices (e.g., email), not code behavior.",
