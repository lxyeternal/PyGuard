  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, including name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') are provocative but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The only notable concern is the provocative contact info, which is behavioral, not technical. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the benign code but reflect metadata concerns. The code itself is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is the provocative metadata, which could be used for social engineering outside the code context but does not pose a technical security threat. The scores are consistent with this assessment. I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) to account for metadata concerns.",
