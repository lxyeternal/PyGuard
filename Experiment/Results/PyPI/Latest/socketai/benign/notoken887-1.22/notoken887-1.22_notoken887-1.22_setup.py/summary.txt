  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is the provocative metadata, which could be used for social engineering outside the code context but does not pose a technical security threat. The scores are consistent with this assessment. I recommend maintaining malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) to account for metadata concerns."
