  "flows": "Static string output directly to console; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple print statement with a static message. No external input, network activity, or data processing occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The message is benign and informational. The assigned scores in all reports are consistent with this benign nature, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
