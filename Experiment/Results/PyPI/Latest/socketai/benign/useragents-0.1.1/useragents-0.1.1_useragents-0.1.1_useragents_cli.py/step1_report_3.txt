{
  "purpose": "Placeholder for command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or data sources; the cli() function is empty and not implemented.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as no data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs because the cli() function is empty and not invoked with any parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains no unusual constructs, secrets, or suspicious patterns. The try-except block only handles KeyboardInterrupt with a debug log, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an empty cli() function and calls it within a try-except block that catches KeyboardInterrupt, logging a debug message. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no output or network activity. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a scaffold or template for a CLI application, with no implementation details that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, acting as a minimal scaffold for a command-line interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
