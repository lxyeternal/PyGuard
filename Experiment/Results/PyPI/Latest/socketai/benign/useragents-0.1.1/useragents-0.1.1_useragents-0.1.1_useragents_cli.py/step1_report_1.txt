{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function 'cli' with no implemented logic, intended for command-line interface handling.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; no input or data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows since the 'cli' function is empty and no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The 'cli' function is empty; the try-except block only logs a debug message upon KeyboardInterrupt but does not perform any meaningful operation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli' function and wraps its invocation in a try-except block that captures KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, logging a debug message when such an interruption occurs. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be a minimal stub or placeholder for future command-line interface logic. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets up a structure for a CLI application but lacks any substantive logic or external interactions.",
