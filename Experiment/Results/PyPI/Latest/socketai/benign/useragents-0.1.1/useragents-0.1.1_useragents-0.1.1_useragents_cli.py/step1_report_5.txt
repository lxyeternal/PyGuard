{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function for command-line interface handling",
  "sources": "The code reads the script's execution context (via the '__name__' check) and potentially logs during a KeyboardInterrupt exception",
  "sinks": "Logging output occurs during exception handling; no other data sinks are present",
  "flows": "The code flows from script execution to the 'cli()' function call, with exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt, which may trigger logging",
  "anomalies": "The 'cli()' function is empty and does nothing; logging is used only in exception handling but 'logging' module is not imported, indicating incomplete code",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'cli()' function intended for CLI logic. During script execution, it attempts to run 'cli()', and if interrupted by a keyboard signal, it logs a debug message. However, the 'logging' module is not imported, suggesting this code snippet is incomplete or a placeholder. There are no input sources, no data flows involving untrusted data, and no malicious behavior or suspicious code present. The structure is minimal and contains no malicious constructs or obfuscated logic. It appears to be a scaffold for future development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic placeholder with minimal structure, lacking any actual logic, data handling, or malicious behavior. No security risks are present, but the code is incomplete or a stub.",
