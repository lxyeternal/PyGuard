  "purpose": "A placeholder function for command-line interface handling.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the function is empty and only called within a try-except block.",
  "anomalies": "The cli() function is empty, and the exception handling only logs a debug message without performing any other actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty cli() function, which is called within a try block. The except block catches KeyboardInterrupt and logs a debug message. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The structure is minimal and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a stub or placeholder with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial, non-malicious code snippet serving as a placeholder for CLI logic. It does not contain any suspicious activity or security risks.",
