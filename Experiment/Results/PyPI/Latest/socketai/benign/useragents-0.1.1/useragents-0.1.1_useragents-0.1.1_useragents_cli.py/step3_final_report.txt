{
  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder CLI script with an empty function and exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code reads no external data or input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code contains no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Missing 'import logging' despite using 'logging.debug' in exception handler; indicates incomplete code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign scaffold with an empty 'cli()' function and a main block that calls it within a try-except for KeyboardInterrupt. The only issue is the missing import of 'logging', which would cause a runtime error but does not imply malicious intent. No data processing, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's minimal and placeholder nature. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty of benign intent. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The missing import is a minor implementation oversight. The existing scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
