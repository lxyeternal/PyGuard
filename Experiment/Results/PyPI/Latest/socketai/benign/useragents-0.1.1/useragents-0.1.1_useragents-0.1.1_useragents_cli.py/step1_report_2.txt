{
  "purpose": "Placeholder CLI function with no implemented functionality",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the '__main__' block and the 'cli()' function (which is currently empty).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present, as 'cli()' does nothing and there are no data sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as 'cli()' is empty and no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with a try-except block for KeyboardInterrupt, but contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an empty 'cli()' function, then calls it within a try-except block to handle keyboard interrupts, logging a message upon exit. No data input/output, no third-party dependencies, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a stub or scaffold for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a placeholder for a CLI application with minimal structure. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
