  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'useragents' with custom post-installation commands.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from package metadata, command-line arguments, and potential environment variables (not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly present; no data leaks, system calls, or external network connections are made.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily raises exceptions and prints messages during setup.",
  "anomalies": "The run methods in custom commands raise exceptions with non-standard messages, which could be considered unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom setup commands that intentionally raise exceptions with messages indicating a possible misinstallation or misuse. These exceptions prevent normal installation procedures. The code does not perform any network activity, data collection, or system modification. Usage of standard setup tools and harmless print statements suggest no malicious intent. The custom commands seem to serve as warnings or gatekeeping, possibly for development or debugging purposes. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with intentional exception raising in custom commands, likely as a safeguard or reminder. There is no evidence of malicious code, malware, or security risks within this module.",
