{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'useragents' Python package, defining custom post-installation commands and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, package information, and imports from standard libraries; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks are present. The code does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data. The exception raises could be considered control flow interruptions but are based on static strings.",
  "anomalies": "The run methods in custom commands intentionally raise exceptions with specific messages, which is unusual in setup scripts but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom setup commands that intentionally raise exceptions with messages suggesting misusage ('You probably meant to install and run user-agents'). These are static, hardcoded strings used for control flow interruption rather than malicious activity. The package setup metadata appears normal, and there are no external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The code structure is typical of a Python package setup with custom commands, but the exception raising could prevent proper installation if invoked. However, there is no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The exception raises are unusual but serve as control flow checks or user guidance rather than harmful actions. No security risks are detected, and the package appears safe for use.",
