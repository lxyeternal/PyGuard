{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and enums for musical note calculations, including note representation, interval operations, and note semitone offset computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from string representations of notes, such as 'C4', 'D#5', and from user-defined function calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that return sets of notes based on semitone calculations, but no direct data leakage or unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into Note objects; NoteInOctave objects compute semitone offsets; operations like addition with intervals modify notes; data flows from string input to musical note representations and calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard enum and class structures for musical computations. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation of musical note and interval mathematics, with proper validation and logical flow. It uses standard Python features and does not include any malicious or suspicious operations. All data processing appears legitimate and intended for musical computations. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden functionalities are present. The only potential concern could be incorrect assumptions about input data, but that does not relate to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for musical note calculations with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is minimal.",
