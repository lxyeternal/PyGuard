{
  "purpose": "Defines classes, enums, and methods for musical note representation, parsing, semitone calculations, and note arithmetic in a domain-specific manner.",
  "sources": "String parsing for note input, set comprehensions for generating notes from semitone offsets, internal calculations of semitone offsets and note relations.",
  "sinks": "None; all operations are in-memory calculations without external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings → Note objects → semitone offset calculations → note arithmetic and set generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is transparent and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code models musical notes and intervals using enums and classes, performs string parsing to create notes, calculates semitone offsets, and supports note addition via intervals. It uses standard Python features, assertions, and set comprehensions. No external system calls, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The logic aligns with music theory, and the code structure is clear and straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of musical note calculations with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening features. It is safe for use in musical applications, and the low security risk scores are justified.",
