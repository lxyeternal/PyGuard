{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a comprehensive set of unit tests for a music theory library, validating note operations, interval arithmetic, and note equivalences.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string inputs representing musical notes and intervals, and uses these to generate Note, NoteInOctave, and NoteLetter objects.",
  "sinks": "Assertions compare the output of functions and operators to expected results; no untrusted data is written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted into note objects; operations like addition/subtraction, and equality checks produce outputs compared against hardcoded expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs detected. No network, file system, or external data access present. Code relies solely on library functions and local assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a series of unit tests for a music theory library. It tests arithmetic operations (+, -), equality, semitone calculations, note conversion, and note addition with intervals. All data is hardcoded within the tests, and no external data or malicious constructs are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward and aligned with standard unit testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign unit tests validating a music theory library. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
