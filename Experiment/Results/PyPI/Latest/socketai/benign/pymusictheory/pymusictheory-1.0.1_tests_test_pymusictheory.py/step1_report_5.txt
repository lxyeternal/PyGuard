{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for music theory classes and functions related to musical notes and intervals.",
  "sources": "Test data inputs such as string representations of notes, intervals, and notes in octaves; method calls on these objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner; code primarily performs calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data (string notes, intervals) -> object creation and method calls (e.g., from_str, addition) -> comparisons/assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests verifying the correctness of music theory classes. It uses controlled test inputs to check object behavior, equality, and arithmetic operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data leaks, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors. All operations are confined within well-defined test functions, primarily performing arithmetic and equality assertions on note objects. No external system interactions or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard test code for music theory objects with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected calculations and assertions without any suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
