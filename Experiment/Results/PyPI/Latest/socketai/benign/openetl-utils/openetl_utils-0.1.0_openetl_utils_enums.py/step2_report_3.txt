  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string values assigned to members.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- The code appears to be purely structural, intended for use as constants within a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, safe, and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None observed.\n- **Reasoning flaws:** The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which is accurate given the static enum definitions.\n- **Summary:** No mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static enum definitions with no external input, dynamic code, or data manipulation, the risk scores are correctly low (0).\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward set of enum definitions used for configuration and status representation. There are no security concerns, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard enum definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk given the static nature)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or code present                               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward enum definitions                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, no external data handling, static constants    |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, standard, and poses no security issues.",
