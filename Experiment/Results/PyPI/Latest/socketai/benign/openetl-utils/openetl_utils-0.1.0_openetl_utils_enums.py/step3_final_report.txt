  "purpose": "Define various configuration and status constants using enum classes for use throughout the system.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions with string constants; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static definitions used as constants within other modules.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string values, serving as constants for authentication types, connection types, table actions, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and log types. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The code is static, clear, and standard, with no signs of security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues. It functions solely as a set of constants for use in larger applications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the static, transparent nature of the code.",
