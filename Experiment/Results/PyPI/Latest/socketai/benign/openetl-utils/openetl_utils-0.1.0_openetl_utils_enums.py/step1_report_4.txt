{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for authentication, connection types, table actions, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and log types to standardize and organize related constants in a system.",
  "sources": "Constant string values assigned within each Enum class",
  "sinks": "No data flows from external sources; no untrusted data handling or external input processing present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines static enums",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Enum class definitions with string constants representing various system states and actions. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic are present. The purpose appears to be standardization of constants for use elsewhere in an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of Enum classes used for system constants. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
