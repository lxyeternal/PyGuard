  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of enum class definitions containing static string constants.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for internal configuration or status representation.\n\n**Assessment of the code's actual content:**\n- The code is straightforward, using Python's Enum class to define constants.\n- There are no dynamic operations, input/output handling, or external interactions.\n- The string values are standard, descriptive, and do not contain suspicious or obfuscated content.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the code's benign and static nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all conclusions are justified.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign set of enum definitions used for organizing constants within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate and thorough.",
