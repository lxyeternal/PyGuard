  "purpose": "Definition of various enumeration classes for configuration and operational states within a larger application or system.",
  "sources": "None; all data is defined as string literals within Enum classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink due to static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of Enum class definitions with string values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Enum classes representing different categories such as authentication types, connection types, table actions, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and log types. All classes use standard Enum syntax with string values. There are no dynamic operations, input/output processing, or security-sensitive functions. The code is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of Enum class definitions intended for use as constants within a larger application. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code, and no signs of security risks. The code is safe and standard for configuration purposes.",
