  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for authentication types, connection types, table actions, column actions, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and log types used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "N/A - the code contains only class definitions and string literals.",
  "sinks": "N/A - there are no data flows or input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple enum class definitions for standard application constants. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows. The string literals used are straightforward and correspond to common terminology. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be purely declarative and intended for internal use in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of enum definitions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The risk is minimal.",
