{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumeration classes for authentication types, connection types, database actions, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and log types.",
  "sources": "The code reads from enum class definitions and string assignments within enum members.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified, as the code only defines static enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. The enum values are simple strings with no dynamic or suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions, providing named constants for various application states and types. All enum values are static strings; there are no dynamic code executions, input/output operations, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and follows typical enum usage patterns, indicating no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of enumeration definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no external data handling, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious activity.",
