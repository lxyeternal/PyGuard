{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for configuration and status representation in a system, likely related to authentication, connection types, database operations, API methods, run statuses, integration types, and logging.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data are hardcoded string constants within enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; code solely defines enums without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs observed. Usage of Enum class and string assignments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string values assigned to members. There are no external input reads, no data manipulation, and no sensitive information handling. The code appears to be purely structural, facilitating organized use of constants within a larger system. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of enum definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard and safe for use in applications to manage constants and statuses.",
