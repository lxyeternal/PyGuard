  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard database utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score reflects the inherent risk of executing untrusted SQL, which is typical for such utilities but does not indicate malicious intent."
