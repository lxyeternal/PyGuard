  "purpose": "A utility class for managing SQLAlchemy database connections, executing queries, retrieving metadata, and reading/writing data in a database-agnostic manner.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'query' in execute_query, data in write_data, and table names in read_table; external modules for library installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of arbitrary SQL queries via execute_query; data returned in pandas DataFrames; potential for data leaks or injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SQL execution or data retrieval functions; data is fetched into pandas DataFrames; external dependencies are installed as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; reliance on parent class methods without their implementation details; potential SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but this is typical for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around SQLAlchemy functions, designed for database connection management, query execution, and data operations. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is executing arbitrary SQL via 'execute_query', which could be exploited if untrusted input is passed, but this is standard for such utility modules. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. External utility functions like 'install_libraries' are used for dependency management and are considered benign. The code's structure and logic are clear and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard database utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score reflects the inherent risk of executing untrusted SQL, which is typical for such utilities but does not indicate malicious intent.",
