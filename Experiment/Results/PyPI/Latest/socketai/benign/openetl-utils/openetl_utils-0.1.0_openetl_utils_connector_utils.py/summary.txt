  "conclusion": "While the code does not contain embedded malicious code, its architecture—dynamic module loading from untrusted sources and executing system commands without validation—poses high security risks. The potential for malicious exploitation exists if external modules are compromised or inputs are manipulated. Therefore, the overall security risk is high, but no active malware is present in the code itself."
