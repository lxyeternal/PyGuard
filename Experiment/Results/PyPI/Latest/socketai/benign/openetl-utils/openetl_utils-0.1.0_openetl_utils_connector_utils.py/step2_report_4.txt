  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core issues, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides utility functions for dynamic module import, connection testing, and metadata retrieval, using environment variables and filesystem.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes imported module functions, with potential for malicious code if modules are compromised. Uses environment variables and dynamic paths.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of importlib with filesystem paths based on external input is risky. No validation of connector names or paths. The subprocess call for 'pip install' does not verify package sources, risking supply chain attacks. Error messages could leak sensitive info.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly identifies the inherent risks in dynamic code execution and external package installation. The overall risk score of 0.45 seems reasonable, given no evidence of malicious code but high potential for exploitation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code, just risky practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on dynamic loading and subprocess calls.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights high risk of arbitrary code execution via dynamic import and subprocess.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of `spec_from_file_location` and `exec_module` to load modules from unvalidated paths is dangerous. The subprocess call for pip install with untrusted input is a major concern. Error messages may leak internal info.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly emphasizes the high security risk (0.9) and malware potential (0.8). These scores are justified given the dynamic import methods and subprocess vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.8 — high likelihood of malicious exploitation if modules are compromised.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dynamic import and execution pattern, with focus on connection management.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import, class instantiation, and subprocess calls for pip install.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Dynamic import from user-controlled paths and subprocess execution without validation pose significant risks. Error handling exposes internal info.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.6 and malware of 0.0, noting no evidence of malicious code but acknowledging the potential for misuse.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code, just risky practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on dynamic module loading and subprocess calls.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import, class instantiation, and external command execution.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of `spec_from_file_location` and `exec_module` from untrusted paths, plus subprocess calls for pip install, both pose security risks. No validation or integrity checks.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's risk score of 0.75 and malware score of 0.5 are justified, considering the potential for malicious module placement and command execution.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.5 — moderate risk, potential for malicious behavior if exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dynamic loading and subprocess usage.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import, class instantiation, and external command execution.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Same concerns as above; unvalidated paths and commands.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Risk score of 0.6 and malware score of 0.25 are reasonable, given the potential but no explicit malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.25 — lower risk, but still notable.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly reflect low to moderate malware potential, given the code's structure. The highest (0.8) in report 2 accurately captures the high risk of malicious module execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores are consistent with the described vulnerabilities. Higher scores correspond to higher potential for exploitation via dynamic import and subprocess calls.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** ~0.75  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** ~0.75\n\n**Rationale:** The core concern is the use of dynamic module loading from untrusted paths and executing subprocess commands without validation, which can lead to remote code execution or supply chain attacks if exploited. While no malicious code is present in the static code itself, the architecture's vulnerabilities are significant.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are justified based on the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The primary concern is the potential for malicious exploitation through dynamic code loading and external command execution.",
