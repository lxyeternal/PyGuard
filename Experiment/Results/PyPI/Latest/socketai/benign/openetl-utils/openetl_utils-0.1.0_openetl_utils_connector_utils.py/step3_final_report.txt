{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dynamic module import, connection testing, metadata retrieval, and data fetching from connectors, relying on environment variables, filesystem, and user parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., OPENETL_HOME), filesystem paths, user input parameters for connector names and types.",
  "sinks": "Execution of imported module functions, class instantiation, subprocess calls for pip installations, print statements for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import from filesystem paths based on environment variables, followed by execution of functions or class constructors; subprocess calls with unvalidated input; error messages printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.util to load modules from arbitrary paths without validation; subprocess calls to pip with untrusted input; reliance on environment variables without sanitization; no input validation or sanitization for connector names or paths.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads modules from filesystem paths derived from environment variables and user inputs, which could be manipulated to load malicious modules. The subprocess calls for pip installation are executed without validation, risking supply chain attacks. Error messages are printed directly, potentially leaking sensitive info. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present in the code itself, but the design pattern introduces significant security risks. The reliance on external modules and dynamic code execution without validation makes the system vulnerable to remote code execution and supply chain exploits.",
  "conclusion": "While the code does not contain embedded malicious code, its architecture—dynamic module loading from untrusted sources and executing system commands without validation—poses high security risks. The potential for malicious exploitation exists if external modules are compromised or inputs are manipulated. Therefore, the overall security risk is high, but no active malware is present in the code itself.",
