  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nThe reports all indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since no specific details are provided, I cannot verify any particular vulnerabilities, errors, or malicious activity from the reports. The code snippet itself appears to be a standard utility module with import statements and a logo display function.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports contain no content or detailed findings; they are placeholders with \"Empty response.\"  \n- Without specific issues, I cannot identify logical flaws or mistakes in the report reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- Since no issues are described, no scores are provided or can be evaluated.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No issues are detailed, so no risk scores are assigned or justified.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The code does not contain any apparent malicious logic—no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports, and no malicious behavior evident from the snippet.\n- Given the lack of detailed reports, I cannot assign a high malware score.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- Without specific claims or evidence, I cannot challenge any assumptions.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- Since no issues are reported, the default assumption should be that the code is safe, with low or zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code appears to be a benign utility module. The import statements are standard, and the logo display is purely aesthetic.\n- **Reported issues:** None provided; thus, no vulnerabilities or malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- **Scores:** Given the absence of issues, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be very low, close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Request more detailed reports or specific issues if any are suspected.\n- Continue monitoring for suspicious activity, but based on the current information, the code appears safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated Score | 0.0             |\n| Risk Score       | 0.1 (minimal, default) |\n\nThis conservative estimate reflects the lack of evidence for any malicious or risky behavior.",
