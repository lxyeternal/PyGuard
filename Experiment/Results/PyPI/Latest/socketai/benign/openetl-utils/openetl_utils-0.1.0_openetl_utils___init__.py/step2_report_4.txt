  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code snippet is primarily import statements and a function `_print_logo()` that displays branding information.\n   - There are no apparent security issues, malicious code, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - The commented-out imports (`connector_utils`, `pipeline_utils`, `celery_utils`) could suggest incomplete or modular code, but their absence does not indicate a security concern.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis**:\n   - All five reports contain only the message `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no additional details.\n   - The lack of raw response data or context makes it impossible to identify specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n   - Since the reports are empty, there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws in the reports themselves.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports lack content; therefore, any assumptions about security issues based solely on these reports would be unfounded.\n   - It is important to verify whether the reports are incomplete or if the issue was not properly captured.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - Given the absence of detailed information, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated code score should also be **0**, as there's no evidence of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - Without concrete data, any claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are purely speculative.\n   - The empty responses could indicate an issue with report collection or a lack of detected problems.\n\n6. **Summary & Recommendations**:\n   - No security issues are evident from the code snippet or the reports.\n   - It would be prudent to gather more detailed reports or logs to perform a thorough security assessment.\n   - The current scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated code, and risk.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated code score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Note**: Continue monitoring for more detailed reports or logs to ensure no underlying issues are missed.",
