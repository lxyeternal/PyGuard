  "purpose": "This code initializes a utility module with import statements and displays a branding logo and contact information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and the _print_logo() function which outputs static branding text.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only prints static information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static and display-oriented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a function that prints a logo and contact info. The reports provided are empty, indicating no detected issues or suspicious activity. The code does not interact with external data, handle sensitive information, or execute untrusted input. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign. The reports' emptiness suggests either incomplete analysis or no issues found. Therefore, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or vulnerabilities. The code is benign, and the reports do not indicate any issues. Scores should be set to zero, reflecting the absence of detected threats.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
