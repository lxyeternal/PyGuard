{
  "purpose": "The code schedules and manages ETL tasks, dispatches them via Celery, interacts with a database for configuration, and performs log cleanup, ensuring automated task execution and maintenance.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OPENETL_HOME, LOG_TTL), database queries (get_integrations_to_schedule, get_created_connections), external libraries (apscheduler, Celery app), filesystem (log directory).",
  "sinks": "Database updates (update_integration, create_integration_history), task dispatch via Celery (send_task), log files (log cleanup).",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log and log directory setup; database queries provide task configurations; scheduling triggers invoke send_task_to_celery; send_task_to_celery dispatches tasks and updates database; log cleanup deletes old log files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; standard environment variable usage; no obfuscation or malicious network activity; log cleanup based on environment variable-derived TTL.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ETL scheduler with dynamic task scheduling based on database entries, task dispatch via Celery, and log maintenance. It employs environment variables for configuration, uses external libraries appropriately, and handles exceptions properly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The security posture relies on environment and database integrity, but the code itself is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured ETL scheduler with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0.2) scores are justified based on its operations and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
