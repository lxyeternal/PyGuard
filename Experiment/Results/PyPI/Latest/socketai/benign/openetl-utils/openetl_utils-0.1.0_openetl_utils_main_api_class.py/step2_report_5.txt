  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client with functions for authentication, data fetching, schema retrieval, and OAuth2 URL/token handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code raises NotImplementedError for OAuth2, indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, primarily due to incomplete OAuth2 support.\n  - **Logic & reasoning:** Correct; the code is standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential risks from lack of input validation and the external `install_libraries` function. The code is standard but lacks input sanitization, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — justified, as unvalidated inputs could be exploited.\n  - **Logic & reasoning:** Accurate; the code is typical but with some caution needed regarding input validation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on reliance on an external `install_libraries` function. No signs of malicious activity; the code is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — due to external dependency and lack of input validation.\n  - **Logic & reasoning:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on potential risks from constructing URLs and handling inputs without validation. No malicious behavior detected; incomplete OAuth2 support is noted.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — justified; potential for request manipulation if inputs are malicious.\n  - **Logic & reasoning:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with OAuth2 support, no obfuscation or malicious activity. The main concern is handling credentials via parameters, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering the handling of sensitive data via parameters.\n  - **Logic & reasoning:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API client with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk scores are 0.2 across all reports, justified by the potential risks associated with unvalidated inputs and external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 — moderate, due to lack of input validation and reliance on external functions, but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard API utility with minimal security concerns, primarily related to input validation and external dependencies. Proper validation and vetting of external functions like `install_libraries` would further mitigate risks.",
