  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API client with no malicious behavior. It handles authentication, data fetching, JSON flattening, and DataFrame creation. No obfuscation or malware is detected. The report assigns malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Score justification:** Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low because the code could be misused if inputs are malicious, but as-is, it’s safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API client with no malicious intent. It notes the lack of input validation, which could be a security concern if inputs are maliciously crafted, but does not suggest active malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains at 0, securityRisk at 0.2, consistent with the previous assessment. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard API utility. It notes reliance on an external `install_libraries` function, which could be suspicious if malicious, but without its implementation, we cannot confirm. The code does not perform harmful actions.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, consistent. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on potential risks from unsanitized URL or parameter inputs. It correctly notes that malicious inputs could lead to request manipulation but finds no malicious code.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, appropriate. No obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The highest confidence report, again confirming the code's benign nature. It emphasizes standard OAuth2 flows, no malicious network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher at 0.2, reflecting potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** — Slight risk if inputs are malicious, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate API client utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk score accounts for potential misuse via malicious inputs but does not reflect active threats.",
