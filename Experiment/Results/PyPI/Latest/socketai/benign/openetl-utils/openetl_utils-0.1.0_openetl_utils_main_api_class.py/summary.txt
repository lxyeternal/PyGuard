  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor concerns about input validation and external dependencies but does not indicate active threats. The overall security posture is acceptable for trusted environments, with recommendations to validate external functions and inputs in deployment."
