{
  "purpose": "Provide mappings of database types to connection parameters, JDBC URLs, driver classes, and dependencies for database connectivity.",
  "sources": "Data is sourced from predefined dictionaries containing connection strings, driver classes, and dependency info for various databases.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or malicious actions are present; the code is static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a static data structure without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely defines static mappings with no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration mappings for database connection parameters, JDBC URLs, driver classes, and dependencies. There is no dynamic input processing, code execution, or network activity within this snippet. All entries are straightforward mappings. No signs of malicious or sabotage activity are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration module used for establishing database connections.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign configuration resource containing mappings necessary for database connectivity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a standard, static configuration code with no security risks identified.",
