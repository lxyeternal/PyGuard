  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, static configuration data with no malicious intent. It notes no dynamic code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward data mappings with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence is high (1.0). No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static mappings, no dynamic behavior, no secrets, and benign purpose.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent and well-justified. No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The analysis aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, static configuration data, no dynamic code, no secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is purely static mappings, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting potential risks if connection string templates are misused with untrusted input. It emphasizes that the code itself is static and benign but warns about usage context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** This is reasonable. While the code is benign, the potential for injection or misuse exists if the templates are improperly handled elsewhere. The securityRisk score of 0.1 reflects this minimal but non-zero concern, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 4, highlighting that connection string templates could be misused if untrusted data is inserted. It notes no secrets or malicious code but advises cautious input validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Evaluation:** Slightly higher than Report 4, which is justified given the potential for injection if the templates are used improperly. The reasoning is sound, and the score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware present. The code is static configuration data.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** The only variation is in reports 4 and 5, which assign small but non-zero risks due to potential misuse of connection string templates.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The risk scores for reports 4 and 5 are reasonable, considering the potential for injection if these templates are used improperly. The scores of 0.1 and 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting minimal risk contingent on correct application usage.\n- No changes are necessary; the reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** ~0.1 (average of 0.1 and 0.2), acknowledging the potential misuse if application code mishandles the templates.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign static configuration module. The only caution is in how the templates are used in application code, which is outside the scope of this snippet. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident here.",
