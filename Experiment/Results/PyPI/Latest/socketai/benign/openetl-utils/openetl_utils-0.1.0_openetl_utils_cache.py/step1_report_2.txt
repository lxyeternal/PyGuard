{
  "purpose": "Provide mappings for various database connection parameters, JDBC URLs, driver classes, and JAR dependencies for different database systems.",
  "sources": "Definitions of database engines, JDBC driver class names, JDBC connection string templates, and JDBC driver JAR files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows directly to sensitive operations; no data processing, input handling, or output functions.",
  "flows": "The code primarily consists of static dictionaries with no executable logic or data flow processes; no source-to-sink data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or dynamic code execution; the code is a straightforward static configuration mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of static dictionaries that map database names to their respective connection URL templates, driver class names, and required JAR files. It serves as configuration data without any executable logic, input handling, or data processing functions. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The lack of dynamic or reflective code, code injection points, or data leaks suggests a benign purpose. The mappings are standard for database configuration and dependency management. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration setup for database connection parameters, drivers, and dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe configuration module.",
