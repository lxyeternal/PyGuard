  "conclusion": "The code is a benign task scheduler with proper resource management. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The execution of external tasks is a potential risk if tasks are untrusted, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe, and the security risk is minimal."
