  "purpose": "The code defines a synchronous application class for managing tasks, including starting, stopping, and running scheduled tasks with delay control.",
  "sources": "self.startup_task(), self.shutdown_task(), self.tasks (list), self.client.http_client (if present), time.sleep()",
  "sinks": "task functions called with kwargs, self.client.http_client.close()",
  "flows": "start() calls run(), which executes startup_task, sorts tasks, repeatedly executes tasks with kwargs, then calls shutdown_task, and finally closes HTTP client.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data leaks, or unusual code patterns observed. The code mainly manages task execution and resource cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages application lifecycle: starting, executing scheduled tasks, and stopping. It utilizes class inheritance, manages task list execution with sorting, and ensures HTTP client is closed properly. No untrusted data sources or insecure data handling mechanisms are evident. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears standard and intended for application orchestration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward task management class with no malicious intent. It does not contain malicious behaviors or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
