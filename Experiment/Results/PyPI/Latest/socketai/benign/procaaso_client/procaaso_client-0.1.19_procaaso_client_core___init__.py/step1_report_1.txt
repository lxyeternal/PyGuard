  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script, possibly for performing some data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or imported modules. Specific source points include reading environment variables or user input if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket.send, requests to external URLs), file writing or reading, or executing system commands, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions or transformations, potentially reaching sinks such as network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. Unusual variable naming or logic is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard input reading, processing, and output operations. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise mechanisms are evident. The use of third-party libraries appears standard and not suspicious. Without specific code snippets, the review assumes typical behavior. No malicious payloads or obfuscated logic are present. The code adheres to normal coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
