  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to lack of content; it appears to be an empty or placeholder script with no defined functionality.",
  "sources": "There are no evident sources or input points in the provided code, such as reading from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no suspicious sinks, such as network connections, file modifications, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable since the code contains no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be empty or a placeholder, with no executable statements or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sample provided is empty or contains no meaningful content, making it impossible to identify any malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues. Without actual code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. This suggests the code is either incomplete or intentionally minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of any executable or data-handling code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. The code appears benign but also non-functional. Further context or actual code is needed for a thorough review.",
