{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package module, possibly designed to perform a specific function within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly defined; no direct input functions, file reads, environment variables, or network inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, data storage, or command execution if present. However, no explicit dangerous sinks like subprocess calls, socket connections, or file modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows are apparent; code lacks clear data flow pathways from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code appears standard without obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python module with no signs of malicious intent. It uses standard syntax and structures, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Absence of network activity, secret handling, or obfuscated segments suggests no malicious behavior. The lack of clear input/output or sensitive data handling further reduces suspicion. The code does not utilize dangerous functions or exhibit anomalies typical of malware or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
