  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code fetching external data, import statements, or no code at all.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, data output, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., URL fetch) to outputs or processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual network activity, hardcoded secrets, placeholder code, or no code present.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign code snippets: standard modules, import-only files, network fetches without malicious payloads, or absence of code. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code. The network activity in one case is noted but justified as benign. Overall, the assessments are internally consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the described code snippets. No adjustments are necessary.",
