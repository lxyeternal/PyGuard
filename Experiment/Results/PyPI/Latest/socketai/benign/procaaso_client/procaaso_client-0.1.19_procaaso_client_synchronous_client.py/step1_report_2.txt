{
  "purpose": "Client wrapper for interacting with a remote system's runtime events, attribute states, and IO mappings via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP request methods (`get`, `post`) in the `http_client` object, especially in methods like `get_runtime_event`, `post_startup_event`, `post_attribute_state`, `get_attribute_state`, `get_system_io_maps_definition`, and `get_io_maps`.",
  "sinks": "HTTP response handling, particularly where data from responses is processed, parsed, or returned. Also, potential response errors that could trigger exceptions or logging.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests sent from the class methods (sources) to the server, with response data flowing back into the application logic for processing or return values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard library and third-party libraries appropriately. No obfuscated or malicious code structures identified. Error handling is conventional, and no unsafe eval or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a client wrapper to communicate with a remote API, performing GET and POST requests with data passed through method parameters. It handles responses with standard response checks and logs errors when applicable. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code uses standard security practices, such as response validation and proper error handling. The only minor consideration is the reliance on external HTTP client behavior, but this is typical for such wrappers and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations in a conventional manner, with no suspicious activity detected.",
