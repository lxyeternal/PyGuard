{
  "purpose": "The code defines a client class for interacting with a remote system's runtime events, attribute states, and I/O mappings via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and POST requests to various endpoints, especially in methods like get_runtime_event, post_startup_event, post_attribute_state, get_attribute_state, get_system_io_maps_definition, and get_io_maps.",
  "sinks": "Responses from HTTP requests, especially response.json() and response.text, which are processed and returned or logged. Also, response.raise_for_status() potentially raises exceptions based on response status.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources via HTTP responses into the code through response.json() or response.text, then into method returns or logs. User or external data influences request parameters, especially in methods accepting system_name, attribute_name, etc.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard library functions and external libraries as intended. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. Exception handling is minimal but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP client wrapper around a system's REST API endpoints, with methods for retrieving and posting data. It uses an external HTTP client and logging. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. The use of response.json() and response.raise_for_status() are standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any unsafe or insecure operations beyond typical HTTP communication. All data flows seem intended for legitimate operational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward client interface for interacting with system runtime events and attribute states via HTTP. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The implementation is standard and appears secure. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
