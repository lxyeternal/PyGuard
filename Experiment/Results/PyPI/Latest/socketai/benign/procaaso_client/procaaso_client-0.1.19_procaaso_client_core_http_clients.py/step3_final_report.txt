{
  "purpose": "Provides HTTP client classes for synchronous and asynchronous HTTP requests with basic error handling and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as base_url, url, json, params; response objects from httpx methods.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, exception messages containing response.text.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (base_url, url, json, params) are used in HTTP requests; responses are checked for status code; on failure, response.text is included in exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of response.text in exception messages could leak sensitive data; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard HTTP client wrappers with proper error handling, resource cleanup, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The inclusion of response.text in exceptions is a security consideration but not malicious. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's benign nature and minor security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The primary security concern is potential leakage of response content in exception messages, which should be addressed in production but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent.",
