  "purpose": "Provides synchronous and asynchronous HTTP client wrappers for making requests with error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for URL paths, JSON payloads, and query parameters in 'post' and 'get' methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'response.text' in error messages, which could potentially expose sensitive response data in exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data (json, params, url) -> HTTP request -> response -> error handling with exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception messages that include response.text could leak sensitive server data in logs or error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code creates HTTP clients that perform network requests with basic error handling. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present. Error messages include response text, which might expose sensitive information if server responses contain secrets or tokens. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The code relies on 'httpx' library for HTTP communication, which is standard and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the implementation appears straightforward and legitimate, with a minor concern about exposing response content in exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard HTTP client wrapper without malicious intent. The primary security concern is the exposure of response content in exception messages, which could leak sensitive information if server responses contain secrets. No malicious or suspicious behavior was detected.",
