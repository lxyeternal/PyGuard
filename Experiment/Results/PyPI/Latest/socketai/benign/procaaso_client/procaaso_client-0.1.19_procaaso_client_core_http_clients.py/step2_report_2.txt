  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is standard, with proper error handling, resource cleanup, and no signs of malicious behavior. It assigns a high confidence (0.9), malware (0), obfuscated (0), and low security risk (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. The only minor concern could be that error messages include response.text, which might leak sensitive info, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforwardness of the code, standard use of 'httpx', and no malicious intent. Confidence is 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical HTTP client wrapper. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score remains 0. consistent with the previous assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that error messages include response.text, which could leak sensitive data, but no malicious code or backdoors are detected. Malware score 0, risk 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:** The inclusion of response.text in exception messages is a security concern (potential info leak), but it does not imply malicious activity. The overall code is still a benign HTTP client wrapper.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score should stay at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The risk score could be slightly higher due to potential info leakage, but since the report assigns 0.3, that seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no suspicious patterns or malicious activity. Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no obfuscation or backdoors. It performs typical HTTP request handling.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0, consistent with the others.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code, no malicious intent, and no obfuscation. Malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is a standard HTTP client wrapper.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. No evidence of malicious activity or code.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1 to 0.3). The only concern is the inclusion of response.text in exception messages (Report 3), which is a minor info leak risk but not malicious.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the minor info leak concern, a score around **0.2** is reasonable, which aligns with the reports.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- The potential for response text leakage is a security concern but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Estimated Security Risk Score:** **0.2**\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is benign, with only a minor concern about exception message content. No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
