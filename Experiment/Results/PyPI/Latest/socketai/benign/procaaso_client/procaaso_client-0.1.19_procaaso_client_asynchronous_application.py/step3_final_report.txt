{
  "purpose": "An asyncio-based application class managing startup, runtime task execution, and shutdown procedures, interacting with a client object and ensuring resource cleanup.",
  "sources": "Attributes such as self.startup_task, self.shutdown_task, and self.tasks; the client object and its http_client attribute.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; resource cleanup involves closing the HTTP client if present.",
  "flows": "Startup tasks execute, then tasks in self.tasks are run sequentially in a loop until stop_event is set; finally, shutdown tasks and resource cleanup occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asyncio application managing lifecycle events and task execution. It properly closes the HTTP client during shutdown, with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws. The structure is typical for such frameworks, and no external data leaks or malicious patterns are present. The code relies on attributes like self.startup_task, self.shutdown_task, and self.tasks being initialized correctly, but this is outside the scope of the snippet. The control flow and resource management are appropriate, and no anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis. Overall, it poses a very low security risk and does not indicate any supply chain security issues.",
