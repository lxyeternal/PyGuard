{
  "purpose": "The code defines an asynchronous client class for interacting with a remote system's runtime events, attribute states, and IO maps via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP request responses, input parameters (e.g., attribute values, system names, attribute names).",
  "sinks": "Response JSON parsing, logger.error calls, response.raise_for_status(), and returning data to caller.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses are fetched via the AsyncHttpClient, checked, parsed, and then used to update internal state or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code uses standard library features. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a wrapper around an HTTP client, performing data exchange with a remote API. It uses asynchronous calls, handles responses with status checks, and serializes/deserializes JSON data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code uses standard logging and exception handling appropriately. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are evident. The input and output flow are predictable and directly related to the API endpoints, with no hidden or malicious operations identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical HTTP request handling and data serialization with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
