  "purpose": "A Python async API client wrapper for system events and attribute states, facilitating communication with a remote server.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and POST responses, response JSON data, method parameters providing data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data used internally, error logs potentially exposing response text, method return values.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses are parsed into JSON, data is assigned to class attributes or returned, logs record errors, parameters are used in request construction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Logging error responses could leak info but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async API client class with methods for retrieving and posting system events and attribute states. It performs standard response validation, JSON parsing, and error handling. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation is present. The use of response.json() without additional validation is typical for such clients. Logging errors could potentially leak sensitive info but is common. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed. The code relies on external HTTP client and server trustworthiness. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
