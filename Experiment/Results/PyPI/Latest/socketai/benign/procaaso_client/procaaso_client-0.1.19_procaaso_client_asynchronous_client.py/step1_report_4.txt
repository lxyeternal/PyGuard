{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous client class for interacting with a system via HTTP requests, managing system events, attributes, and I/O maps.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET and POST requests to endpoints such as /runtimeEvent, /attributeStates, /ioMaps/system, and /ioMaps; reading response data; accessing class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Response handling and logging, particularly error logging and response parsing; potential for untrusted response data being processed.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses (sources) are checked and parsed; response data is used to update internal state or returned as method outputs. Error responses trigger logging and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No use of obfuscated or misleading code structures. No dynamic code execution or external command invocation. Logging and error handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods for system event handling, attribute management, and IO map retrieval, all via asynchronous HTTP requests. The code performs response status checks and logs errors but does not contain any code that interacts with external untrusted sources beyond API endpoints. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. All data flows are typical for API client implementations. There are no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage, and the code structure is straightforward and standard for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations such as sending and receiving data via HTTP and includes basic error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
