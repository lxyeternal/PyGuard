  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, purely structural framework defining interfaces for HTTP and application components. No signs of supply chain sabotage, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor concern regarding logging sensitive response data does not elevate overall risk significantly. The current low scores are appropriate and justified."
