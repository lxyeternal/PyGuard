  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely abstract class definitions, with no executable logic, data handling, or network requests.\n- The code relies on external modules like 'procaaso_log' and 'pydantic', but no evidence of malicious use is provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The logging of response text could theoretically leak sensitive info, but in this context, it is a standard error logging practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only abstract class definitions, with no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Data leaks:** Logging `response.text` could potentially leak sensitive data if responses contain confidential info, but this is a standard practice in error handling, not necessarily malicious.\n- **External dependencies:** Usage of 'procaaso_log' and 'pydantic' does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation:** All reports agree on this.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **No actual code execution or data flow:** The reports correctly note the absence of executable logic, which reduces risk.\n- **Security implications of logging:** While the logs could leak sensitive info, this is a common concern but not necessarily malicious. The report appropriately notes this as a potential sink but does not overstate risk.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk, which seems reasonable.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. Since the code is purely abstract and no executable or malicious logic is present, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The potential data leak via logging is a standard concern but does not elevate overall risk significantly unless actual sensitive data is being processed, which is not evident here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (low, due to potential info leak in logs, but standard practice)\n\n**Additional note:** The overall confidence is high (around 0.9), given the consistent analysis across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard set of abstract classes for an application framework.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scoring aligns well with the code content and analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
