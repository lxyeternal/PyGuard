  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for HTTP communication, harness client interactions, and application workflow management within a framework.",
  "sources": "External modules 'procaaso_log' for logging, 'pydantic' for data models, and standard Python modules for type annotations and abstract classes.",
  "sinks": "Logging response text in '_check_response', which could potentially leak sensitive information if responses contain confidential data.",
  "flows": "Response object passed to '_check_response' from network request handlers (not present here), with response.text being logged upon non-200 status codes.",
  "anomalies": "Logging response text without filtering could leak sensitive data; however, this is a common debugging practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract class definitions, method signatures, and minimal error handling. No executable logic, network requests, or data processing are present. The use of logging is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The potential for data leakage via logs is a minor concern but not indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. Overall, the code is a benign, structural framework with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, purely structural framework defining interfaces for HTTP and application components. No signs of supply chain sabotage, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor concern regarding logging sensitive response data does not elevate overall risk significantly. The current low scores are appropriate and justified.",
