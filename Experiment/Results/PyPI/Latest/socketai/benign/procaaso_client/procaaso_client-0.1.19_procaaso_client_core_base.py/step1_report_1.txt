{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for HTTP clients, harness clients, and applications, providing a framework for implementing specific behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'abc', 'typing', 'procaaso_log', 'pydantic'. The only data input is in method parameters, not from external sources directly.",
  "sinks": "Logging errors with response.text could potentially leak sensitive info if response contains confidential data. No other sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs to abstract methods, with no clear data leaks or malicious data flows. No code execution or external connections are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code strictly defines abstract classes and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract base classes for HTTP interactions and application logic, relying on external implementations. No executable code, user input handling, or network operations are present. The use of logging is minimal and does not contain suspicious details. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious language features. No data leakage or malware indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a non-malicious, structural framework for defining clients and applications. It contains no executable logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. It is likely safe with a low malware and security risk score.",
