{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for executing a package as a module, likely invoking a command-line interface (CLI).",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the '.cli' module, which is called if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data exfiltration in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could potentially flow from command-line inputs into the 'main' function in 'cli', but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python entry point that imports and invokes a main function from a local module. It lacks any complex logic, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. As it is a simple script, it does not present any malware or security risks by itself. The main concern would be the behavior within the 'cli' module, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a typical entry point for a CLI-based package with no embedded threats.",
