  "flows": "Executing 'main()' when the script is run directly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and standard for entry points",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a local 'cli' module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There are no suspicious operations, hardcoded secrets, or external network communications. The structure is typical for Python command-line interface scripts. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
