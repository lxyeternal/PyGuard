{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for executing the package as a module, invoking the main function from the cli module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call could potentially execute code defined elsewhere; no specific sink present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the flow is straightforward invocation of main().",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports main() from a local cli module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. The structure is typical for command-line interfaces, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The code does not contain any data handling, network operations, or other potentially malicious activities. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent, and the code appears to be a standard entry point for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard entry point script with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply delegates execution to the cli module's main() function.",
