  "purpose": "Main entry point for running the package as a module",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from the local 'cli' module",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'main()' function when the script is executed directly",
  "flows": "Execution flow from script start to calling 'main()' in the 'cli' module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'main' function from a local 'cli' module and executes it if the script is run directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity suggests it's a standard pattern for Python CLI tools. Without inspecting 'cli.py', no malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied, but this code snippet alone shows no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical entry point for a Python CLI package with no evident malicious intent or security issues based on this snippet alone.",
