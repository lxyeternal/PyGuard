  "purpose": "Minimal Python CLI entry point that delegates execution to cli.main()",
  "sources": "Import of main from local cli module",

  "flows": "from .cli import main -> if __name__ == '__main__': main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation; no embedded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point. It imports main from a local module and executes it if run directly. No network calls, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The behavior depends on cli.main(), which is outside this snippet. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with high confidence. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in this minimal code. The scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero; the slight variation in security risk scores (some at 0, one at 0.1) is unjustified given the code alone. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible based on this snippet. The scores are consistent with the analysis; further review of cli.main() is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
