  "purpose": "Import package metadata variables (__version__, __versiondate__, __license__) from a local module for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .version module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import of metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import of static variables from a local module, serving purely informational purposes. There are no data flows, user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any security vulnerabilities. The only external concern could be if the .version module is malicious, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is safe and standard for package metadata inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement for package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
