  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement for version and license metadata from a local module (.version).\n   - No untrusted data, user input, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata inclusion.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious behaviors present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only imports static metadata variables.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and do not contain errors.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no dynamic or external data handling, the risk is minimal.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for package metadata.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**My Final Estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a simple, safe import of version and license metadata. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring reflects that. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
