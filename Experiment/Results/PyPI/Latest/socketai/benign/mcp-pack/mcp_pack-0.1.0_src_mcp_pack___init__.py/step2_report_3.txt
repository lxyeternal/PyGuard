  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports describe a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .version import __version__, __versiondate__, __license__\n   ```\n   The original code confirms this. There are no additional operations, dynamic code, or external data handling. The code is purely for importing package metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports agree on this point.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and safe. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n5. **Risk Score Justification:**  \n   Since the code is a straightforward import of metadata with no external inputs, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard package metadata import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All indicators point to a benign, safe, and straightforward implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
