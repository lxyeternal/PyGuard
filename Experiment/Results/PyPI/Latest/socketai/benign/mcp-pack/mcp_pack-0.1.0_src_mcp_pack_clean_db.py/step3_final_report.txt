  "purpose": "A utility for deleting all or specific collections from a Qdrant database.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for URL and collection name; loads environment variables via dotenv (not used for secrets).",
  "sinks": "Calls QdrantClient methods to delete collections; exception handling prints errors.",
  "flows": "Input args -> QdrantClient.delete_collection or get_collections -> deletion process -> output messages.",
  "anomalies": "dotenv loaded but not used; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; destructive delete operations are inherent to utility purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It performs deletion operations with proper exception handling. No secrets are hardcoded; dotenv is loaded but unused. The primary risk is operational (data deletion), which is expected. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to destructive operations but justified by utility purpose. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, purpose-specific utility for managing Qdrant collections. It contains no malware or malicious intent. The operational risks are inherent to its function but do not constitute security threats. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
