  "purpose": "Define and expose version and license information for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version, date, and license variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares metadata variables (__version__, __versiondate__, __license__) and an __all__ list. The version date is set to a future date (2025-04-27), which may be unusual but not malicious. There are no code execution, data input/output, or security-sensitive operations. The code is simple and standard for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static metadata declarations with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a normal metadata module for a Python package.",
