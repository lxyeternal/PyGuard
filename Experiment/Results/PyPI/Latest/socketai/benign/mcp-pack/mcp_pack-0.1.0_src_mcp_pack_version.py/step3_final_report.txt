  "purpose": "Define package metadata variables (__version__, __versiondate__, __license__) for distribution info.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals to variables; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assignments only, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future date '2025-04-27' assigned to __versiondate__, which is atypical but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable declarations for package metadata with no dynamic code, external inputs, or executable logic. The only anomaly is the future date, which could be a typo or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1 or 0). The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The future date does not impact security assessment but is noted as unusual.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward package metadata declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only anomaly is the future date, which does not pose a security threat. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
