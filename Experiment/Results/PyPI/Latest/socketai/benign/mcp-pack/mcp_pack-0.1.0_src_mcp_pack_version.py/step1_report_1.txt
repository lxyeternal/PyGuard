  "purpose": "Define and expose version and license information for the package",
  "sources": "The module itself defines string variables for version, date, and license; no external input sources present",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points where untrusted data is used or leaked",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static string values",
  "anomalies": "The version date is set to '2025-04-27', which is a future date, potentially suspicious but not malicious; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no dynamic code, user input, or external data handling. The future date in '__versiondate__' is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent. No hidden or obfuscated code, no external calls, and no suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the future date, which may be a typo or intentional but does not pose security concerns.",
