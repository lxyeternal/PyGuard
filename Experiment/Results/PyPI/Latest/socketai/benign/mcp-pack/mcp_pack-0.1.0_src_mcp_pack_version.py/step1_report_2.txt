  "purpose": "Define and expose package metadata such as version, release date, and license information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version, date, and license strings to global variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; no dynamic data or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata definition with hardcoded strings.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of exported identifiers and assigns static strings to metadata variables. The version date appears to be set to a future date ('2025-04-27'), which might be a typo or intentionally future-dated, but this is not inherently malicious. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains hardcoded versioning information, which is common practice in Python packages.",
