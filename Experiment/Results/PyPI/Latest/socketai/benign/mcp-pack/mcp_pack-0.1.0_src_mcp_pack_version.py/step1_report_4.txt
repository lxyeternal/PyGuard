  "purpose": "Define and expose version and license information for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string values to __version__, __versiondate__, and __license__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of variable definitions and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a list of public API variables (__all__) and assigns static string values to __version__, __versiondate__, and __license__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward metadata module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for package versioning and licensing information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
