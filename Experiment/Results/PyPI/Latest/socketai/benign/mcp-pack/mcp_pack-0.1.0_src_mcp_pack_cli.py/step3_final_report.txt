  "purpose": "CLI utility for creating and cleaning documentation databases related to GitHub repositories.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY), command-line arguments, URL processing.",
  "sinks": "External API calls (create_db, clean_db modules), environment variables used for tokens.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or CLI args -> usage in database processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; URL prefix '@' handling is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool managing database creation and cleanup, securely handling API tokens via environment variables or arguments. It performs URL processing and interacts with external modules for database operations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are standard, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious injections. The security considerations are typical for such tools, with tokens managed securely and no evident vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. It handles sensitive data responsibly and performs its intended functions without malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a score of 0.2, primarily due to handling secrets via environment variables and user input, which is standard practice.",
