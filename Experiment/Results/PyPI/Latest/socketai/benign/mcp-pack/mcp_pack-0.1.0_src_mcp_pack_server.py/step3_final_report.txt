  "purpose": "A server providing semantic search tools for module documentation, source code, and usage examples, facilitating AI agent access to relevant information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, external libraries (QdrantClient, SentenceTransformer, FastMCP), network queries to Qdrant database.",
  "sinks": "Querying external vector database, returning formatted text results; no data exfiltration or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "User query input -> encoding via SentenceTransformer -> querying Qdrant vector database -> retrieving payloads -> formatting and returning results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a semantic search server using standard open-source libraries, with no malicious routines or vulnerabilities. It reads configuration from environment variables, performs vector similarity searches, and returns formatted results. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. External dependencies are typical for such applications, and data flows are straightforward. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external service reliance, which is common and manageable. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero; the low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured semantic search server with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.",
