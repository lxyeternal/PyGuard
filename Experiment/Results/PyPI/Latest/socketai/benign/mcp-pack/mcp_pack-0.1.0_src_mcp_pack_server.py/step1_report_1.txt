{
  "purpose": "The code defines a server for semantic search over module documentation, source code, and usage examples, facilitating AI agent interactions with module information.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'MODULE_NAME', initializes server parameters, and uses external libraries for AI and database operations.",
  "sinks": "Uses external libraries such as QdrantClient, SentenceTransformer, and FastMCP to perform searches and serve tools; no direct data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'MODULE_NAME' -> initializes ModuleQueryServer -> registers tools that query Qdrant database -> returns search results; no untrusted data flows from external sources outside parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of environment variable for module name is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed. No network connections are hardcoded; Qdrant URL is configurable.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server with tools for semantic search over documentation, source code, and examples, using standard open-source libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The database interactions are via standard APIs, and no sensitive data handling or exfiltration routines are present. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The logic is consistent with intended functionality for a module documentation helper.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a semantic search server for module documentation and examples, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
