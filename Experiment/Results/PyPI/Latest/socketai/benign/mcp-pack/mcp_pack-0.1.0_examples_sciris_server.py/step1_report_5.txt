{
  "purpose": "Set up and run a server to provide semantic search capabilities for the 'sciris' module documentation and code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL', imported 'os' module, user-specified module 'mcp_pack.server.ModuleQueryServer'",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get() retrieves environment data; sciris_server.register_tools() and sciris_server.run() invoke methods that could potentially handle external data or commands",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' flows into the ModuleQueryServer initialization; server methods manage incoming requests and data processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code largely functions as a server setup without embedded malicious behavior; no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a server for semantic search of the 'sciris' module documentation, sourcing the URL from an environment variable. It imports the necessary module, creates a server instance with configurable parameters, registers tools, and runs the server with standard input/output transport. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of environment variables is standard, and no untrusted data is directly processed in a harmful way. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a server setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a benign server setup for module documentation retrieval. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks within this code snippet.",
