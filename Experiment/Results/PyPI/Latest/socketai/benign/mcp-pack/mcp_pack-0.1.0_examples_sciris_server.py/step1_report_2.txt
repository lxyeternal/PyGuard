{
  "purpose": "Set up and run a semantic search server for the 'sciris' module documentation and source code.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get to retrieve environment variable 'QDRANT_URL'; importing 'ModuleQueryServer' from 'mcp_pack.server'; server instantiation and method calls.",
  "sinks": "os.environ.get could lead to using a default URL; no data sinks or external connections beyond environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' influences server configuration; server registration and run commands execute without external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation detected; standard server setup with environment variable fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, initializes it with a module name and server name, and uses an environment variable for URL configuration, defaulting to localhost. It then registers tools and starts the server. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious network activity. The server's purpose is documentation search for the 'sciris' module, which appears benign. Overall, the code performs a typical setup without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward server setup for documentation retrieval, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It uses environment variables safely with defaults and performs typical initialization and execution steps.",
