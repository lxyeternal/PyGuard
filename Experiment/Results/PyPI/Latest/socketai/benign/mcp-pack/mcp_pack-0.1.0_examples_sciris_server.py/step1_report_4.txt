  "purpose": "Set up and run a semantic search server for the 'sciris' Python module documentation and source code information.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL', module imports, and server configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' used for URL configuration; server run method potentially exposes a service.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' flows into server configuration; server run method starts listening for input/output via 'stdio'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of environment variables is standard. The code appears to configure and run a documentation server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server class, initializes it with a module name and configuration, and runs the server, printing a startup message. The environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' is used with a default value, which is typical for configurable endpoints. The server's registration and run commands seem straightforward. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose is educational/documentation support for 'sciris'.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server setup for documentation retrieval related to the 'sciris' module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It leverages environment variables appropriately. Overall, it is a safe, purpose-specific server script.",
