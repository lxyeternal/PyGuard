{
  "purpose": "Set up a semantic search server for the 'sciris' module documentation and code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' with default, import of 'os' and 'ModuleQueryServer', server initialization, registration, and startup commands.",
  "sinks": "Server start command with 'transport=\"stdio\"', environment variable retrieval.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' is fetched and used in server creation; server registers tools and runs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server initialization script, importing standard modules, using environment variables safely with defaults, and starting a local server for module documentation queries. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The environment variable usage is standard practice, and the server's purpose is benign. All signals indicate a secure, benign setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1). The overall evaluation confirms the code's safety.",
