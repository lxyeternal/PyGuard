  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** No suspicious code, standard server setup, no obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.95 (claimed as 0, but a high score is justified if considering potential risks, though the code is benign).  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, as the code is benign.\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with mention of environment variable usage, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the standard pattern, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly elevated but acceptable given minimal configuration).  \n- **Recommendation:** Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup, safe use of environment variables, no obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar observations, straightforward setup, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Consistent with others; safe, standard server setup.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid; no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n- **Recommendation:** Set securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. **My estimate: 0.0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. **My estimate: 0.0**  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, the risk is minimal. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.1) are acceptable due to environment variable usage, but overall, I would assign **0.0 or 0.1**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward server setup script, importing standard modules, configuring a server instance with environment variables, and starting it.  \n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.  \n- The environment variable usage is standard practice, with defaults, and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.  \n- The server's purpose is documentation and semantic search, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0.0**           | No malicious code or behavior detected.                        |\n| Obfuscated       | **0.0**           | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.               |\n| Security Risk    | **0.0 - 0.1**     | Minimal risk; environment variable usage is standard and safe. |\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.  \n- The reports are consistent with the code, and no changes are necessary.",
