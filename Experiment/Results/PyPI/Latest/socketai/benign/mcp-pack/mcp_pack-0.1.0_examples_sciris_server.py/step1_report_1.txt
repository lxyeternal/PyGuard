  "purpose": "Set up and run a semantic search server for the 'sciris' Python module to provide documentation, source code, and examples.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' via os.environ.get, imported 'os' module, imported 'ModuleQueryServer' from 'mcp_pack.server', server configuration parameters, server start command.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'QDRANT_URL' could influence network connection, 'print' outputs status message, server's 'run' method starts the server process.",
  "flows": "Environment variable QDRANT_URL -> passed to ModuleQueryServer; server configuration and registration -> server run command -> server starts listening for queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; usage of environment variables is standard; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns; the server setup appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a server for querying module 'sciris' documentation. It retrieves the QDRANT_URL from environment variables, which is typical for configurable network endpoints. The server is registered and started in a standard manner, with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs. The code does not perform any untrusted input handling, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. It is a conventional server setup script for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a semantic search server related to the 'sciris' module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, purpose-driven script with no suspicious activity.",
