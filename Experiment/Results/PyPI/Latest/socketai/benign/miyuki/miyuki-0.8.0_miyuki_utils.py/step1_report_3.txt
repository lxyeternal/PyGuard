{
  "purpose": "Provides thread-safe counting, progress display, interval splitting, playlist line retrieval, closest number finding, and directory cleanup functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout, local variables, input parameters, environment (os.path, os.listdir), and text data in functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.stdout; deletes directories with shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "Progress bar updates read count; delete_all_subfolders reads directory contents and deletes subfolders.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected; functions perform standard utility tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code includes threading synchronization mechanisms and utility functions with no evident malicious intent. No external data or untrusted input sources are directly exploited for harmful actions. The directory deletion function could be misused if called with critical paths, but on its own, it appears as a standard cleanup utility. The progress bar updates and interval calculations are benign. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of utility functions for threading, progress display, interval computation, playlist line processing, and directory cleanup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
