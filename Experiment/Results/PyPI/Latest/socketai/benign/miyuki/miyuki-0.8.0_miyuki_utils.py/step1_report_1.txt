{
  "purpose": "Provide thread-safe counter operations, display progress, split integers into intervals, find the last non-empty line in a text, find the closest number in a list, and delete subfolders within a directory.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.stdout, input parameters (max_value, text, arr, folder_path), os.path.exists, os.listdir, os.path.isdir, and shutil.rmtree.",
  "sinks": "Writing progress bar output to sys.stdout, deleting directories with shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (max_value, text, arr, folder_path) influence progress display and directory deletion. Data flows from input parameters to functions and, in the case of delete_all_subfolders, potentially modifies the filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Functions perform standard utility tasks; no suspicious network activity, data leakage, or code injection observed. The code is straightforward and typical for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions: a thread-safe counter, progress display, integer splitting, text line analysis, closest number finder, and directory deletion. All functions perform standard operations with no indication of malicious intent. There are no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. The directory deletion function is potentially dangerous if misused but is not malicious by itself. No external data is read from untrusted sources other than standard function parameters. No signs of malware, backdoors, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for threading, progress display, list manipulation, text processing, and filesystem management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any harmful actions.",
