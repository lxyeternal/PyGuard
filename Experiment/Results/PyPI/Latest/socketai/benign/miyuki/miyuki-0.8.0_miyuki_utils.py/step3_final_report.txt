{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for thread-safe counting, progress display, integer interval splitting, last non-empty line extraction, closest number search, and directory cleanup, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Standard input parameters such as max_value, file_counter, text strings, integer lists, and folder paths; filesystem operations for directory listing and removal.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate on inputs and filesystem without data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions to produce outputs like progress bars, intervals, or directory deletions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The delete_all_subfolders function could delete critical data if misused, but this is a utility function, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions with standard library usage. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The directory deletion function is potentially dangerous if misused but is not inherently malicious. The progress bar and thread-safe counter are typical for multi-threaded applications. The integer splitting and text analysis functions are standard. No external data flows or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, and free of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is potential misuse of the directory deletion function, which warrants a low security risk score but does not indicate malicious intent.",
