{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for thread-safe counting, progress display, interval splitting, text line analysis, closest number finding, and folder deletion.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as integer inputs, text strings, lists, and folder paths.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to stdout for progress display, and folder contents are deleted via shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident from source inputs to sinks; functions operate on local variables and parameters without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code performs standard utility functions. No obfuscation or misleading variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple utility functions: a thread-safe counter for progress tracking, a function to display progress bar, interval splitting, extracting last non-empty line from text, finding the closest number in a list, and deleting subfolders. All functions operate using standard libraries and do not handle untrusted data in dangerous ways. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation features. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be intended for standard application support, such as progress indication and file system cleanup. No malware or security threats detected.",
