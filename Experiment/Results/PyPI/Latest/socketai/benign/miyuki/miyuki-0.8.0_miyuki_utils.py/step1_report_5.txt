  "purpose": "Utility functions for threading, progress display, interval splitting, text processing, closest number search, and directory cleanup.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'text' parameter in find_last_non_empty_line, 'arr' in find_closest, and 'folder_path' in delete_all_subfolders.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks include sys.stdout.write for progress display, file system operations such as os.path.exists, os.listdir, shutil.rmtree for directory deletion.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to processing functions, and filesystem operations perform delete actions based on provided paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Functions perform standard utility tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides threading-safe counters, progress bar display, interval splitting, text line processing, closest value finding, and directory deletion. No data exfiltration, network activity, or suspicious logic is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. The directory deletion function includes a safety check to ensure the path exists, and it only removes subfolders, not files directly. The overall structure and function names suggest utility rather than malicious intent. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs threading-safe counters, UI progress, data processing, and safe directory cleanup without suspicious activity.",
