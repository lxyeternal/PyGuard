{
  "purpose": "Provides thread-safe counter operations, progress display, interval splitting, text processing, array analysis, and directory deletion utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard input (sys.stdout), environment (os.path.exists), filesystem (os.listdir, os.path.join), and in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout (sys.stdout.write), interacts with filesystem (shutil.rmtree, os.path.exists, os.listdir), and uses threading.Lock for synchronization.",
  "flows": "Uses thread-safe increment in display_progress_bar to update progress; reads and processes text data in find_last_non_empty_line; analyzes arrays with find_closest; deletes directories in delete_all_subfolders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns. Functions perform standard utility operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements common utility functions: a thread-safe counter, a progress bar display, interval splitting, text line processing, array proximity search, and directory deletion. It utilizes threading locks for concurrency safety, filesystem interactions, and standard Python libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modification. The functions appear purpose-driven and align with typical utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing utility functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
