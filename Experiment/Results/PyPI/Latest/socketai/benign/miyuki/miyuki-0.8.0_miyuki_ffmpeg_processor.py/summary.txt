  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate media processing tasks without malicious intent. However, the absence of input validation for filenames introduces a potential security risk if inputs are controlled by an attacker. The assigned scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a moderate risk score around 0.3. To improve security, input validation should be implemented to mitigate injection risks."
