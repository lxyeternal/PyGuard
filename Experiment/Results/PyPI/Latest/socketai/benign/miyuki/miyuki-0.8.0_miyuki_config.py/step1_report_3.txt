  "purpose": "Define constants and regex patterns for web scraping and media processing related to downloading and managing video content.",
  "sources": "Constants such as file paths, URL prefixes, regex patterns, and headers used for web requests and parsing.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily defines static values and patterns, with no immediate data flow or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; the code does not process or manipulate untrusted input, only declares constants and regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly arbitrary 'MAGIC_NUMBER', which could be benign or a placeholder; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares configuration constants, regex patterns for parsing HTML and scripts, and some static values. No input handling, network communication, or data processing is shown. Patterns for matching video URLs, titles, and obfuscated script eval code are present but standard in web scraping contexts. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected based solely on these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration module for a web scraping and media downloading script. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it perform any data processing or network operations. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
