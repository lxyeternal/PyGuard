  "purpose": "Define constants and regex patterns for web scraping, video processing, and data handling related to a media collection project.",
  "sources": "Constants such as file paths, URLs, regex patterns, and headers are hardcoded; these serve as configuration rather than data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data are present. The code does not show data being sent over networks, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; this snippet only defines variables and regex patterns without actual data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a magic number (114514) and patterns suggest possible obfuscation or intentional concealment. Regex for eval-based pattern matching hints at deobfuscation or code extraction activities.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets constants, regex patterns, and configurations. The presence of regex matching eval-function code and obfuscated patterns indicates preparation for analyzing or extracting obfuscated scripts. No execution of dynamic code, network communication, or system manipulation is visible. Hardcoded URLs and regex patterns could be used in web scraping or analysis but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be part of a media scraping or processing tool, with some signs of dealing with obfuscated JavaScript code. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are directly observable within this snippet. Its design seems intended for web data extraction rather than exploitation.",
