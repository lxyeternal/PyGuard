      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate media processing tasks without malicious intent. However, the absence of input validation for filenames introduces a potential security risk if inputs are controlled by an attacker. The assigned scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a moderate risk score around 0.3. To improve security, input validation should be implemented to mitigate injection risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration for web scraping/media processing with regex patterns that may handle obfuscated scripts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with slight adjustments in obfuscation suspicion justified by regex patterns. Overall, the code appears safe and the supply chain integrity is intact."
