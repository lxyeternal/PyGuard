{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, file operations, and possibly environment variables (if used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could leak data or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, files, or system calls).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures identified. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard data processing functions without any external library anomalies. No signs of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The absence of suspicious patterns or obfuscation suggests low risk. However, without knowing the full context or dependencies, this assessment cannot be absolute.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of utility scripts. Nonetheless, due to limited context, a moderate confidence level is maintained.",
