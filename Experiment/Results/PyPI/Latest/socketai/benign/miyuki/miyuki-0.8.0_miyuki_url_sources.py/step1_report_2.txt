  "purpose": "The code provides various classes for extracting URLs from different sources such as playlists, single URLs, search results, login-protected pages, and files, primarily for use in a media or streaming context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from URLs via HTTP requests using cloudscraper, cookies, and local files. Specific sources include provided playlist URLs, individual URLs, search pages, login responses, and file contents.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include fetching URLs via HTTP requests, parsing HTML with regex, and reading from local files. These can lead to code injection if input data is maliciously crafted, or remote data leakage through network requests.",
  "flows": "Input URLs or files serve as sources; regex patterns identify links and pagination; HTTP requests fetch HTML content; regex extracts URLs; URLs are transformed and returned. Data flows from input sources through network fetches and regex parsing to final URL lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of cloudscraper to handle Cloudflare challenges is standard for bypassing protections but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses cloudscraper for HTTP requests with error handling for Cloudflare challenges, which is common for scraping protected sites. URL extraction relies on regex patterns defined externally, with some handling for pagination and link resolution. The login function handles cookies after a login POST request. No code performs actions outside URL extraction or network requests, nor does it handle sensitive data in insecure ways. The only potential concern is the use of regex for HTML parsing, which might be brittle but not malicious. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware signatures. Overall, the code appears focused on URL harvesting with standard techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a URL extraction module using standard web scraping practices with cloudscraper. It manages login sessions, search results, and playlist parsing without evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. Risks are limited to potential misbehavior if regex patterns are maliciously crafted externally, but that is outside this code's scope.",
