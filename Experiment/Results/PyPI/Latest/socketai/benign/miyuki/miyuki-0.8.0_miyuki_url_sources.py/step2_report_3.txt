  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** URL fetching/parsing with cloudscraper, regex extraction, logging.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or obfuscation; logs sensitive info (response snippets, cookies), which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 (due to potential info leakage)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard URL scraper with some risky logging practices. No malware or backdoors. The security risk is primarily from info leakage if logs are exposed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar URL extraction with cloudscraper, regex, login, search.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation; uses regex for HTML parsing, which is brittle but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (possible info leakage via logs)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Standard scraping code, no signs of malware. The main concern is log exposure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** URL extraction from multiple sources, with cloudscraper, regex, login.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation; uses regex for HTML parsing, which could be fragile but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to above, legitimate URL scraper with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** URL harvesting for media content, using cloudscraper, regex, login.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation; logs sensitive info but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Standard web scraping code, no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—various URL sources, cloudscraper, regex, login.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation; standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with others, legitimate URL scraper.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code performs URL fetching, regex parsing, and session management in a typical manner.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (around 0.2-0.3) due to logging sensitive info, but this is a best practice issue, not malicious.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware or malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — potential info leakage through logs, but not a serious security threat.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard web scraper module tailored for media URL extraction, with proper error handling and session management. Its design aligns with typical scraping tools, and no malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is legitimate, with no signs of supply chain or malware issues. The main concern is the exposure of sensitive data via logs, which can be mitigated by adjusting logging practices. Overall, it is safe and well-structured application code.",
