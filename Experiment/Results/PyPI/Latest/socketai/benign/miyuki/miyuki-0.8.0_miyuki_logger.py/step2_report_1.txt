  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard logging setup in Python.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity is involved.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code is consistent across reports and follows best practices for logging configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code as provided correctly sets up a logger with two handlers, both using a formatter, with no evident bugs or security flaws.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risks:** Since the code only configures logging, with no external data or sensitive information handled, the security risk is minimal.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the code's benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- The code is a typical logging setup, often used for debugging or monitoring.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature and assign low scores, which is justified.\n- No changes needed in scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, secure logging setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores reflect this accurately.",
