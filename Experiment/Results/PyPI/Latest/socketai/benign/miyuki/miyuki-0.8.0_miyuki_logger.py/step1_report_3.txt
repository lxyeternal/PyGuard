  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration with a custom logger, handlers, and formatter for debugging and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration and creation of logger, handlers, and formatter objects.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to a file ('miyuki.log') and stdout (console). No untrusted data sources or sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Logger configuration flows into handlers, which then output logs to file and console, but no untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard logging setup with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger named 'miyuki-logger', sets its level to DEBUG, and adds two handlers: a FileHandler writing to 'miyuki.log' and a StreamHandler for stdout. Both handlers are set to DEBUG level and share a common formatter. All steps are typical for a logging setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data flow. No inputs or external data are read or written beyond logging. No sensitive data handling or network activity occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup for debugging and monitoring purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
