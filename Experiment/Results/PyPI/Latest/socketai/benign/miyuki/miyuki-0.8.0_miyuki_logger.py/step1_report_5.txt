  "purpose": "Set up a logging system with both file and console handlers for debugging and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration for logger, handlers, and formatter; no untrusted data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to 'miyuki.log' and stdout; no untrusted data or external systems affected.",
  "flows": "Code initializes logger, configures handlers, sets format, and adds handlers to logger; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected; standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logger with two handlers: a file handler writing to 'miyuki.log' and a stream handler outputting to stdout. Both handlers are set to DEBUG level, and a consistent formatter is applied. No user input or untrusted data is processed; the code simply configures logging behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for setting up logging in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely configures logging output without handling untrusted input or external data.",
