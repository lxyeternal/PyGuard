  "purpose": "Set up a Python logger named 'miyuki-logger' with file and console handlers, both using a formatter for timestamp, log level, and message.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration code, including logger creation, handler setup, and formatter assignment.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to 'miyuki.log' file and stdout stream.",
  "flows": "Logger receives log messages -> handlers process messages -> formatted output written to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward logging setup with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging configuration in Python. It creates a logger, adds a file handler with UTF-8 encoding, and a stream handler for stdout, both with a common formatter. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code follows best practices for logging setup and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's functionality.",
