  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration with a specific logger, handlers, and formatter.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (via sys.stdout) and initializing logger components.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to 'miyuki.log' file and standard output (console).",
  "flows": "Logging messages generated during program execution are directed to both the file and console handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger named 'miyuki-logger' with DEBUG level, attaches a file handler writing to 'miyuki.log' with UTF-8 encoding, and a stream handler outputting to stdout. Both handlers use the same formatter for timestamp, log level, and message. All components are standard Python logging practices. No input validation, external data handling, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging setup without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical configuration for debugging or informational logging in an application.",
