{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for a Python application with both file and console output.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings, modules (logging, sys), and the file 'miyuki.log'. No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to 'miyuki.log' and stdout; no external network, database, or sensitive data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static code initializes logger, handlers, and formatter; logs are outputted to file and console with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger named 'miyuki-logger' with DEBUG level, attaching a file handler to 'miyuki.log' and a stream handler for stdout, both with consistent formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. It is a typical logging configuration without external or untrusted data input or suspicious output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves the purpose of logging application messages.",
