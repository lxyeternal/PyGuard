{
  "purpose": "Set up a logger named 'miyuki-logger' with both file and console handlers for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration and initialization data for logging setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard logging configuration without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger object with DEBUG level, adds a FileHandler for 'miyuki.log' with UTF-8 encoding, and a StreamHandler for stdout, both set at DEBUG level. It defines a formatter with a specific format and date format, then attaches these handlers to the logger. All operations follow standard logging practices without any dynamic execution, external data input, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for logging in a Python application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
