{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to export specific agent classes from a module for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from external modules within the 'crm.agents.tabular' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no output or data transmission occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations; merely imports and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network communication. The imported modules are part of a structured package, likely for reinforcement learning agents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activities. The code's simplicity and standard structure suggest it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module that re-exports classes from other modules. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a benign, standard component of a larger codebase.",
