{
  "purpose": "The code exports references to two agent classes related to reinforcement learning algorithms, likely for use in a larger CRM-related project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'crm.agents.tabular.cql' and 'crm.agents.tabular.ql' modules, which are standard Python import mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "The __all__ declaration, which controls exported symbols for modules importing this code.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in classes; __all__ exposes specific class names for external use. No data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of class references. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes from a local package and defines the exported symbols. There are no dynamic executions, no external data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. The import paths suggest these are reinforcement learning agent implementations related to tabular Q-learning algorithms. No evidence of malicious behavior or security issues is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple module re-exporting two classes for external use, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
