{
  "purpose": "The code imports two agent classes related to reinforcement learning from a CRM package and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from external modules within the crm.agents.tabular package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code only defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; the imports are static and from trusted internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports two classes from internal modules and sets the __all__ attribute for module exports. There are no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated logic. The import statements are standard and reference package modules likely used for reinforcement learning agents. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to re-export specific classes for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
