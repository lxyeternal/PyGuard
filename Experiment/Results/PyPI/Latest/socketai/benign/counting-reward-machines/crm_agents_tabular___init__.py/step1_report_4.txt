  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for Q-learning related agents, likely part of a reinforcement learning framework or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from crm.agents.tabular.cql and crm.agents.tabular.ql modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, which is standard for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as an interface for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting solely as a module interface with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
