  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code itself.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code contains only import statements for two classes from internal modules within the 'crm.agents.tabular' package.\n- It declares `__all__` to specify which classes are exported.\n- There are no data processing, input/output, network communication, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Any mistakes in reasoning?** No. All reports correctly identify that this is a simple module re-export pattern with no security concerns.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Potential Over- or Under-Scoring:\n- The highest confidence score is 1, which is appropriate. The only report with 0.9 confidence suggests a very low likelihood of risk, which aligns with the evidence.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malicious claims:** None of the reports suggest any malicious intent; all are consistent.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- **Risks higher than 0.5:** None, justified by the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a standard module re-export pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
