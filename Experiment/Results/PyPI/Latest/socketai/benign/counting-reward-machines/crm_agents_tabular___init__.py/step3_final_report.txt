  "purpose": "Module that re-exports specific agent classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules within 'crm.agents.tabular'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of classes -> declaration in __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports two classes from internal modules and declares them in __all__ for export. There are no data flows, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The structure is simple and standard for a module re-export. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are appropriate.",
