{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing specific components from internal packages and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports from internal modules 'crm.automaton.compiler' and 'crm.automaton.machine'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a minimal, standard module declaration with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific functions/classes and declares __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The simplicity and clarity of the code align with standard practices for module exports. The lack of external data flows or network activity further reduces risk. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions solely as a module interface, and the scores should reflect this with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk score (preferably 0).",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
