{
  "purpose": "This code defines an API module that exports specific functions and classes for use elsewhere, primarily related to automaton compilation and machine models in the 'crm' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'crm.automaton.compiler' and 'crm.automaton.machine', which are package modules. No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code, are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The import statements and export list are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific components from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no functions, data handling, or control flow that could indicate malicious intent. The imports are from a package likely related to automaton models, and nothing in this snippet suggests malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module declaration that exports selected classes/functions from internal modules. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this code fragment.",
