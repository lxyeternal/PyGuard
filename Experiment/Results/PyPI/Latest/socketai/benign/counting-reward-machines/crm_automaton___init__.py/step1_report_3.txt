  "purpose": "Exporting functions and classes from crm.automaton modules for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements from crm.automaton.compiler and crm.automaton.machine modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, no network, no file writing, no environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; simply importing and exporting references.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from two modules within 'crm.automaton' and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It does not process any input, perform any operations, or execute any potentially risky code. No malicious behavior or security issues are present based solely on these import statements and the __all__ declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports specific components from internal modules, which is a common practice in Python packaging.",
