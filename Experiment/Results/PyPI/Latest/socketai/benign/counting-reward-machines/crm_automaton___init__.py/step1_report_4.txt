{
  "purpose": "This code exports specific components from the crm.automaton package, likely for use in other modules or projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from crm.automaton.compiler and crm.automaton.machine modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling mechanisms are present; the code only imports and exports functions and classes.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from a package named crm.automaton and explicitly exports them via __all__. This is a typical module setup for a library or package, indicating that these components are intended for external use. There is no evidence of code execution, data manipulation, or network activity. The simplicity and clarity of this code suggest it is standard boilerplate for package export purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module export definition with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially harmful actions. The risk of malicious activity or security concern is very low.",
