{
  "purpose": "The code exports two imported functions/classes for use in other modules, likely related to automaton processing within a CRM system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'crm.automaton.compiler' and 'crm.automaton.machine'. These are package internal modules that load functions/classes for automaton compilation and machine logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code segment; there are no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as this code only imports and re-exports components without any data processing or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. It merely re-exports imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules and defines an __all__ variable for explicit exports. It does not perform any data manipulation, input/output, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious activity is observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export module that does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical boilerplate for organizing module exports.",
