  "purpose": "This code exposes specific functions and classes related to automaton compilation and machine modeling, likely for a larger CRM or automaton processing system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from crm.automaton.compiler and crm.automaton.machine modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Importing modules which may internally contain source-to-sink flows, but none are visible here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two components and declares an export list (__all__). No runtime behavior, input handling, or data processing occurs here. The imports seem standard and depend on external modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a module interface definition. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident from this limited snippet.",
