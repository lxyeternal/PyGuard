  "conclusion": "The code pattern introduces a high security risk due to unsafe use of exec() with external input, making it vulnerable to code injection attacks. There is no evidence of embedded malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk score should be approximately 0.8, reflecting the potential for exploitation. Malware score remains at 0, as no malicious payloads are present. To mitigate this, refactoring to avoid exec() or implementing strict input sanitization is recommended."
