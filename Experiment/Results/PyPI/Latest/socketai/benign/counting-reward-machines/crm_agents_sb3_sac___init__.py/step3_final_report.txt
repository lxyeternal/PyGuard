  "purpose": "Module that imports the CounterfactualSAC class from a nested package and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from crm.agents.sb3.sac.csac",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Importing class from package; no data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward import/export statement",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement that brings in a class from a nested package and exposes it through __all__. There are no data flows, input/output operations, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The package path suggests it relates to reinforcement learning agents, which is typical and benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign module with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The import statement and package path do not indicate any security issues. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence, are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
