  "sources": "Import statement importing CounterfactualSAC from a submodule within a package.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, I/O, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement with no additional code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named CounterfactualSAC from a specific module path within a package structure. It then declares __all__ to specify this class for export. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or other logic. The import path suggests a structured package, but no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports a class from an internal package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.",
