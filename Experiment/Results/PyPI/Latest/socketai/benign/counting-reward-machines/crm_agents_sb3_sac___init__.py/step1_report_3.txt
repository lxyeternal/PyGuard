{
  "purpose": "The code exports the CounterfactualSAC class from a specific module, likely for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class from 'crm.agents.sb3.sac.csac'. No data input or external sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output; the code only imports and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; it only contains an import and an export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present; the import path appears legitimate and typical for modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a nested module within the 'crm' package and then defines the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, malicious commands, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules intended for package exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a larger, well-structured project. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks present in this snippet.",
