  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a module by exporting the CounterfactualSAC class from a submodule.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from crm.agents.sb3.sac.csac import CounterfactualSAC'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observed beyond the import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard Python import and export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named CounterfactualSAC from a nested module within the package hierarchy and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It appears to be part of a package's API definition, likely for a reinforcement learning component. No external data processing or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration exporting a class; it shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign package component.",
