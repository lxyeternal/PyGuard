{
  "purpose": "The code extends a multi-environment vectorized class to dispatch method calls to multiple environments in parallel.",
  "sources": "Imports from stable_baselines3 library; self._get_target_remotes method; method arguments: method_name, method_args, indices.",
  "sinks": "remote.send and remote.recv calls, which communicate with environment processes.",
  "flows": "Dispatches method calls to environment remotes via send, then collects results via recv.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The use of send/recv for inter-process communication is standard in parallel environment management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that allows dispatching arbitrary methods to environment instances in parallel. It retrieves target environment remotes, sends method invocation messages, and receives the results. The communication appears standard for multiprocessing environments. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or backdoors are present. There are no indications of obfuscated or malicious code. All functions and methods are consistent with environment dispatching logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension for parallel environment management in reinforcement learning workflows. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security issues based on the provided fragment.",
