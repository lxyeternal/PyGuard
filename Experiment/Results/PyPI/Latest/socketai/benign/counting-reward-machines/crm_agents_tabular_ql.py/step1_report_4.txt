  "purpose": "Implementation of a Q-Learning reinforcement learning agent for interacting with a gym environment.",
  "sources": "Reads environment states (obs), rewards, and actions; uses random number generation for exploration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Environment observations and rewards are processed to update the Q-table; random values influence action selection.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard libraries without suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials or obscure code patterns. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard Q-Learning algorithm with typical features: epsilon-greedy policy, Q-table updates, environment interactions, progress tracking with tqdm. No suspicious network activity, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. Use of random functions is standard for exploration. No external or hidden data leaks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a reinforcement learning agent without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of training an agent in a gym environment. No security risks or malware detected.",
