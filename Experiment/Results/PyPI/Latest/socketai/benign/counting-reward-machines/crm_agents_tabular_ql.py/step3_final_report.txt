  "purpose": "A standard implementation of a Q-Learning agent interacting with a gym environment for reinforcement learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Environment reset and step functions providing observations, rewards, and termination signals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, network calls, or external data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Observation data from environment to agent decision logic; reward signals influencing Q-table updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of a Q-Learning agent using common libraries. It performs environment interactions, updates a Q-table based on observed rewards, and employs epsilon-greedy exploration. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code uses standard patterns and functions typical of RL implementations, with no network activity or data leaks. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a Q-Learning agent with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given its standard nature.",
