  "purpose": "The code exports the DispatchSubprocVecEnv class from a submodule within the crm.agents.sb3.vec package, likely for use in reinforcement learning environment management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'crm.agents.sb3.vec.subproc' indicating the source is a module within a package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into the module's namespace; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior. It simply re-exports a class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a submodule and explicitly declares it for export. No input, data processing, or output occurs. The import is from a submodule within the package, which is typical for organized Python code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports a class from a subpackage, with no malicious or security concerns evident in this snippet.",
