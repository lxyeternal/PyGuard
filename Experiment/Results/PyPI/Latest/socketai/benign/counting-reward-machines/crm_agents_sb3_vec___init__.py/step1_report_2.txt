  "anomalies": "Minimal code with standard import and export; no anomalies or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an external package and declares it for export. There is no evidence of data handling, input processing, or any malicious activity. The import path suggests a module related to multiprocessing or environment management, but by itself, it is standard. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign code snippet that imports and exports a class for external use. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
