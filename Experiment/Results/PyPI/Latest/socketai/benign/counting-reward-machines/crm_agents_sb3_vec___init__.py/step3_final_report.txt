  "purpose": "Module re-export of DispatchSubprocVecEnv class from a submodule, likely for external use in reinforcement learning environments.",
  "sources": "Import statement from crm.agents.sb3.vec.subproc; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import from submodule to module namespace, then export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export statement, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence levels. No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious actions are present. The code functions as a module re-export, typical in Python projects, and does not involve any dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No further action or concern is warranted.",
