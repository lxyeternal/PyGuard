{
  "purpose": "Export the DispatchSubprocVecEnv class from the module for external use, likely to run subprocess-based vectorized environments in a reinforcement learning or simulation context.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing DispatchSubprocVecEnv from a specific submodule within crm.agents.sb3.vec.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling, no network operations, no file operations, and no data leakage points.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs an import and defines an __all__ list, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual patterns. The import path is specific but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a nested module within the crm.agents.sb3.vec package and makes it available for external import via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The module appears to be a typical part of a larger codebase, likely related to reinforcement learning environments or agent simulation. No sensitive information or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger project, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
