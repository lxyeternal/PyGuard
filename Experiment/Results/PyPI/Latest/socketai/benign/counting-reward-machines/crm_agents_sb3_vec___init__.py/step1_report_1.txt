  "purpose": "The code appears to export a class or function called DispatchSubprocVecEnv from a module within a package structure, likely for reinforcement learning or agent environment management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports a specific class from a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code only exports a symbol.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs in this snippet; it is a module export statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns.",
