{
  "purpose": "The code reads and displays the content of a specified file from a 'data' directory relative to the current script location.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.dirname, __file__, open() reading from a file",
  "sinks": "Reading file content from the filesystem and printing it to output",
  "flows": "Constructs file path -> checks existence -> opens file -> reads content -> prints and returns content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic behavior, straightforward file read operation",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path based on the script's directory and a filename argument, then reads and displays its content. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The code performs standard file I/O without any suspicious operations. It does not include network access, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The only potential concern could be reading unintended files if the filename input is untrusted, which could lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, but this is a common concern rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple file read and display operation with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. Its main concern is potential directory traversal if filename input is not sanitized, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
