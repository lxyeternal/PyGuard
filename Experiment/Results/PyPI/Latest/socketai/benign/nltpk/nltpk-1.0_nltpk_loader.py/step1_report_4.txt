{
  "purpose": "The code reads and displays the contents of a specified file from a 'data' directory relative to the script location.",
  "sources": "The filename parameter provided to show_code, used in os.path.join and os.path.exists, and in open() to read the file content.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reads file content; the print() function outputs content to the console. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input: filename parameter -> Constructs file path -> Checks existence -> Reads file content -> Prints and returns content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward file reading and printing without hidden or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code safely constructs a file path based on the provided filename, checks for existence, and reads its content. It outputs the content directly to the console. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code relies on the filename parameter but does not use it in a dangerous way such as executing code or writing data. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for simple file display functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, safe file read and display operation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
