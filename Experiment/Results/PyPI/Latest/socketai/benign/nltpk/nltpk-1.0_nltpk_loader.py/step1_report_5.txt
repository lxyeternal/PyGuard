{
  "purpose": "The function 'show_code' reads and displays the contents of a specified file located in a 'data' directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a filename provided as a function argument and constructs a file path using 'os.path.join' and 'os.path.dirname(__file__)'.",
  "sinks": "The code opens and reads the content of the specified file, which could potentially contain malicious code or data if the file is malicious or untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'filename' is combined with a base directory path; if the file exists, its content is read and printed. No further data flows or processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard file existence check and reading operation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present. No dynamic code execution or network activity is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path from the given filename within a 'data' directory, checks for its existence, and reads its content if present. It then prints the content and returns it. The use of '__file__' ensures the path is relative to the script location, preventing arbitrary file access outside the intended directory. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The code operates within safe bounds for reading local files and displaying their contents. It does not perform any network activity, execute code, or leak data externally.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, safe file read operation from a designated directory, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a straightforward utility function for displaying file contents.",
