{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and display the contents of a specified file from a 'data' directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameter 'filename' provided to the show_code function, and from the file system (os.path and open).",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the open() function that reads the file content, which is then printed and returned.",
  "flows": "The filename parameter influences the constructed file path; if the file exists, its content is read and displayed/returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform input validation or sanitization on 'filename', which could lead to directory traversal (e.g., passing '../' sequences). No other suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path based on the provided filename, relative to a 'data' directory. It checks for existence before opening the file to prevent errors. The main risk is if 'filename' is manipulated to include directory traversal patterns, which could allow access to unintended files outside the 'data' directory. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The function solely reads and displays file content based on input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file reader with potential risk of directory traversal if user input is not sanitized. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware in the code itself, but input validation should be added for security.",
