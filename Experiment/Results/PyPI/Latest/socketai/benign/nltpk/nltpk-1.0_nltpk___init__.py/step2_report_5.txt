  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: `from .loader import show_code`.\n- There are no signs of data flow, external input, or output.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscation. Therefore, **no issues are present** beyond the benign import.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign and minimal.\n- No report claims or implies malicious intent or vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code snippet.\n- The analysis correctly notes that the code alone does not execute any malicious behavior.\n\n**No flaws or mistakes** are evident in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is correct; there's no malware activity.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- Since the code is just an import statement with no data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads, **risk scores should remain at 0**.\n- No evidence suggests a security threat, so assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n\n- All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No report overstates potential vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**           |\n| Security Risk   | **0**           |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or data flow.  \n- The risk is negligible; thus, all scores should be zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign; no issues are present.\n- Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
