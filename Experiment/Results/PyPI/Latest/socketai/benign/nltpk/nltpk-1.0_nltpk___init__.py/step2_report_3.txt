  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a single line: `from .loader import show_code`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, common in Python modules.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as an import statement.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent from this snippet.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Malware:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All are 0, appropriate for such a simple import.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is purely an import statement, the risk scores should remain low.\n- The malware score is correctly zero; there's no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and typical for Python modules.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
