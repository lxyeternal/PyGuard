  "flows": "No data flows are present; only a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This snippet imports a function from a local module named 'loader'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no malicious activity indicated. The simplicity suggests standard module import behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs observed. Given the limited context, no malicious or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project.",
