  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a simple import statement from a local module `loader`.\n- None of the reports identify any data flow, external input, output, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.\n- All reports assign a high confidence level (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does** contain only a single import statement: `from .loader import show_code`.\n- No external data, network activity, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears benign and typical for Python modules.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- No significant flaws are evident. The reasoning is consistent and well-supported.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n- Since the code is purely an import with no further logic, the risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n- The malware scores are also correctly zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Potential risks:\n- Given the code snippet alone, there is no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a simple import statement with no malicious or security concerns. No changes are needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
