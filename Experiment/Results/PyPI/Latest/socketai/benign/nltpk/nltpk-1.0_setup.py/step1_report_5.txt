{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the Python package 'nltpk'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data through the 'setup()' function, specifically from 'find_packages()' and static strings for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup configuration is static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is a standard setup script with typical usage of setuptools. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools', then calls 'setup()' with static arguments defining package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data processing is involved. The code is a minimal, standard setup configuration for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware; it solely defines package metadata.",
