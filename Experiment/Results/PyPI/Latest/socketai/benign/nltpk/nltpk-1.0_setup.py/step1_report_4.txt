  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'nltpk'.",
  "sources": "Read package data via find_packages() and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package discovery (find_packages()) into setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder author name 'Your Name' which indicates incomplete or generic metadata; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory, and configures basic package metadata. No code injection, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The author field is a placeholder, but this is not malicious. The code is a standard setup script with minimal configuration, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical package configuration file.",
