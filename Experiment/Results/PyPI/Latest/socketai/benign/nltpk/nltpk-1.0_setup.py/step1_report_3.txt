  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and setup parameters for the 'nltpk' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' and uses 'find_packages()' to identify package modules; all source data is from the setup script itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only sets package metadata without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and uses 'find_packages()' to gather package modules for setup. It defines package metadata such as name, version, description, and author. The script is straightforward and typical for Python packaging. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code, security issues, or anomalies. It appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
