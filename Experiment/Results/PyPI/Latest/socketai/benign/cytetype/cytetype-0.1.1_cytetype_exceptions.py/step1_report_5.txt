  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the CyteType package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; only exception class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no input operations, data processing, or network activities. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages that define custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a part of the package's error handling system and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
