  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the CyteType package to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows between sources and sinks; classes are purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. All classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or external data access. The purpose is to facilitate error handling within the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code injections. The code is simple and standard for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
