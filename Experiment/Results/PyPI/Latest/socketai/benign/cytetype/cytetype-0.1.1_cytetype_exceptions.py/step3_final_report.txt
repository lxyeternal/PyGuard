  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the CyteType package to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance with no unusual constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is a standard pattern for error handling in Python packages, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
