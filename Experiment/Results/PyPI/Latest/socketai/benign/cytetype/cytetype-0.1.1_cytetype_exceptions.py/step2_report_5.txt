  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is solely defining custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network calls. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in Python packages.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:  \n   No report identifies any suspicious constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is clean, simple, and typical.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. There is no evidence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Issues in Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No report overstates the risk or assigns unwarranted scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   Based on the code and the reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
