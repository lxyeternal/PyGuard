  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code appears to be a standard pattern for defining error classes in a Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code structure is correct and idiomatic.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis, as the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - All claims are based on static code analysis, which is appropriate here.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are necessary; the code is transparent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Estimation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
