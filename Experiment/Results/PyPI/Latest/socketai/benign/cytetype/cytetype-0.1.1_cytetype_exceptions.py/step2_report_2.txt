  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no external inputs, data processing, or any operational code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely for error handling within the package.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent are evident.\n   - The code is standard practice in Python packages to define custom exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overstate or understate the risk.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are unfounded.\n   - The reasoning is sound: defining custom exceptions is a standard, safe practice.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), which is justified.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Based on the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n   - No further investigation is warranted for this code snippet.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.",
