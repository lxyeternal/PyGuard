  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network calls.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The code is standard practice for error handling in Python packages.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Flaws**:\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - No external data or sensitive information is involved.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, as expected.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   \n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely class definitions with no external interactions.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - There is no need to adjust the scores; they accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No evidence suggests any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and should stand as is.",
