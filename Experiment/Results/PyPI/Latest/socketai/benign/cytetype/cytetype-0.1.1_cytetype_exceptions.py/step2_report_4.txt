  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review & Evidence of Malicious Activity**:\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external data inputs, no data processing, no network calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code aligns with standard Python practices for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes, the risk is negligible.\n   - No reason to assign a higher malware or security risk score.\n   - The code's purpose is to facilitate error handling, which is standard and safe.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & My Estimation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n   \n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
