  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the CyteType package to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points or data leak points are present; the code solely defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs in this code as it only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no operations that could be malicious. It appears to be standard practice for a Python package to define custom exceptions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling within the CyteType package. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
