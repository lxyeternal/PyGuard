  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the CyteType package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only declares classes and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no data input points, no processing logic, no external calls, or environmental variable usage. The structure is standard for defining error hierarchies, and no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard set of custom exception classes for the package's error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
