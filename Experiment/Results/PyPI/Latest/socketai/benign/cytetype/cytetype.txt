The scores are consistent with the analysis; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report reflects cautious handling of untrusted input but does not indicate actual vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks. The hardcoded API URL, while a minor concern in some contexts, is typical for configuration files and does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and minimal security risk. No adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client for external cell type annotation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the slight security risk score reflects reliance on external API security but is overall minimal."
