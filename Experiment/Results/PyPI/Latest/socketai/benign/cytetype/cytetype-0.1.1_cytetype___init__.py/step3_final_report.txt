  "purpose": "This code exports the function 'annotate_anndata' from a local module, serving as a simple module interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "Import from .main to __all__ export",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. It is a minimal, standard Python module pattern. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
