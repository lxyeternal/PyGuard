  "purpose": "Configure logging behavior and set default constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables or external input is not present; the code defines static constants and configures a logger.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout; no untrusted data sink identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static constants are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'loguru' and configures it to output logs to stdout with a specific format. It also defines three constants for API URL, poll interval, and timeout, all assigned static values. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data are processed or transmitted. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve straightforward configuration and logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup for logging and configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
