  "purpose": "Configure logging output format and define default configuration constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sources": "None; static constants and import statements",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without dynamic data or user input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logging library, removes default handlers, adds a custom handler with fixed format, and defines three constants with hardcoded values. No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The API URL is a static string pointing to a production-like endpoint, which is common in configuration files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code is standard setup code for logging and configuration, with no security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks. The hardcoded API URL, while a minor concern in some contexts, is typical for configuration files and does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and minimal security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
