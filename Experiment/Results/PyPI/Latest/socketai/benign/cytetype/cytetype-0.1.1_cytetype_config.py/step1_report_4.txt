  "purpose": "Configure logging behavior and define some default constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from sys.stdout for logging output and defines hardcoded string constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sinks": "The logging output is sent to sys.stdout; no untrusted data is processed or outputted. The constants are static and do not act as data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a hardcoded API URL, which could be a concern if intended for a malicious purpose; however, it's common practice for configuration constants.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging via loguru, removing previous handlers and adding a new one that outputs to stdout with a minimal format. It defines constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout, all hardcoded. There are no input sources, no data flow involving external or untrusted data, and no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward logging setup and configuration constants without any malicious intent or security risks. The hardcoded API URL could be considered a security concern if used maliciously, but in standard context, it is typical for configuration.",
