  "purpose": "Configure logging output format and define default configuration constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sources": "Constants DEFAULT_API_URL, DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; logging is only output to stdout with fixed format.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions; constants are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets besides the API URL.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logging library and configures it to output logs to stdout with a specific format. It removes default handlers and adds a new one. It also defines three constants for API URL, poll interval, and timeout. All code appears straightforward and standard for logging setup and configuration. The URL is hardcoded but not necessarily malicious. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic execution is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up logging and defines configuration constants without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
