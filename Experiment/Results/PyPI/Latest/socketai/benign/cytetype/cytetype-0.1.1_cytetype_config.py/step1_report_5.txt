  "purpose": "Configure logging with loguru and define some default constants for API URL, polling interval, and timeout.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string for DEFAULT_API_URL, constants DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, and sys.stdout for logger output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for logging output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The URL appears to be a production endpoint but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports loguru for logging, removes default handlers, and adds a custom handler that outputs to stdout with a minimal format. It also defines three constants: a URL pointing to a remote service, an interval, and a timeout value. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The URL is static and publicly accessible, with no signs of malicious intent. The code is simple and appears to serve configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely handles logging configuration and defines static constants without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
