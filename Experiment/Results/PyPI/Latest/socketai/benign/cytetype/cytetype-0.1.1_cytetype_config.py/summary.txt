  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks. The hardcoded API URL, while a minor concern in some contexts, is typical for configuration files and does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and minimal security risk. No adjustments are necessary."
