  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report reflects cautious handling of untrusted input but does not indicate actual vulnerability."
