  "purpose": "Validation, analysis, and marker gene extraction from anndata objects used in single-cell RNA-seq data processing.",
  "sources": "adata.obs, adata.uns, adata.var, adata.var_names, adata.uns[rank_genes_key]['names']",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data flows or network communication",
  "flows": "Data read from adata object to validation functions, marker extraction, and percentage calculations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard error handling and data processing",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of anndata structure, computes gene expression percentages within clusters, and extracts top marker genes. It uses typical libraries (anndata, numpy, pandas) and handles data types appropriately. No network activity, external data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. Error handling is robust, and the logic aligns with common bioinformatics workflows. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report reflects cautious handling of untrusted input but does not indicate actual vulnerability.",
