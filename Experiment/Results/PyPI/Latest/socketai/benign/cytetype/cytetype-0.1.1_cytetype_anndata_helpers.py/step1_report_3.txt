  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate an AnnData object, calculate expression percentages of genes within clusters, and extract marker genes based on ranking results.",
  "sources": "adata.obs (cell grouping data), adata.X (expression data), adata.uns (ranking results), adata.var (gene metadata)",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if untrusted input influences adata object, but none are explicitly shown here",
  "flows": "Input data from adata sources flow through validation and processing functions; gene expression data flows into calculations and marker extraction",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of logger warning is standard. No unsafe eval, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation and data processing on anndata objects, with no signs of malicious behavior. It checks for proper structure, computes gene expression percentages, and extracts top marker genes based on precomputed rankings. The use of numpy, pandas, and standard Python practices indicates normal data analysis routines. No external network or system commands are invoked, and no secret or sensitive data handling is visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical biological data analysis utility with no malicious intent. It processes data in a safe manner, relying on well-understood libraries and standard data validation steps. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are present.",
