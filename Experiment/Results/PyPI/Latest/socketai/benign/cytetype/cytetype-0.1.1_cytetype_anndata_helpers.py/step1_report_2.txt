{
  "purpose": "The code validates and processes anndata objects for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, specifically for gene ranking and marker extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads from adata.obs, adata.uns, adata.var, adata.X, and adata.var_names.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from adata object properties through validation, computation, and marker extraction functions without external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of the adata object, computes gene expression percentages per cluster, and extracts top marker genes based on previous ranking. Usage of numpy, pandas, and anndata is conventional. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The function logic and data handling are consistent with typical bioinformatics workflows, with appropriate error handling and logging. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and focused on bioinformatics data processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is a standard implementation for single-cell data analysis with no evident security risks.",
