{
  "purpose": "This code submits annotation jobs to an API and polls for the results, handling network requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via 'query' parameter, API URL inputs, response JSON data, and response error messages.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted response data for JSON parsing, raises exceptions, and logs details; no critical sinks for malicious payloads identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'query' input into POST request, response JSON data is parsed and checked, then results are polled via GET request; response data influences flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of detailed logging and error handling is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code securely makes HTTP requests with timeouts, handles exceptions properly, and processes responses cautiously. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Response parsing is standard and safe. No signs of malware, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The code appears to implement a typical API polling pattern with appropriate error handling and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client implementation for submitting and polling annotation jobs. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. The structure and logic are consistent with standard network request handling and do not suggest malicious intent.",
