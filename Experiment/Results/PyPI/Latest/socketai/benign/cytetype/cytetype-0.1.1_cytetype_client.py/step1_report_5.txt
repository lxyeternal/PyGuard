{
  "purpose": "The code submits annotation jobs and polls for results via a web API, likely used for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (query, job_id, api_url), and reads response data from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted response data (JSON content from responses) which could influence flow or cause errors, but does not execute or evaluate it directly for malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided input (query, job_id, api_url) to API endpoints; responses flow back into the code for validation and control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; exception handling appears standard. No signs of data leakage or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API request and polling operations with appropriate error handling. It reads input parameters for API interaction, sends HTTP POST/GET requests, and processes JSON responses. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; responses are validated for expected keys. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present. The code handles errors gracefully, indicating a focus on robustness rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical API client implementation for submitting and polling jobs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data handling. It is a well-structured, standard implementation without malicious intent.",
