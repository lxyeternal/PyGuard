{
  "purpose": "The code handles submitting annotation jobs to an API and polling for results.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user-provided 'query' dict, API responses (JSON responses), and URL endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to injection if 'query' or URL parameters are manipulated and not sanitized, but currently appears safe.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'query' into POST request; response JSON is parsed for 'job_id'. Polling response data is parsed for 'status' and 'result'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code observed. Use of time.sleep() is standard, no hidden commands. No malicious URL or domain indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code securely submits data to an API and polls for results, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of external libraries is standard for such operations. No suspicious data leaks, credential theft, or command execution observed. The code operates in a typical request-response manner with no unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for submitting and retrieving annotation jobs. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It follows best practices with error handling and timeouts, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code.",
