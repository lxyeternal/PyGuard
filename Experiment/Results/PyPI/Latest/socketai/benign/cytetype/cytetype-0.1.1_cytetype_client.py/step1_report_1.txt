{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to submit annotation jobs to a remote API and poll for the results.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: query (dict), api_url (str), job_id (str), poll_interval (int), timeout (int). It also reads from response JSON objects and logs.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON processing, logging, and raising exceptions. No data leaks or untrusted data handling outside response processing.",
  "flows": "Input query data -> POST request to API; response containing job_id -> poll for results via GET request; response containing status/result -> handle accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. Use of logger for debugging, which may reveal internal states if logs are exposed. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code securely performs API interactions with proper error handling, including timeouts and response validation. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive info present. The request and response handling appears standard and safe. Logging is used primarily for debugging and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code is detected, such as network exfiltration, system manipulation, or obfuscated functions. The code manages untrusted data via response validation and exception handling. Overall, the code functions as intended for API job submission and polling without evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured API interaction module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical request-response handling with appropriate error management and no suspicious activity observed.",
