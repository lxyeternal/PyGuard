{
  "purpose": "The code submits annotation jobs to an API and polls for results, facilitating interaction with an external annotation service.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'query' parameter, API URL, and job ID. Reads response data from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to untrusted data if response data influences logic or logging without validation, but no direct sinks for malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' and 'api_url' are sent via HTTP requests; responses are parsed; status is checked; results are returned if successful.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of external 'logger' is standard; no obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions with request/response handling, including error handling for network issues and response validation. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. It correctly handles timeouts and response errors, and no suspicious or obfuscated logic is present. Usage of requests library and response parsing follows best practices, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical API client implementation with proper error handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate use, assuming the external API is trustworthy.",
