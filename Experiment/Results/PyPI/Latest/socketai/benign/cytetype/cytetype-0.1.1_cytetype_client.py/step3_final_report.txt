{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client for submitting annotation jobs to an API and polling for their results, handling network requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'query' parameter in submit_annotation_job and the API responses during submission and polling.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data handling occurs when response JSON is parsed; no direct sinks like data exfiltration or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'query' to the API via POST request; responses are parsed, and based on 'status', the code either continues polling or returns results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard error handling and logging are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with proper error handling, response validation, and logging. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws. It handles untrusted responses cautiously and manages network errors appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure API client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Its security risk is minimal, primarily due to logging practices and response handling, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
