{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to get the size of a video file given its filename, primarily for validation and extraction of video dimensions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'video_filename' received from function argument; calls to PythonValidator.is_string and FileValidator.file_is_video_file for validation.",
  "sinks": "cv2.VideoCapture opens the video file; v.get retrieves video properties. No data is transmitted externally or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input string -> validation functions -> cv2.VideoCapture -> retrieve width and height properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard validation and media property retrieval without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function validates the input as a string and as a video file before opening it with OpenCV's VideoCapture. It then retrieves the video's width and height. Validation steps appear standard and use external, reputable validation libraries. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and focused on its intended purpose without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for extracting video dimensions with appropriate validation. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It appears safe for use, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
