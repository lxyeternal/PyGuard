  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Validates `video_filename` as a string.\n- Checks if the filename points to a valid video file via `FileValidator.file_is_video_file`.\n- Uses OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`) to open the video and retrieve its width and height.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- External validators are used, and the core logic is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code performs standard validation and uses well-known libraries for video processing.\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  No. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only minor concern could be if `FileValidator.file_is_video_file` is unreliable or if `cv2.VideoCapture` is misused, but these are external dependencies, and their trustworthiness is assumed.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | The report correctly notes no malicious activity; risk is minimal, mostly due to reliance on external validators. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Similar reasoning; no malicious activity, just standard validation and media access. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | Straightforward, no suspicious code or behavior. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | Same as above; proper validation, no malicious signs. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | Consistent with other reports; no issues. |\n\n**Note:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Risk scores** are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Malware scores** are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify the absence of obfuscation and malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard utility function with proper validation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The minor risk scores reflect the potential for misuse if external validators are compromised, but this is speculative.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to external dependencies; standard validation)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a straightforward, validated utility for extracting video dimensions.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is present.  \n- The current scores are appropriate; I agree with them.",
