  "purpose": "Extracts the dimensions (width, height) of a given video file after validating its filename and type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'video_filename' validated as string and video file; external validators ensure file validity.",
  "sinks": "cv2.VideoCapture uses the filename to open the video; no untrusted data flows into critical system components beyond this.",
  "flows": "Input 'video_filename' -> validation via PythonValidator and FileValidator -> cv2.VideoCapture -> retrieve width and height.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward validation and property retrieval. External validators are assumed trustworthy.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation on the filename, ensuring it is a string and a valid video file. It then uses OpenCV to open the video and retrieve its dimensions. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The reliance on external validators is typical, and the core logic is simple and safe. The only minor concern is the potential misuse of the filename, but validation mitigates this. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk. Overall, the code is a standard utility with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for obtaining video dimensions with proper validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
