{
  "purpose": "To retrieve the resolution (width and height) of a video file given its filename.",
  "sources": "The input data is the 'video_filename' parameter provided to the 'get_video_size' function, which is validated as a string and checked as a valid video file.",
  "sinks": "The 'cv2.VideoCapture' function accesses the video file specified by 'video_filename' to read its properties. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'video_filename' passes through validation functions, then is used as a parameter to 'cv2.VideoCapture', which reads the file's properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs straightforward validation and uses standard OpenCV functions to retrieve video properties. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code validates that 'video_filename' is a string and a valid video file before opening it with OpenCV. It then retrieves the video dimensions using standard 'cv2.VideoCapture' methods. The process appears typical and secure, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns. No external network calls, no data leakage, and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to get video size, with proper validation steps and standard library usage. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
