{
  "purpose": "To retrieve the dimensions (width and height) of a given video file by validating input and using OpenCV.",
  "sources": "The function reads 'video_filename' parameter, which is validated as a string and as a video file.",
  "sinks": "The code uses 'cv2.VideoCapture' to open the video file and retrieve properties; no untrusted data directly flows into vulnerable sinks.",
  "flows": "Input validation occurs at the start; validated filename flows into 'cv2.VideoCapture', then properties are retrieved without further untrusted data input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs input validation for a filename string and confirms it is a valid video file. It then opens the video with OpenCV and retrieves its dimensions. No sensitive data, network operations, or malicious patterns are present. Use of third-party libraries (OpenCV, custom validators) is standard. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for obtaining video dimensions with proper validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe based on the provided code.",
