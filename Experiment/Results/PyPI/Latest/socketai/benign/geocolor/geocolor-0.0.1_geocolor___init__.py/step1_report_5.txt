  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level package initialization for 'geocolor', defining metadata such as author, email, and version.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident, as the code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal with no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) with no functional or data processing logic. It does not include any inputs, outputs, or behaviors that could be malicious. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be standard package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata for the package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
