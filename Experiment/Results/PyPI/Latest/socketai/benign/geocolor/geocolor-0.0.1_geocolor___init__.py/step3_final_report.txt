  "purpose": "Define package metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) for the geocolor package.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to __author__, __email__, and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, external calls, or dynamic data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code only declares static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module setting static metadata variables. No input handling, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not contain any suspicious constructs, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata declaration with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
