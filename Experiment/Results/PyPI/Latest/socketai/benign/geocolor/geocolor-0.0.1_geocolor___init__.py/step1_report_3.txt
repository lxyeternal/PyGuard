  "purpose": "Declare package metadata for the 'geocolor' Python package.",
  "sources": "Author, email, version variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; metadata assignment is static",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) with static string values. No input handling, no data processing, and no external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The content is typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious or security issues. It does not pose any security risks.",
