{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata for the 'geocolor' package, such as author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "No input sources present; only metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata assignment with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal top-level package descriptor with author, email, and version attributes. There are no code constructs that read external data, execute commands, or handle untrusted input. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The email address appears normal, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical for Python packages and contains no suspicious elements.",
