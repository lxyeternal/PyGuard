  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple function printing a static string. There are no input sources, data flows, or external dependencies. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious constructs, and no data flows that could pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static print statement with no input, no external dependencies, and no suspicious constructs, a security risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly assign 0 to `securityRisk`, `malware`, and `obfuscated`.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on concrete analysis rather than assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a trivial utility function with no security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, and the reports reflect that accurately.",
