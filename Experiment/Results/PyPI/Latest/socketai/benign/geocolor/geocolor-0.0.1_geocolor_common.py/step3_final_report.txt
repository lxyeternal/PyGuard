  "purpose": "A simple utility function that prints 'Hello World!' to the console.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with no external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static execution only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, clear code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'hello_world()' that outputs a static string. It contains no input handling, external dependencies, or data flow. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The analysis confirms the code is a trivial, safe utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
