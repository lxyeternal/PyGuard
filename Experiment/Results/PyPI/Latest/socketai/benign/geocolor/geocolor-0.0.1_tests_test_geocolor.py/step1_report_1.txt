  "purpose": "The code defines a basic unit test structure for the `geocolor` package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for `unittest` and `geocolor` modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up a test scaffold.",
  "anomalies": "The test class and methods are placeholders with no actual test logic; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, but no real tests or data processing occurs. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors. The package import `geocolor` is standard and unremarkable. Overall, the code appears to be a minimal test scaffold with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic test template with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no executable logic beyond test setup, and no anomalies are present.",
