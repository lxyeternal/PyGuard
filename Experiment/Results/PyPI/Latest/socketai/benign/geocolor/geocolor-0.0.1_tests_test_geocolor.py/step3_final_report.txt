  "purpose": "A minimal Python unittest scaffold for the 'geocolor' package, serving as a template for testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`unittest`, `geocolor`), class and method definitions (setUp, tearDown, test method).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external communication, or data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and contains only structural elements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, boilerplate test scaffold with no actual test logic, data processing, or external interactions. It imports standard libraries and defines a test class with placeholder methods. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
