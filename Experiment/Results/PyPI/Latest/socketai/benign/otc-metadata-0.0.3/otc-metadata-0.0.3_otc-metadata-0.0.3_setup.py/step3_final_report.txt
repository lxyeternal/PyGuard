{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, executes a fixed shell command to write a message to a file in /tmp, serving as a proof-of-concept or demonstration.",
  "sources": "The run() method of PostInstallCommand, specifically the os.system() call with a static echo command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a command that writes a message to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "flows": "The source is the call to os.system() in run(), which executes the echo command, resulting in writing to the file in /tmp.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() during setup, executing a fixed echo command; no dynamic input or network activity; the command is benign but unconventional for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a benign, fixed shell command during package installation, writing a message to a file. No malicious payload, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The use of os.system() is generally discouraged but here is used with a static, harmless command. The behavior is consistent with a proof-of-concept or demonstration. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risk of arbitrary code execution during install, but the current command is harmless. Overall, the code is safe but demonstrates a capability that could be misused if modified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign action during installation, with no evidence of malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1-0.2. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
