  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package to execute additional commands post-installation.",
  "sources": "The method run() within the PostInstallCommand class, which is invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a shell command to write to a file in /tmp.",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers PostInstallCommand.run(), which executes os.system().",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system to execute a shell command that writes a specific string to a file in /tmp; no other suspicious activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, writes a message to a temporary file. This operation does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. The use of os.system for a benign echo command appears to be a demonstration or placeholder, rather than malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code's main activity is simply to write a message to a file post-install.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign post-install action that writes a message to a temporary file. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data theft, or harmful behavior. The use of os.system is a minimal security concern given the simplicity of the command. Overall, this code appears safe.",
