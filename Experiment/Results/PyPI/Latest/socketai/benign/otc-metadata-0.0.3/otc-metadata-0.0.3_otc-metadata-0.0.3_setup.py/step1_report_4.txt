{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a system command during installation.",
  "sources": "The system call os.system(\"echo 'Just a demo POC for the seasides 2025 SAST SCA Village' > /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt\") inside the run() method of PostInstallCommand.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a shell command that writes a message to a temporary file, which could be considered a side effect but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method is invoked, executing the system command that writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs a shell command during package installation that writes a specific message to a file. This action is unusual for a setup script and could be used for tracking or testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command PostInstallCommand that overrides the run() method. This method calls os.system to execute a shell command that writes a predefined message to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt. The message appears to be a demo or proof-of-concept statement. No malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors is evident. The action is unconventional for a setup script but not inherently malicious; it may be used for tracking or demonstration purposes. Overall, the code executes a benign shell command with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code runs a harmless echo command during installation, which is unusual but not malicious. It does not contain malware or security risks, though it could be considered suspicious if unexpected in a production environment.",
