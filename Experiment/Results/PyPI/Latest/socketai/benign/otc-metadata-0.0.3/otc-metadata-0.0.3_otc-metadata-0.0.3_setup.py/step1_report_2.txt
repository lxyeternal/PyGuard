  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script with a custom install command that writes a message to a file during installation.",
  "sources": "The os.system call within the run method of the PostInstallCommand class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system command potentially executes arbitrary shell commands, but here it executes a fixed echo command. The file /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt is created or overwritten.",
  "flows": "The run method is invoked during package installation, executing the echo command which writes to a file in /tmp.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute a shell command during installation. The command is fixed and does not incorporate untrusted input, but the behavior could be used maliciously if modified. No sensitive data is handled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, runs an os.system call to write a static message to a temporary file. This behavior is benign and does not perform any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoor creation, or system manipulation. It appears to be a proof-of-concept or demo. The use of os.system is generally discouraged due to security concerns, but here it is used with a hardcoded, non-variable string, minimizing risk. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a harmless echo command during installation, writing a message to a temp file. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a demonstration or placeholder code.",
