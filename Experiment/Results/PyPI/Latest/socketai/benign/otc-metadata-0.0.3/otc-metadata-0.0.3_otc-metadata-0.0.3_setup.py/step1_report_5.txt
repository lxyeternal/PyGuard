  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The custom run method in PostInstallCommand that executes an os.system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call which executes a shell command that writes a message to a temporary file.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the run method executes, invoking os.system, which runs the echo command and writes to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for executing a shell command during installation; writing a message to a temporary file as part of the install process. No credentials or sensitive data are hardcoded beyond a benign message.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command. The custom command overrides the run method to execute a shell command that writes a string to a temporary file. This action is executed during package installation. The message appears to be a benign proof of concept (POC) statement and does not perform any malicious activity like data exfiltration, backdoor creation, or system compromise. The use of os.system is a potential security concern if the command were to include untrusted input, but in this case, the command is static and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It performs a benign action during installation, likely as a demonstration or proof of concept. No security risks or malicious intents are evident based on the provided code.",
