  "purpose": "Registering CLI commands by returning a list of command objects from imported modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'init' and 'sanitize', and the 'click' library.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "The function returns references to command objects from 'init' and 'sanitize' modules, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for CLI command registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'click' and two local modules, then defines a function returning a list of command objects. It does not handle user input, perform dynamic execution, or network operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature. Malware scores are 0, and security risk scores are very low (~0.1), which is appropriate given the simplicity. The high confidence scores are justified. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI command registration pattern with no malicious or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
