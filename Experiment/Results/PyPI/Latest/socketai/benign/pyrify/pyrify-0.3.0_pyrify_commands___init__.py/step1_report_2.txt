  "purpose": "The code defines a function that returns a list of command objects for a CLI application, specifically 'init' and 'sanitize' commands imported from sibling modules.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'click' library and local modules 'init' and 'sanitize'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing command objects; no data sink points involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the function simply returns imported command references.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a command-line interface library and local modules, then constructs and returns a list of command objects. It appears to be part of a CLI tool setup. No input validation, external data processing, or dynamic execution is observed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal patterns for command registration in CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for CLI command registration, and contains no malicious or security-risk indicators.",
