{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a database schema configuration for sanitization purposes using data retrieved from a PostgreSQL database.",
  "sources": "Input source is the db_url parameter provided via command-line options; the driver.tables and driver.columns attributes fetch database schema information.",
  "sinks": "Output is the generated YAML configuration displayed to the user via click.echo; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input (db_url) → driver initialization → fetching schema (tables and columns) → constructing database_structure → output via generate_yaml_config → printing YAML with comments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys. Use of dynamic data is confined to database schema extraction, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (click and yaml) for CLI and YAML output, with a driver module for database interaction. It dynamically constructs a schema configuration based on database schema metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; no data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors detected. The YAML comments serve explanatory purposes only. The code appears safe and straightforward in functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate configuration generator for database sanitization tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The operations are limited to reading database schema metadata and printing a YAML template, which is typical for such utilities.",
