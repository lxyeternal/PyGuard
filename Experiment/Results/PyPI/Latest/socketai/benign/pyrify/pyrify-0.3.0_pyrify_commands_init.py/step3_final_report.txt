  "purpose": "Generate a YAML configuration template based on database schema information retrieved via a provided database URL.",
  "sources": "The database URL input parameter; the pyrify.drivers.PostgresDriver fetching table and column metadata.",
  "sinks": "The output YAML configuration displayed via click.echo, which contains schema details and user instructions.",
  "flows": "Input database URL -> driver retrieves schema data -> generate_yaml_config constructs YAML string -> output to user.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; straightforward schema retrieval and YAML output with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a CLI utility that connects to a database using a user-provided URL, retrieves schema information (tables and columns) via an external driver, and outputs a YAML configuration with default strategies (~) for each column, accompanied by detailed comments. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity beyond initial connection, or handle secrets. The code is simple, relying on standard libraries and an external driver, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The output is static and intended for configuration purposes. The only potential concern is dependency trust in the external driver, but no malicious activity is evident. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for generating database schema-based YAML configuration files. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate; the minimal risk score reflects the low inherent risk of database interaction and configuration generation. No modifications are necessary.",
