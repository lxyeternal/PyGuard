  "conclusion": "The code is designed for data anonymization but employs unsafe SQL query construction practices. While there is no malicious intent or malware, the insecure SQL handling poses a significant security risk if inputs are untrusted. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.7 to reflect the severity of the SQL injection vulnerability."
