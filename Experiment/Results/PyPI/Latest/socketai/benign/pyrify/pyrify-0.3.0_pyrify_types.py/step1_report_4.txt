  "purpose": "Define data structures for table and sanitize configuration settings.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; code only defines data classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data leaks or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data structures are initialized but contain no flow of untrusted data or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of type hints with Union syntax is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, TableConfig and SanitizeConfig, using Python's dataclasses module. These classes serve as configuration holders with default values. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices. No input validation, no external data fetching, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of configuration data structures for table sanitization settings. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
