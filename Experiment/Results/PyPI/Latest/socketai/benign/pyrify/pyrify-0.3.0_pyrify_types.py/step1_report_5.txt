  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for table settings and sanitization options.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions with default values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no execution flow or data processing is performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type hints with 'dict[str, str | dict[str, Any]]' which is syntactically valid in Python 3.10+ but could be considered unconventional or potentially confusing; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses: TableConfig and SanitizeConfig, with fields initialized via default_factory and default values. There are no data inputs, external calls, or data handling mechanisms. The code appears purely declarative for configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of configuration data structures with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not include any operations, input/output, or external interactions that could be exploited.",
