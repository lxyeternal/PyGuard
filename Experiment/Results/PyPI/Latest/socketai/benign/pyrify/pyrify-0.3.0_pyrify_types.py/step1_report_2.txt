  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for table and sanitization settings using dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Module imports and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious logic, or unusual code patterns. Usage of type hints with union types is standard in modern Python.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for defining data classes and type annotations. It declares two dataclasses, TableConfig and SanitizeConfig, with attributes set using default factories and simple default values. There are no external data sources, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of configuration data classes with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
