  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures for table and sanitization settings using Python dataclasses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class definitions with default factories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; purely declarative.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with modern type annotations and default factories.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses, 'TableConfig' and 'SanitizeConfig', used for configuration purposes. It employs standard Python features such as type annotations, default_factory for dicts, and default values. There are no external data reads, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns. The code is static and purely declarative, serving as a schema. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation are present. The type annotation 'dict[str, str | dict[str, Any]]' is valid in Python 3.10+ and does not pose security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration schema with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, assigning appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The analysis confirms the code's benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
