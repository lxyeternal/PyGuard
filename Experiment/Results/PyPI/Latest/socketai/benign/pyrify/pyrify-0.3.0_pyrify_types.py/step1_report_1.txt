  "purpose": "Define data structures for table configuration and sanitization settings using dataclasses.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of dataclass definitions for configuration purposes. It uses standard Python features: dataclasses, type annotations, and default factories. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code appears to be part of a configuration schema setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign configuration data structure definition with no signs of malware or security issues.",
