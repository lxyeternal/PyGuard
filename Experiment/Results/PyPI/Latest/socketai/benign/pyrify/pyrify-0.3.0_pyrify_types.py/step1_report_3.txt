  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for table settings and sanitization options.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only declares data classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two @dataclass definitions: TableConfig and SanitizeConfig, used for configuration purposes. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is involved. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly defines data structures without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward and safe, serving solely as data structure definitions for configuration purposes without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
