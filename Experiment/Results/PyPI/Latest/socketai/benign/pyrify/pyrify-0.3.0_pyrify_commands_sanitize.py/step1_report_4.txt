  "purpose": "Define a command-line interface for sanitizing a database using specified configuration and database URI.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line options: '--db-uri' and '--config' path.",
  "sinks": "utils.get_driver(), utils.load_config(), utils.sanitize_db() functions which potentially handle database connections and data processing.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> utils.get_driver(db_uri) and utils.load_config(config) -> utils.sanitize_db()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, straightforward use of third-party libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path, click, and a utils module. It defines a CLI command 'sanitize' with required options for database URI and config file. The function calls utility methods to load configuration, establish a database driver, and perform sanitization. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network transmission, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to perform a typical database sanitization routine via external utility functions. The functions called could theoretically perform dangerous operations if malicious, but based solely on this code, they seem to be intended for data cleaning.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper that utilizes utility functions for database sanitization. There are no obvious signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior in this code snippet.",
