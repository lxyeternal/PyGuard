  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface to sanitize a database using specified configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line options: 'db-uri' (string) and 'config' (file path).",
  "sinks": "The functions 'utils.get_driver', 'utils.load_config', and 'utils.sanitize_db' are invoked with user-provided data, potentially affecting database operations.",
  "flows": "User provides 'db-uri' and 'config' -> 'utils.get_driver' and 'utils.load_config' process these inputs -> 'utils.sanitize_db' performs sanitization based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior are present. The code primarily calls external utility functions without inline malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses command-line options to accept database URI and configuration file path. It then invokes utility functions to load configuration, establish a database driver, and sanitize the database. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are visible within this snippet. All data flows originate from user input but are handled via function calls that are assumed to be standard utility functions. Without access to the implementation of these utility functions, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for legitimate database sanitization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, intended operation of database sanitization via utility functions with user-supplied parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
