  "purpose": "Defines a CLI command to sanitize a database using provided URI and configuration file.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: db-uri (string), config (file path)",
  "sinks": "utils.get_driver(), utils.load_config(), utils.sanitize_db() functions",
  "flows": "db-uri and config are passed to utils.get_driver() and utils.load_config(), then their outputs are used in utils.sanitize_db()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious variable names, straightforward use of utility functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a CLI command 'sanitize' with options for database URI and configuration file. It then calls utility functions to load configuration, get database driver, and perform sanitization. All function calls seem standard; no suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The functions called are from a utility module; their internal implementations are not shown, but the usage here appears legitimate. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper around utility functions for database sanitization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears safe based on the visible code.",
