  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI wrapper for database sanitization relying on external utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the utility functions, which should be verified. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.1 to reflect the minimal but non-zero potential risk depending on external dependencies."
