  "purpose": "Define a command-line interface for sanitizing a database using provided configuration and database URI.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: db_uri (via command-line argument), config file path (via command-line argument).",
  "sinks": "utils.sanitize_db() and utils.get_driver() potentially process untrusted input, but only if their implementations are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to utility functions which likely handle database connection and configuration loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a CLI command with options for database URI and configuration file, and calls utility functions to perform database sanitization. The code appears straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The security depends on the implementation of 'utils.sanitize_db', 'utils.get_driver', and 'utils.load_config'. The code itself does not contain malicious actions, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for database sanitization, with no immediate indicators of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this fragment. The safety of the operation depends on the utility functions used, which are not shown here.",
