  "purpose": "Provides a command-line utility to sanitize a database using specified configuration and database URI.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line options: --db-uri and --config file path.",
  "sinks": "The utils.load_config and utils.get_driver functions are used to process input data; potentially, utils.sanitize_db could perform database modifications.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs -> utils.get_driver and utils.load_config -> utils.sanitize_db",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Use of command-line options for database URI and config file is typical. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a CLI command 'sanitize' with options for database URI and configuration file path. It calls utility functions to load configuration, establish a database driver, and sanitize the database. No direct handling of sensitive data, user input validation beyond required flags, or insecure practices are apparent. The actual security implications depend on the implementation of the utils functions, which are not provided. The structure appears straightforward and standard for a command-line database utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for database sanitization with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. The actual risk depends on the utility functions' implementation, which is not included. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
