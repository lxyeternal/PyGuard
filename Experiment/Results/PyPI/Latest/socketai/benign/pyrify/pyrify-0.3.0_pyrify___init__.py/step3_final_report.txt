  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving data input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file operations, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via code execution, data processing, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across most reports, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation detected. Report 5 highlights dynamic code execution ('exec'/'eval') with unvalidated inputs, posing a security risk. The malware scores are mostly zero, aligning with the absence of confirmed malicious activity. The security risk score in report 5 is justified due to potential code injection vulnerabilities. Minor obfuscation noted in report 4 is acceptable. Overall, the code shows no signs of sabotage or supply chain compromise, but the dynamic execution warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is generally safe with no confirmed malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, which increases security risk. Adjusting the malware score for report 5 to reflect this elevated risk is recommended. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses.",
