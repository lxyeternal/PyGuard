  "conclusion": "The dependency is generally safe with no confirmed malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, which increases security risk. Adjusting the malware score for report 5 to reflect this elevated risk is recommended. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses."
