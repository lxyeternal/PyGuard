{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package or script intended for general functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function arguments, or external files/read operations within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network calls, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sink points such as network transmission or file storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code were identified. Some dynamic code execution or eval statements, if present, should be checked carefully for malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured with standard imports and functions. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system manipulation was observed. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, with no unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution points that could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The code seems to perform intended utility functions without security anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a benign utility or package code with no evident security threats or sabotage activities.",
