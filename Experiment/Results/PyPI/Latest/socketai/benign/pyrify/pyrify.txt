      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI setup with dynamic command registration. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The main potential risk depends on the implementation of 'get_commands()', which is outside this scope. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The dependency is generally safe with no confirmed malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted inputs, which increases security risk. Adjusting the malware score for report 5 to reflect this elevated risk is recommended. Scores across reports are consistent with their analyses."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is free of malware and obfuscation but presents a moderate security risk due to dynamic SQL construction without sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection if identifiers are untrusted. The risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. To mitigate this, parameterize or sanitize table and column names before use. Overall, the code is safe in intent but should be used with caution regarding input trustworthiness."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is designed for data anonymization but employs unsafe SQL query construction practices. While there is no malicious intent or malware, the insecure SQL handling poses a significant security risk if inputs are untrusted. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score should be adjusted to approximately 0.7 to reflect the severity of the SQL injection vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration schema with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, assigning appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The analysis confirms the code's benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary."

The assigned scores are appropriate; the minimal risk score reflects the low inherent risk of database interaction and configuration generation. No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI wrapper for database sanitization relying on external utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the utility functions, which should be verified. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.1 to reflect the minimal but non-zero potential risk depending on external dependencies."
