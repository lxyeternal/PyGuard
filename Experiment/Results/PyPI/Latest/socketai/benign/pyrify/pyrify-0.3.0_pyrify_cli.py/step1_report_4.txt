{
  "purpose": "Define a CLI tool named Pyrify for database sanitization using the Click library and dynamically register commands.",
  "sources": "get_commands() function from pyrify.commands module, and __name__ == \"__main__\" block for script execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential command functions retrieved from get_commands() could execute, but not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "The main function is called when the script runs, and commands from get_commands() are added to the CLI group.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the click library and a function get_commands from pyrify.commands. It defines a CLI group 'main' with a docstring. It then iterates over commands returned by get_commands() and adds each to the CLI group. The main block executes main() when the script is run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for dynamically registering commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI application setup with dynamic command registration, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
