  "purpose": "Defines a CLI group 'main' and dynamically registers commands from 'get_commands()' for the Pyrify tool.",
  "sources": "Import of 'click' and 'get_commands()' from 'pyrify.commands'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' as the entry point; no data sinks or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports -> CLI group definition -> command registration via 'get_commands()' -> execution if __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard CLI pattern. External 'get_commands()' implementation is unknown, which could be a risk but is outside this code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI setup using 'click', with dynamic command registration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The main concern is the external 'get_commands()' function, which could introduce malicious commands if compromised, but this cannot be assessed here. The code itself appears benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. The high confidence score reflects the straightforward nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security flaws within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI setup with dynamic command registration. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The main potential risk depends on the implementation of 'get_commands()', which is outside this scope. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
