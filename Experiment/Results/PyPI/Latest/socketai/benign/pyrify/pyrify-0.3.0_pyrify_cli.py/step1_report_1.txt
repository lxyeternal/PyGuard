{
  "purpose": "Define a CLI tool named Pyrify for database sanitization and register commands dynamically.",
  "sources": "get_commands() function imported from pyrify.commands, invoked to retrieve command objects",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is written or transmitted untrusted data; no sensitive data handling evident",
  "flows": "get_commands() provides commands that are registered with the main CLI group; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; no indication of obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the click library for CLI creation and a function get_commands for dynamic command registration. The main function defines a CLI group. Commands are registered via a loop over get_commands(). The script executes main() if run directly. The structure is standard for CLI applications and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The get_commands() function's implementation is not shown, so potential risks depend on its internal code, but from this snippet, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI setup for a database sanitization tool with no malicious intent or security risks evident in this fragment.",
