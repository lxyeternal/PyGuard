  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI setup with dynamic command registration. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The main potential risk depends on the implementation of 'get_commands()', which is outside this scope. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."
