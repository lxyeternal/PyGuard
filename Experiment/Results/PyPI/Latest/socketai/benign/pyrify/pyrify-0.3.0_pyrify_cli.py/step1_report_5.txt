{
  "purpose": "Define a CLI tool called Pyrify for database sanitization and register commands dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'click' for command-line interface creation and imports 'get_commands' from 'pyrify.commands' to retrieve command functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly contain data sinks; however, the dynamically registered commands could potentially be sources of malicious behavior if they include untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves command functions via get_commands() and adds them to the main CLI group, which is then executed if the script runs directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code structure appears standard for a CLI tool setup. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a command-line interface using the 'click' library. It defines a main command group and dynamically adds commands retrieved from an external module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or insecure practices. The only potential concern would be the nature of commands returned by 'get_commands', which is outside the scope of this code but could introduce risks if malicious commands are provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for a database sanitization tool, with no evident malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment. The main risk depends on the contents of 'get_commands', which is not shown here.",
