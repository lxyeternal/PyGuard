{
  "purpose": "Defines a CLI tool for database sanitization using the 'click' library and dynamically registers commands retrieved from pyrify.commands.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'click' and a function 'get_commands' from pyrify.commands, which likely provides command objects. It reads no other input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data, user input, or external data processing directly within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing command objects via 'get_commands()' and adding them to the main click group, then executing the CLI entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present. The code dynamically registers commands, which is typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'click' library for command-line interface creation and uses a function 'get_commands' to retrieve command objects. It defines a main command group 'main' with a description. It then registers all commands from 'get_commands' with the main group, allowing modular command addition. The script executes 'main()' if run as the main module, serving as the CLI entry point. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security issues. The code appears standard for a CLI wrapper that dynamically loads commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI setup for a database sanitization tool, with dynamic command registration. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks in this fragment.",
