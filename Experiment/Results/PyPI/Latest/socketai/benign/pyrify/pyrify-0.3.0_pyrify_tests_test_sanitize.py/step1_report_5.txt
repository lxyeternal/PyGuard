{
  "purpose": "The code sets up database connections, creates tables, inserts test data, and performs data sanitization for testing purposes, focusing on preventing sensitive data leaks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for database URIs; retrieves and executes SQL queries; accesses database schema and data.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL commands, including raw SQL text; modifies database contents; potentially exposes sensitive data during tests.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → create_engine → database connection → data insertion → data retrieval → data sanitization → verification.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables for database URIs which could be sensitive if not secured; no hardcoded credentials in code; no obfuscated code; data sanitization process appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes database engines using environment variables, performs schema creation and data insertion, then runs sanitization procedures to mask sensitive data. No suspicious code behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The use of environment variables is common but should be secured. Data sanitization aims to mask sensitive fields, which aligns with good security practices. No evidence of malware, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for database sanitization without any malicious intent. It securely handles data masking and database setup. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present.",
