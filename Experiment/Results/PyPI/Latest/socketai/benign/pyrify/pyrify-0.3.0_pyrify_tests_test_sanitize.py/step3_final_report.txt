{
  "purpose": "The code sets up database connections, creates tables, inserts sample data, and performs sanitization of sensitive fields for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for database URIs, database connection, data insertion points, and sanitization functions.",
  "sinks": "Database query executions, data retrieval after sanitization, and potential data masking outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables to database engine creation, through data insertion, then to sanitization functions that modify sensitive fields, and finally to data retrieval for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; straightforward use of environment variables and standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing setup involving database initialization, data insertion, and sanitization. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of environment variables is typical but should be managed securely in production. The sanitization replaces sensitive data with fake data, which is a common privacy measure. No external network activity or malicious behaviors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on environment variables, which is acceptable in a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The minor security risk relates to environment variable handling, which is standard in testing environments.",
