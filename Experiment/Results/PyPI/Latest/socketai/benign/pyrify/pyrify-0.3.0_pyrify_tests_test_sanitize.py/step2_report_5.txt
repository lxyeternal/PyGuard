  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily setup and testing code involving database connections, schema creation, data insertion, and sanitization.\n- It relies on environment variables for database URIs, which is standard practice but can pose risks if misconfigured.\n- The sanitization replaces sensitive data with fake data, which is typical for privacy and testing.\n- No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries (pytest, sqlalchemy, dotenv) and common patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues and Code Presence\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors are evident; the code appears consistent with its purpose.\n- **Security risks:** No vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are apparent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign **0**.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, no data exfiltration, no code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign **0**.\n- The code is clear, readable, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign **0.2** or **0.3** in some cases, citing reliance on environment variables.\n- While environment variables are standard, in a supply chain context, their use without validation can be a concern.\n- However, since this is test setup code, the risk is minimal.\n- **Justification for a higher score:** If environment variables are misconfigured or contain secrets, that could be risky, but in this context, it’s standard practice.\n\n**Suggested risk score:** **0.2** to **0.3** is reasonable, but since the code is safe and controlled, **0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Anomalies or Concerns\n\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious code patterns.\n- Use of environment variables is typical, but in production, this could be a vector if secrets are mishandled.\n- The sanitization process is standard data masking, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n- **Malware:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk:** Maintain at **0.2**; no need to increase unless environment variables are insecure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code is a typical test setup for database sanitization.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is present.\n- Use of environment variables is standard, with a note that in production, validation is essential.\n- The sanitization process is standard data masking, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No malicious behavior detected.                                               |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**             | Clear, readable code.                                                         |\n| Security Risk   | **0.2**           | Use of environment variables in a testing context; standard practice.        |\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, with no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain risks.",
