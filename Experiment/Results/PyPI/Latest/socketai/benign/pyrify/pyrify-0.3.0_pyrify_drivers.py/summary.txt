  "conclusion": "The code is free of malware and obfuscation but presents a moderate security risk due to dynamic SQL construction without sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection if identifiers are untrusted. The risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. To mitigate this, parameterize or sanitize table and column names before use. Overall, the code is safe in intent but should be used with caution regarding input trustworthiness."
