  "purpose": "This code loads YAML configuration, maps strategies, initializes database drivers, and performs sanitization operations such as cleaning, dropping, or updating database tables and columns based on the configuration.",
  "sources": "The YAML configuration file (via load_config), database URI strings (via get_driver), and strategy names (via get_strategy).",
  "sinks": "Database driver methods (clean_table, drop_table, update_column) which execute SQL commands or data modifications based on untrusted configuration inputs.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from YAML into sanitize_config, strategy names flow into get_strategy, database URIs flow into get_driver, and then driver methods execute database modifications based on configuration and strategies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of strategy.pop('kwargs', {}) mutates local strategy dictionaries but is acceptable in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a configuration-driven database sanitization utility. It loads configuration from YAML, retrieves strategies dynamically, initializes database drivers based on URI prefixes, and performs database operations such as cleaning, dropping, or updating columns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The dynamic strategy and driver selection are standard practices assuming trusted inputs. The potential operational risk exists if configurations are malicious or incorrect, but this is inherent to such tools and not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential impact of executing database commands based on external input but is appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent database sanitization utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores and assessments are consistent and justified. The main operational risk stems from trusting external configurations, not from the code itself.",
