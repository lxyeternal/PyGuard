{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load configuration files, select database strategies, and perform sanitization operations on database tables and columns based on user-defined configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from YAML files (load_config), database URIs (get_driver), and user input via command-line interface (click).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs status messages via click.echo, calls methods on database driver objects (which may execute SQL commands), and raises exceptions on invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Configuration data from YAML is loaded and parsed, then used to determine database operations. The database URI input determines the driver used, which then executes operations such as cleaning or dropping tables. Strategy selection influences how columns are updated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses dynamic data (strategy names, database URIs) but does so in a controlled manner. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code properly loads and validates configuration data, retrieves strategies and database drivers based on input parameters, and performs database modifications accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communications, system manipulation beyond database operations, or data exfiltration. The use of dynamic strategy retrieval appears legitimate, and no suspicious code flows or anomalous data handling were identified. It operates within expected parameters for a sanitization tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate database sanitization utility that loads configuration, selects strategies, and applies database operations without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It follows typical patterns for such tools and does not contain suspicious or malicious code segments.",
