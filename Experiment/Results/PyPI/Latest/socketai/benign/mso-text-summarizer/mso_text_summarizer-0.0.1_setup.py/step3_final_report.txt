  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() call, including package metadata, dependencies, author info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools with static metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, or obfuscated elements. All dependencies are common packages, and the code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or secret handling. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, and no issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
