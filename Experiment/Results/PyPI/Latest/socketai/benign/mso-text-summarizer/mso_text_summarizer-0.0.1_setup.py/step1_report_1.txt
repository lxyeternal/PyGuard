  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools, package metadata, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and invoking 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. No input/output handling, no dynamic code, and no obfuscated elements are present. All dependencies are common scientific packages. The author information is non-sensitive. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
