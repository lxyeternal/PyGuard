  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'mso_text_summarizer' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependencies, and author information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies. It uses 'find_packages()' to automatically discover packages. No suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling are present. The dependencies listed are common data processing libraries, with no signs of malicious intent. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply defines a Python package with its metadata and dependencies.",
