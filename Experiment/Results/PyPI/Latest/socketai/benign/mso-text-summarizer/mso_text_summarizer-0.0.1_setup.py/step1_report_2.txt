  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution details for the Python project 'mso_text_summarizer'.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package discovery via find_packages(), and package metadata such as name, version, author, description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or perform insecure operations. The code only handles static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the setup configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic execution, no input reading from external sources, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no network activity. The dependencies are common packages for NLP and data processing, and the author metadata is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
