  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'mso_text_summarizer' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "N/A (standard setup parameters and dependencies declaration).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems).",
  "flows": "N/A (standard package setup, no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines a setup() function with package metadata, dependencies, and author info. It specifies dependencies like nltk, numpy, datasets, and sumy, which are common in NLP projects. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly manages dependencies and metadata without any suspicious behavior.",
