  "purpose": "Import the function 'run_text_summarization' from a local module 'text_summarizer' for use in text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data input is involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a function, with no data flow or execution beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, which is common in modular Python projects. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import does not execute code or communicate externally. Given the simplicity and context, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, reflecting the safe nature of this code fragment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
