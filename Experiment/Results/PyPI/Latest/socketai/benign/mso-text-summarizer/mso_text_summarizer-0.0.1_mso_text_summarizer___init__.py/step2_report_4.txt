  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet, potential security implications, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .text_summarizer import run_text_summarization\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a simple import statement.\n- It imports a function from a local module (`text_summarizer`).\n- No data processing, network activity, or other suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The module and function names are benign and suggest standard functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import function for text summarization.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is benign, standard, and no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given only an import statement. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the import as benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The zero security risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correct, noting the import is standard.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, no malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, benign import statement.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippet is purely an import statement with no malicious intent, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The security risk score can stay very low, as this code alone does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to being part of a larger codebase, but no direct risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign import statement with no security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated score at 0.\n- Keep security risk score at 0.1 or possibly 0, considering the snippet alone.\n\nThis is a standard import statement with no malicious implications.",
