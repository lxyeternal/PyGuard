  "purpose": "Import the 'run_text_summarization' function from a local module named 'text_summarizer' to perform text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'text_summarizer' and imports a specific function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to potentially calling 'run_text_summarization' elsewhere, but no such calls are shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no anomalies; it does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing a function from a local module. No data input, external network interaction, or potentially malicious behavior is visible. It does not perform any actions on its own. Since it's only an import, the security implications depend on the implementation of 'run_text_summarization', which is not provided. The snippet alone poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks identified within this fragment. It appears to be a standard module import, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
