  "purpose": "Import the function 'run_text_summarization' from a local module 'text_summarizer' for text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'run_text_summarization' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module, which is a common pattern for modular code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are observable. Since it only contains an import statement, it does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. There are no indicators of malware or malicious intent within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase that utilizes the imported function.",
