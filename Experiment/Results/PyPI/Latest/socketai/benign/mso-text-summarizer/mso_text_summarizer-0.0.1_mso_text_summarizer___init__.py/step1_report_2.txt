  "purpose": "Importing the 'run_text_summarization' function from a local module named 'text_summarizer'.",
  "sources": "The code reads local module files, specifically 'text_summarizer'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identifiable within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function from a local module, likely to be used elsewhere in the application. It does not process input data or perform any actions itself. The import statement is standard and does not introduce security risks by itself. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. The minimal nature of this snippet limits the ability to detect malicious intent or security issues within the imported module, which is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import of a function from a local module without any malicious indicators or security concerns evident in this snippet.",
