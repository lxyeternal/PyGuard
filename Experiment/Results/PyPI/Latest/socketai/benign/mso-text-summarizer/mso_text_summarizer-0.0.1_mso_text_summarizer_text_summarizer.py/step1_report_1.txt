{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform text preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and summarization of input text using SVD for extractive summarization.",
  "sources": "Input text from file in run_text_summarization; tokenized sentences from Preprocess; sentence data from text preprocessing.",
  "sinks": "File writing in run_text_summarization (output file); potential in text processing for data leakage or unintended data handling.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> Preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal) -> TF-IDF matrix construction -> SVD decomposition -> Sentence scoring -> Output writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity. The code strictly performs text processing and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code executes standard natural language processing routines: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, TF-IDF calculation, and SVD-based summarization. All operations are consistent with legitimate summarization functions. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. The use of external libraries (NLTK, NumPy) is typical for such tasks. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code structures. It reads and writes files, which is normal for a summarization pipeline. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of extractive text summarization using SVD. It performs standard preprocessing, TF-IDF computation, and sentence ranking based on matrix decomposition. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The code appears safe for use.",
