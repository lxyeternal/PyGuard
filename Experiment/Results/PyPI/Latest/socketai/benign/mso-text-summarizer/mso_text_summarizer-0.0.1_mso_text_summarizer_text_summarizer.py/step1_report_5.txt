{
  "purpose": "The code performs extractive text summarization using TF-IDF, SVD, and sentence scoring.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from a file; processes sentences and words; loads external libraries such as re, nltk, numpy.",
  "sinks": "Writes summary output to a file if specified.",
  "flows": "Input text is read from a file -> Preprocessed into sentences and tokens -> TF-IDF matrix computed -> SVD performed -> Sentence scores calculated -> Top sentences selected -> Output written to file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random seed for eigenvector calculation; no explicit hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script implements standard NLP techniques for summarization, with clear class structures for preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and SVD-based scoring. No external network connections, data leaks, or code injection points are present. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications are evident. The use of random eigenvector initialization is standard for power iteration. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose aligned with summarization tasks, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of extractive summarization with no malicious behavior detected. It processes text securely without external threats or covert operations. The overall security risk is low.",
