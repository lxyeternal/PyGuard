{
  "purpose": "The code implements extractive text summarization using NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and SVD for sentence ranking.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from a file, tokenizes sentences and words, and processes data for TF-IDF and SVD computations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs summarized sentences to a specified output file or returns as a string.",
  "flows": "Input text -> preprocessing (sentence/tokenization) -> TF-IDF matrix -> SVD decomposition -> sentence scoring -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random number generation for eigenvector initialization without seed control, which is standard in such algorithms and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and linear algebra-based summarization. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The use of randomness in eigenvector computation is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of extractive summarization with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the minimal potential for misuse, primarily due to the randomness in eigenvector initialization, which is standard practice.",
