{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through character replacements in 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' functions, converting between characters and emojis.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacements; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No code injections, environment variable uses, or system modifications are present. The design is simple obfuscation without any suspicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for encoding and decoding strings via character-to-emoji mappings. The transformations are symmetrical, providing basic obfuscation. There are no external dependencies, network operations, or any code that manipulates or exfiltrates data. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The only notable aspect is its role as a simple obfuscator, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string obfuscator with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It simply replaces characters with emojis for encoding and reverses the process for decoding. No malware, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
