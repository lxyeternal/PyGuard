{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character substitution-based encryption and decryption methods, likely intended for obfuscation or encoding of strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external data sinks such as network, files, or environment variables are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through replace() chains in encrypt() and decrypt(), converting characters to and from emoji or special symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character replacements; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The substitution is straightforward and not cryptographically secure, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class implements basic character substitution for encoding and decoding. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. The approach is simple and reversible. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects are evident. The code is minimalistic and transparent, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern is misuse of such a method for covert encoding, but that alone does not constitute malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward encoding/decoding utility using character substitutions. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign in its current form, serving purely as a reversible encoding scheme.",
