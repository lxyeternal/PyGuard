  "purpose": "A reversible character-to-emoji substitution cipher for obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings.",
  "sources": "String input to encrypt/decrypt methods, specifically the input string or encrypted token.",
  "sinks": "Replacements within the string during encrypt/decrypt; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string → character replacements in encrypt; encrypted string → character replacements in decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward character replacements with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, symmetrical character-to-emoji substitutions for obfuscation. It contains no external dependencies, network activity, or system modifications. The methods are transparent, with no signs of obfuscation beyond basic replacements. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The substitution is reversible, and the code's behavior is predictable and benign. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports accounts for potential misuse as a covert encoding but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward string obfuscator using emoji substitutions. It does not perform any malicious actions, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The minor security risk score reflects potential misuse for hiding data but does not constitute a security threat. All reports accurately assess the code as safe, with no malware, no obfuscation beyond simple replacements, and minimal security concerns.",
