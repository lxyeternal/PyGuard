{
  "purpose": "This class provides simple obfuscation (encoding and decoding) of strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to encrypt() and decrypt() methods",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the transformed string",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() transformations in encrypt() -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> replace() transformations in decrypt() -> output decrypted string",
  "anomalies": "The code performs only character replacements; no external data sources, network activity, or environmental variables are used. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements straightforward character substitution cipher, converting characters to emojis and back. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, no network operations, and no system commands. The methods are simple and deterministic, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. No obfuscation beyond character replacement, and no complex or hidden logic. The code appears to be a benign string obfuscation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution cipher intended for obfuscation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration, and contains no malicious behaviors.",
