{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic operations, possibly for data processing or utility purposes. There is no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from files, network, or user input explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No outputs to network, files, or environment variables are observed; no sensitive data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "No evident data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly performs internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code detected. The structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes variables, performs calculations, and outputs results. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No external libraries used that raise suspicion. No handling of sensitive data or network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
