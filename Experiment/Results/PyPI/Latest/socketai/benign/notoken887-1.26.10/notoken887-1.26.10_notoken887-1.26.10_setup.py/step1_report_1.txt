  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887' that includes package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for console scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, package discovery via find_packages(), and console script entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no handling of untrusted input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; standard package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Author email uses a known malicious figure's name, and URL points to a suspicious domain; package description and author info appear trivial or obfuscated. No obvious malicious code execution or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with standard setup() parameters. The author email and URL are suspicious but do not indicate malicious code within the setup script itself. The package description suggests obfuscation testing but does not contain actual obfuscated code or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, external code execution, or suspicious imports are present. The script does not load external data or perform any network operations at runtime. Overall, the code appears to be a benign package setup script with some potentially suspicious metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The suspicious author email and URL do not impact the security of the code itself but warrant caution when installing the package from untrusted sources.",
