{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the asciidrawing package by importing modules and executing a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, and the call to cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function call is a sink where untrusted user input might be processed, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the cli() function is invoked immediately, which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code are present. The immediate invocation of cli() is typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' from .core and 'cli' from .cly, then executes cli(). Since the code only consists of module imports and a function call, the primary concern is what the cli() function does. Without the implementation details of cli(), it is impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions. The pattern is common for CLI applications, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization script for a command-line interface. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone. The overall risk is low, assuming cli() is a typical CLI handler.",
