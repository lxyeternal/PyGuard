  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and invoke the CLI interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from internal modules; execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() which may process command-line input or invoke external commands.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; cli() runs possibly with untrusted command-line data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The direct invocation of cli() at import time could be risky if cli() processes untrusted input without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from internal modules and immediately executes cli(). This pattern may lead to unintentional execution upon import, which can be a concern if cli() handles untrusted input insecurely. There are no indications of malicious code or obfuscated logic. The code itself is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices. The main concern is the immediate call to cli(), which could be exploited if not properly secured, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be standard package initialization with an immediate CLI invocation. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The only potential risk is the unconditional call to cli(), which depends on cli()'s implementation for security. Overall, it is unlikely to be malicious.",
