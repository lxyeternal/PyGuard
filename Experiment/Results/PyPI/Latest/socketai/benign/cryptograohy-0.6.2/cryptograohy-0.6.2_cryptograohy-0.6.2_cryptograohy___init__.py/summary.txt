  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI initialization script with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the immediate invocation of 'cli()', which could pose security risks if 'cli()' processes untrusted input insecurely. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) is justified based on the pattern of execution."
