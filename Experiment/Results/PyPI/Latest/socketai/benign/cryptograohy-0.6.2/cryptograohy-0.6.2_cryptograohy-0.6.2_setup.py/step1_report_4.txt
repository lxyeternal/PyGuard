{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'cryptograohy' Python package with a custom post-install command.",
  "sources": "Import statements, fetch_build_eggs, open('/tmp/a'), import of pyprettifier, usage of cryptograohy package",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' (potentially sensitive data), import of pyprettifier (potential for malicious code execution if compromised), execution of setup commands",
  "flows": "Exception handling captures error messages and writes to '/tmp/a'; import of pyprettifier occurs during post-install, which could be malicious if the package is compromised",
  "anomalies": "The code writes exception messages to a temporary file, which might leak sensitive info; the import of 'pyprettifier' is only in post-install, but no obvious malicious code is present; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors evident",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that attempts to fetch build dependencies and execute a post-install action importing 'pyprettifier'. Error handling writes to a temporary file. The setup configuration contains a misspelled package name 'cryptograohy'. The import of 'pyprettifier' could be misused if malicious, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate setup tasks with minimal suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup code is primarily standard with minor anomalies such as error logging to a temporary file and a misspelled package name. No malicious behavior or malware is detected based on this code snippet.",
