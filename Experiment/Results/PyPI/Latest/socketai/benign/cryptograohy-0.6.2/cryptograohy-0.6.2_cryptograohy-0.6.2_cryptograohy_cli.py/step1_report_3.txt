  "purpose": "Initialize and run an emoji conversion utility using the pyprettifier library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pyprettifier; instantiation of EmojiConverter object",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import module -> create EmojiConverter instance",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple CLI function that imports a third-party library, pyprettifier, and creates an instance of EmojiConverter. There is no data input, network communication, or data leakage. The import and object creation are straightforward and typical for a CLI utility. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper around the pyprettifier library's emoji conversion feature. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
