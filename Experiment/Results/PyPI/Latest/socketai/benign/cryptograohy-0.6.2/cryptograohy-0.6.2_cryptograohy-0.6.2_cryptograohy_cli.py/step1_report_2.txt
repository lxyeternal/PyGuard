  "purpose": "Initialize and run the emoji converter from the pyprettifier library via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pyprettifier'; instantiation of 'EmojiConverter' object.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' -> instantiate 'EmojiConverter' -> call 'cli()' which executes 'cli' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple CLI function that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. It then executes the 'cli()' function. The import occurs at runtime within the function scope, which is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. The use of the library appears to be for standard emoji conversion functionality. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, legitimate CLI setup for 'pyprettifier'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
