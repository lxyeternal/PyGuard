{
  "purpose": "The code calculates and displays the Chinese zodiac stems and branches for the current date, supporting multiple languages and custom formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads current date from datetime.date.today(), command-line arguments from argparse, and predefined enums for language, stems, and branches.",
  "sinks": "Uses print() to output formatted strings; no untrusted data sink that writes to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Source (date and args) → calculations (stem and branch) → formatting → output via print(). No external data or untrusted input beyond command-line args.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code performs straightforward calculations and output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines enums for zodiac stems and branches with display methods supporting multiple languages. Functions calculate the zodiac components based on date differences. Command-line arguments determine output format and language. Formatting strings are used to generate output. No external network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution occurs. The calculations rely on fixed base dates and straightforward modular arithmetic. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for zodiac calculations with no malicious behavior detected. It performs simple, well-defined operations without external dependencies or dangerous code patterns.",
