{
  "purpose": "The code calculates and displays the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch for the current date, providing options for language and custom formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads current date from datetime.date.today(), reads command-line arguments via argparse for --lang and --format.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings to the console using print(). No data is written to external sources or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Source: current date and command-line input -> Processing functions (stem_from_year, branch_from_day, etc.) -> Formatting with user-defined template or default display -> print() outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. No use of eval or dynamic code execution. The only notable computation involves date calculations based on fixed base date, which is standard for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard date and calendar calculations for Chinese zodiac components, with no external data sources or network activity. Command-line arguments are used solely for display options. No input is taken from untrusted sources besides CLI, and output is purely to stdout. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. All operations are deterministic and aligned with expected calendar computations. No security risks or malware patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for displaying traditional Chinese calendar elements. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the scope of this code. It safely performs its intended function without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
