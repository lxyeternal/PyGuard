{
  "purpose": "Calculate and display Chinese zodiac stems and branches for the current date, supporting multiple languages and custom formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads current date from system clock; user input via command-line arguments for language and format string.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "Calculates year and day stems and branches based on date differences; formats output based on user preferences.",
  "anomalies": "Uses user-supplied format string in 'format' argument, which could potentially cause formatting errors or vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code performs deterministic date calculations for Chinese zodiac components with clear, straightforward logic. It employs enums for stems and branches, with display methods supporting multiple languages. The date-based calculations are based on fixed base dates, ensuring consistent outputs. The output formatting is flexible, allowing custom templates, but the use of user input in format strings introduces a minor security concern. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of malicious patterns or obfuscation. The only potential risk is format string injection if the user supplies a malicious format string, but since the variables are internally generated and controlled, this risk is minimal. Overall, the code is benign, with negligible security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for calculating and displaying Chinese zodiac components. No malware or obfuscation detected. The only minor concern relates to the format string input, which poses a very low security risk given the controlled variables. The code is well-structured and trustworthy.",
