{
  "purpose": "This code calculates and displays the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch for the current date, supporting multiple languages and custom formatting.",
  "sources": "Input source is the current date obtained via datetime.date.today(). User can also specify format strings via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The format string provided by the user via --format can act as a sink if it contains malicious or unintended variables, leading to formatting errors or code injection in error messages.",
  "flows": "Source (current date) -> Calculations (stem_from_year, branch_from_year, stem_from_day, branch_from_day) -> Output formatting via print, potentially influenced by user-supplied format string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of command-line arguments for language and format does not introduce malicious behavior. No network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs date calculations for traditional Chinese astrology symbols, supports multiple languages, and allows custom output formatting. It uses safe standard library functions, with no external data sources or network activity. The format string supplied by the user could potentially cause formatting errors, but no malicious code execution is possible through Python's string formatting. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, educational, or cultural utility script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The only minor concern is that user-supplied format strings could cause errors, but this is handled gracefully. Overall, the code is safe.",
