  "purpose": "Calculate and display the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch for the current date in various formats and languages.",
  "sources": "Reads current date using datetime.date.today(), reads command-line arguments via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Formats output strings based on user input; no untrusted data is used in critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input: command-line arguments and current date -> Process: calculations of stems and branches -> Output: formatted display strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Usage of standard date calculations and argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward date calculations for traditional Chinese astrology elements, based on fixed base dates and simple modular arithmetic. Command-line argument parsing is standard, with no user input directly influencing system commands or file operations. No data leaks, network communication, or obfuscated code is present. The logic for deriving stems and branches is transparent and uses simple arithmetic. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date calculation script with no malicious intent. It correctly computes and displays traditional astrological elements without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
