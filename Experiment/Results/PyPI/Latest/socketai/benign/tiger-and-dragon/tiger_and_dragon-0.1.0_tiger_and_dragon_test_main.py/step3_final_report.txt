{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the correct calculation of Chinese Zodiac stems and branches based on specific dates, ensuring the functions produce expected outputs for known inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from fixed date inputs within the test cases, such as datetime.date objects representing specific days.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only performs assertions on static data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the fixed date inputs through the imported functions (stem_from_year, branch_from_year, stem_from_day, branch_from_day) to the assertions checking expected zodiac results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests with hardcoded dates and expected zodiac outputs, imported from 'main'. It does not process external or untrusted input, nor does it perform network or file operations. The tests are deterministic and serve to verify correct behavior of the zodiac calculation functions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assertions align with known Chinese Zodiac calculations, and the code structure is standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured test code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all remain at 0, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
