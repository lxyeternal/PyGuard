{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions to verify the correctness of the functions that generate Chinese Zodiac stems and branches based on given years or dates.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hardcoded dates within the test cases and the imported functions from the main module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "The test functions call source functions (`stem_from_year`, `branch_from_year`, `stem_from_day`, `branch_from_day`) with hardcoded date inputs, expecting specific outputs; there are no data flows involving untrusted input to critical points.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward test code with clear assertions.",
  "analysis": "This code imports standard libraries (`datetime`) and testing frameworks (`pytest`), then defines a set of test functions that validate the correctness of zodiac-related functions. The tests use hardcoded dates and expected outputs, serving as validation rather than processing untrusted input or executing dangerous operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code's simplicity and clarity reduce concern for hidden malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of unit tests for verifying zodiac calculations based on dates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present. The code is benign and primarily serves a validation purpose.",
