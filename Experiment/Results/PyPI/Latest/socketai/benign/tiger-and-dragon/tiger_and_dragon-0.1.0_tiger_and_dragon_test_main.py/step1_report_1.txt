{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for functions that determine Chinese Zodiac stems and branches based on year and day inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from datetime.date objects and function parameters (years and specific dates).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; the code does not process external input or produce output that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates and years) is fed into functions; there are no data flows that lead to untrusted or vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears straightforward, with standard testing practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and custom functions, then executes multiple assertions to test correct outputs based on date calculations for Chinese Zodiac stems and branches. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions under test are imported from 'main' but are not shown here, and the tests are typical unit tests. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for verifying date-based calculations of Chinese Zodiac stems and branches. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and poses no security threats.",
