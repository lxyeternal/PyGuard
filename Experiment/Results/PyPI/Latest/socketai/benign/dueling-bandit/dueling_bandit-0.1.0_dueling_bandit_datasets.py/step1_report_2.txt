{
  "purpose": "The code simulates loading datasets for Jester and MovieLens, returning top-k ratings matrices for each dataset.",
  "sources": "Data generation via numpy's random number generator, specifically rng.uniform for ratings and rng.choice for masking missing values.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing ratings matrices, printing status messages.",
  "flows": "Data generated by numpy RNG → masking with choice → selection of top-k indices → return ratings matrix.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy's default_rng to generate synthetic data for two datasets, with masking to simulate missing data. It then selects top-k rows based on the number of ratings. All operations are standard data simulation techniques, with no external network communication, hidden actions, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data simulation for dataset loading purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to generate and return synthetic rating matrices.",
