{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for plotting various statistical metrics related to agent performance across different datasets and budgets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a nested dictionary 'results' parameter, environment variable 'os.path.exists', and potentially reads or creates directories for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "The code writes plots to specified file paths using plt.savefig; no untrusted data is written directly to system files or network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'results' dictionary into plotting functions, which then generate visualizations saved to disk; no data is transmitted externally or executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; the code uses standard libraries and functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines constants and plotting functions. It reads data from structured dictionaries, applies filters, and generates plots with error bars. The directory creation step uses 'os.makedirs' which is safe. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or external network communications. The data handling appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data visualization utility with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain backdoors, network activity, or data theft mechanisms. It appears safe and solely focused on plotting metrics from provided data structures.",
