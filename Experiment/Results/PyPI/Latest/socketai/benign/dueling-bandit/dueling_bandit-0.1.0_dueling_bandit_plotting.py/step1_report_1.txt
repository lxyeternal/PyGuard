{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and save plots of various metrics based on results data, likely for analysis or visualization in research or evaluation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'results' dictionaries, including 'results[budget]', 'results[dataset]', and the 'results' nested dictionaries containing metrics and statistics.",
  "sinks": "File system operations via 'plt.savefig()' and 'os.makedirs()' for saving plots; no other external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the nested results dictionaries into plotting functions, which generate visualizations and optionally save them to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard plotting and file system operations. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines plotting functions for metrics with configurable styles, filters, and error bars. It ensures the output directory exists before saving. All data access is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The data is processed locally for visualization purposes, with no network or system command executions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data visualization utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely handles data and file operations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
