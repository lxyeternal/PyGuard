{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to plot various metrics from nested result dictionaries, saving figures to disk with optional error bars and directory creation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from nested dictionaries (results, results[dataset], res[metric], res[std_key]) and file paths for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "Uses plt.savefig() to write images to disk and os.makedirs() to create directories, both standard operations with no malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from nested dictionaries into plotting functions, then to file system via save_path and directory creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Directory creation based on parameters is standard but could be exploited if inputs are malicious; however, this is typical in visualization scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries for plotting and file management. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The only minor concern is directory creation with user-controlled paths, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but this is common practice and not malicious. The code does not process untrusted external inputs directly; parameters are passed explicitly. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security concern regarding directory creation is justified and does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
