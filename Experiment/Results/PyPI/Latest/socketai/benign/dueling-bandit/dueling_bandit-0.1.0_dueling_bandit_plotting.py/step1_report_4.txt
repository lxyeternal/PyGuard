{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for plotting various metrics related to agent performance across different datasets and budgets, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "User-supplied results data passed as function arguments, environment variables (potentially for os operations), and file system for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "File system when saving plots; potential for malicious file paths if save_path is manipulated; no other external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Results data flows from function inputs into plotting functions; save_path flows from user input into file saving operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward plotting and directory creation functions without obfuscation or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (os, typing, numpy, matplotlib) for data handling and plotting. It defines configuration dictionaries for metrics and agent styles, and two functions for plotting metrics and all metrics over datasets and budgets. The plotting functions validate input, iterate over provided results, and generate plots, saving them to specified paths if provided. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of os.makedirs could potentially create directories based on user input, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It performs standard data plotting operations without any suspicious code or malicious data handling.",
