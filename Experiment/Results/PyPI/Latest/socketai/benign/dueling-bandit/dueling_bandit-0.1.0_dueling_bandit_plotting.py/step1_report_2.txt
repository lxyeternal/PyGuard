{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate plots for various metrics based on results data, primarily for analysis and visualization in a research or monitoring context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'results' data structures passed as parameters, as well as reading datasets and budgets from input parameters and filesystem directories for saving plots.",
  "sinks": "The code writes plot images to the filesystem via plt.savefig and creates directories as needed; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the results dictionary into plotting functions, then visualizations are saved as files. No untrusted external inputs are processed beyond function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and typical plotting routines without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines plotting functions that visualize statistical metrics from provided datasets, using standard Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and os. It includes parameter validation, directory creation, and conditional plotting filters. All operations are typical for data visualization scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common data plotting patterns. No obfuscation or malware-like patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign plotting utility intended for data analysis purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident.",
