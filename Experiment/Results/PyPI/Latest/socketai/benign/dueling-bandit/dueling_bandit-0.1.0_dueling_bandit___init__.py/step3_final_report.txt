  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the package, indicating its current version.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a static string '__version__' to '0.1.0'. It contains no input sources, data flows, external interactions, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is a common pattern for version declaration in Python packages and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports accurately reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
