  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'dueling-bandit'.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The long description content is assigned to 'long_description', which is used during package metadata creation.",
  "flows": "The content from 'README.md' flows from the open() function into the long_description parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected; the script appears to be a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, author info, and other package attributes. It reads 'README.md' for the long description, which is common in Python packaging. No code execution or data handling from untrusted sources is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It performs package configuration only and does not contain any harmful or suspicious logic.",
