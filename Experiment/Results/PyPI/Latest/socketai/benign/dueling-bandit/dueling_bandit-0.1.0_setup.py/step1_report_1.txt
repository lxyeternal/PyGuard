{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'dueling-bandit'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, requirements, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input; the code does not execute or evaluate external input data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed; the code strictly defines package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, specifies package details, dependencies, author info, and classifiers. It reads a README.md file for long description. No execution of untrusted data or dynamic code occurs. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic is present. The code is a standard setup script typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup configuration with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation and appears safe.",
