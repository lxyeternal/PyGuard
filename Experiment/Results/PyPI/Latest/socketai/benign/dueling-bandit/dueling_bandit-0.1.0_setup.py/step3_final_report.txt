{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and configuration for building and distributing a Python library named 'dueling-bandit'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, static package metadata fields, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static data from package metadata and 'README.md' read into setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open(\"README.md\").read()' without error handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python library. It imports 'setuptools', specifies package info, dependencies, author details, and reads 'README.md' for description. There are no dynamic code executions, untrusted input handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. The use of 'open()' without error handling is typical in such scripts and does not introduce security risks. All signals indicate a benign, static configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, which are appropriate given the analysis.",
