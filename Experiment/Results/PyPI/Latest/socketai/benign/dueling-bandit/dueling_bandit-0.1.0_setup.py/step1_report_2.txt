  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration for the 'dueling-bandit' library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'README.md' file read by open('README.md').",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the reading of 'README.md' content and the package metadata; no untrusted data handling or network activity present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is reading the README file into the long_description parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools modules, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and reads the README for description. No user input, untrusted data, or network operations are involved. The code structure and content are typical for Python packaging, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
