  "purpose": "Implementations of various multi-armed bandit agents including Thompson Sampling, random selection, Rank Centrality-based, and contextual variants for decision-making and preference learning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs; internal parameters and RNG seed initialization.",
  "sinks": "No clear data leaks, network calls, or file writes; RNG and parameters are internally managed.",
  "flows": "RNG-generated choices and parameter updates flow within agent methods; no external untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears well-structured for intended algorithms. No hidden or malicious behaviors found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements several standard agent algorithms for preference learning and bandit problems, utilizing numpy and scipy for statistical operations and random number generation. It manages internal state with no external I/O or network activity. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated features, or malicious logic are present. The functions follow expected patterns for such algorithms, and the RNG is used solely for probabilistic sampling and choices. All data flows are contained within the module without external leaks or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing typical multi-agent algorithms without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. There are no indicators of malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
