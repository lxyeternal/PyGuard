  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements multiple ranking agents, with no malicious or suspicious activity. It interacts with environment.duel() and updates internal states.\n\n- **Code verification:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code uses standard libraries (numpy, scipy) responsibly.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external threats or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence aligns with the code's clarity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard ranking algorithms, no external data leaks, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code verification:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. The code interacts with env.duel() but within expected bounds.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — a slight note, perhaps due to environment interactions, but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard multi-armed bandit agents, no external threats, no malicious code.\n\n- **Code verification:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities detected.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements multiple agents, no signs of malicious activity, no external data leaks.\n\n- **Code verification:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard agent implementations, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code verification:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external threats.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear code.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the absence of security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code review.\n\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n- **Estimated scores:**\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n  - **Risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, well-justified, and align with the code's behavior.
