{
  "purpose": "The code implements simulation and evaluation functions for dueling bandit algorithms, enabling analysis of different agents across datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include dataset loading functions load_jester_data and load_movielens_data, environment creation methods (e.g., DuelingBanditEnv.from_ratings), and input parameters like k, d, seed, horizon, and dataset string.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include environment methods (e.g., env.duel, env.best_arm, env.true_order), agent methods (select_pair, update, recommend), and data stored in numpy arrays, but none appear to handle untrusted input directly or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into environment and agent initializations; data from datasets are used to create environments; environment interactions produce data for agent updates; simulation results are stored and summarized in numpy arrays for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. Usage of standard libraries and clear function calls are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for running simulations of bandit algorithms, managing multiple runs with different seeds, datasets, and agents. Environment setup is dynamic based on dataset type, and data collection aligns with expected security practices. No external network connections, file manipulations, or secret handling are present. All data flows and operations appear legitimate and focused on experimental evaluation. The code structure and variable naming are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard simulation framework for bandit algorithm evaluation, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It securely loads datasets, runs experiments, and aggregates results without suspicious activities.",
