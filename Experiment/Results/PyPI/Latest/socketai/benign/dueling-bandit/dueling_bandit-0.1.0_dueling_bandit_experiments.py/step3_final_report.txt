  "purpose": "Simulation framework for evaluating dueling bandit algorithms, involving environment interactions, agent updates, and metrics collection.",
  "sources": "Dataset loaders, environment methods (best_arm, true_order, duel), agent methods (select_pair, update, recommend), internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file operations; all interactions are internal to the simulation environment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment and dataset inputs into the environment object; agent interacts with environment via select_pair and update; results are collected internally and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward simulation setup for bandit algorithms, utilizing standard libraries and internal methods. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code reads data from datasets and environment methods, updates agents, and records metrics without external communication or code injection. The dataset loading and environment interactions are typical and benign. The structure is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured simulation framework for bandit algorithm evaluation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in dataset handling, not malicious intent).",
