{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to run simulations and evaluations of different bandit algorithms in dueling bandit environments, assessing regret, recovery, and rank reporting metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (.environment, .datasets) and loads datasets (load_jester_data, load_movielens_data). It also generates environment instances and seeds for randomness.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include returned dictionaries with simulation metrics; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or networks. No sinks are evident for executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input datasets and environment configurations flow into environment instantiations; data from environment and agents flow into the evaluation metrics collection; seed values are used for randomness; no external data flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically sets up simulation environments, runs multiple iterations with different agents, and records metrics. It utilizes imported modules for environment creation and dataset loading, with no dynamic code execution or external communications. The functions operate purely on in-memory data and standard control flows. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, file operations, or covert data exfiltration, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate simulation and evaluation framework for bandit algorithms, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to compute and aggregate performance metrics in a controlled environment.",
