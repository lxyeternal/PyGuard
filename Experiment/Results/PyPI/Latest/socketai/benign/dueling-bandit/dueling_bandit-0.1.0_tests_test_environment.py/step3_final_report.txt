  "purpose": "Unit test for the DuelingBanditEnv class, verifying environment initialization, duel mechanics, and method outputs.",
  "sources": "Environment creation with fixed seed, method calls on env object (duel, best_arm, true_order, separation).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network, or file operations; assertions verify internal state.",
  "flows": "Environment setup -> method invocations -> assertions; no external data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign unit test with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It uses fixed seeds for deterministic behavior and performs assertions on environment attributes and methods. No external data handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code poses no security concerns, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and functions solely as a unit test. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
