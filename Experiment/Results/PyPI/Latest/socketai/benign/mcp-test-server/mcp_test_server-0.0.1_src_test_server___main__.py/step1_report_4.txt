  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to execute the 'main' function from the 'test_server.server' module when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'test_server.server'; execution block checking '__name__ == \"__main__\"'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' when script is run directly; potential if 'main()' contains untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Code execution flow: import 'main' -> check '__name__' -> call 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and execution pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a 'main' function from a module within the 'test_server' package and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The actual security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main()', which is outside this snippet. The code structure is typical for Python scripts serving as entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point script with no obvious malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet. Its security risk depends on the contents of 'main()'.",
