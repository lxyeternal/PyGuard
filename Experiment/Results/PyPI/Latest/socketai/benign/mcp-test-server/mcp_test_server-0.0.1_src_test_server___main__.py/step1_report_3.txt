  "flows": "Execution flow from script invocation to calling 'main()' imported from 'test_server.server'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; minimal code, straightforward import and execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python entry point that imports a main function from a module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The behavior appears typical for a Python application bootstrap. Without additional context about 'test_server.server.main', there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and conventional script for executing an application entry point. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
