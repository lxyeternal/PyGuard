  "purpose": "Minimal Python entry point that imports and executes main() from test_server.server",
  "sources": "Import statement for main from test_server.server; execution of main() within __main__ guard",
  "sinks": "Execution of external main() function; potential for external code to perform malicious actions if untrusted",
  "flows": "Import main -> call main() if __name__ == '__main__'",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script serving as an entry point, importing main() from an external module and executing it if run directly. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of main() in test_server.server, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself is benign, with no hardcoded secrets or anomalies. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external main() implementation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
