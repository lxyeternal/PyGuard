  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from the test_server.server module when the script runs as the main program.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'main' from 'test_server.server'. The execution of 'main()' if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()', which could potentially execute arbitrary code within that function.",
  "flows": "Import 'main' from 'test_server.server' -> Call 'main()' in the main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the code snippet itself. It is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named 'main' from a module 'test_server.server'. When executed as a script, it calls 'main()'. The code itself does not contain any malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. Its simplicity makes it unlikely to contain hidden malicious behavior within this fragment. The security implications depend on the implementation of 'main()' in the imported module, which is external to this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point script that imports and runs a function from an external module. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent from this code alone. However, without inspecting 'test_server.server.main', we cannot fully guarantee its safety.",
