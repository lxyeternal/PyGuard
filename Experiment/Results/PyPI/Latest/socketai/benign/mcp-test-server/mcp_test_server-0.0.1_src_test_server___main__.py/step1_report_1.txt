  "purpose": "Import and execute the main function from the test_server.server module when the script runs directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from 'test_server.server'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which may contain untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Execution starts with importing 'main', then calls 'main()' when the script runs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function 'main' from a module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior or malicious code within this snippet. The actual security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'main' in 'test_server.server', which is not provided. The code structure is standard for a Python entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard entry point that delegates execution to 'main' in another module. No malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone. Security risks or malware cannot be assessed without inspecting the 'main' function in 'test_server.server'.",
