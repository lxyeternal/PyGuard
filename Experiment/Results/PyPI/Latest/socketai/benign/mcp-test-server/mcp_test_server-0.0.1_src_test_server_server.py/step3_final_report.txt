{
  "purpose": "Implements a simple asynchronous server providing an 'add' tool that sums two string inputs converted to integers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' received via arguments in handle_call_tool; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of 'a' and 'b' to integers and the addition operation; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'a' and 'b' flow from arguments to int conversion, then to addition, and result returned as text content.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out authentication check; direct conversion of inputs without validation; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async server with a tool 'add' that sums two string inputs after converting to integers. The authentication check is commented out, leaving the server unauthenticated, which could be a security concern if re-enabled. Input conversion lacks validation, risking runtime errors but not security vulnerabilities. No external network calls, file I/O, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward addition server with no malicious intent. The main security consideration is the inactive authentication check, which should be enabled or secured for production. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present.",
