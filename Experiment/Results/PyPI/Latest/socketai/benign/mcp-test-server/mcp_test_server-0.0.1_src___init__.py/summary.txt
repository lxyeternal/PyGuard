  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly assess the code as benign, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to eval and obfuscation. Increasing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.3 better reflects the potential risk. The overall security posture remains low, but cautious review is advised for ambiguous patterns."
