  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic execution functions (e.g., eval), hardcoded strings, suspicious patterns, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows such as eval, network connections, file operations, or environment variable access that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources like eval or hardcoded strings may lead to malicious code execution or data exfiltration if used improperly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval, obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, or hardcoded credentials; lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 correctly identifies benign code with no suspicious patterns; scores are appropriate. Report 2 notes ambiguous code with eval and obfuscation, assigning a malware score of 0.2 and obfuscated score of 0.4; given the suspicion, increasing malware score to 0.3 aligns better with the patterns. Report 3 and 5 find no issues, with scores matching their benign assessment. Report 4 lacks code, so scores are appropriate. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, but for Report 2, a slight increase in malware score improves accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly assess the code as benign, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to eval and obfuscation. Increasing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.3 better reflects the potential risk. The overall security posture remains low, but cautious review is advised for ambiguous patterns.",
