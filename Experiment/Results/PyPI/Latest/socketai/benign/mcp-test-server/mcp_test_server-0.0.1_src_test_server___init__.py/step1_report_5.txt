  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable or external sources such as files or network if present, but no explicit sources are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs such as print statements, file writes, or network transmissions. Specific sinks are not explicitly identified due to the lack of concrete code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like 'input_data' through various functions and possibly to sinks such as output functions or external communications, but specifics are unclear without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are visible in the snippet. The code structure appears standard; however, incomplete information limits full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is either incomplete or not visible in this excerpt. Based on the available fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code does not contain obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system calls. Since no external data sources or sinks are explicitly present, and no unusual code constructs are evident, the risk appears low. However, without the full code, some behaviors cannot be fully assessed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code fragment, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to incomplete context, the assessment cannot be definitive. No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns are detected.",
