  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network connections, file reads, user inputs, and code content within the package.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, with potential outputs to network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual code structures, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate minimal or incomplete code snippets with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Confidence scores are high when code is present, and low or zero when code is absent or incomplete. Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), aligning with benign assessments. The reasoning in each report is consistent, and no anomalies are detected. Minor adjustments could be made to risk scores for very incomplete snippets, but overall, the evaluations are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments are cautious and consistent with the evidence, indicating a benign security posture.",
