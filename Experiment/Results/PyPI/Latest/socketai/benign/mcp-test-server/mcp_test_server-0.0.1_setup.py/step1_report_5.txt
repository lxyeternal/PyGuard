{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'test-server' intended to be distributed via PyPI, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Read the package requirements ('install_requires'), package discovery ('find_packages'), and README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "N/A — the script primarily defines package metadata; it does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable — the script sets up package configuration without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard setup procedures and dependency declarations.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard setuptools usage to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The dependencies specified ('fastapi==0.115.12' and 'mcp==1.6.0') are explicitly versioned, indicating controlled dependency management. The package directory is mapped to 'src', which is a common project structure. The README file is read for a detailed description, which is typical for package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present, nor are there any obfuscated elements or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be a standard, benign configuration file used for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It is safe and appropriate for use in a supply chain context.",
