  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file output beyond reading 'README.md'.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration with fixed dependencies and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package info, dependencies with fixed versions, package directory, entry points, and reads a markdown file for description. There are no dynamic or network operations, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns. The reading of 'README.md' lacks exception handling but is standard practice. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
