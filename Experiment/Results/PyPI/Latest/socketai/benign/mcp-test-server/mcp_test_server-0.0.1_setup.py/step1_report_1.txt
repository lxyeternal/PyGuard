  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'test-server' with FastAPI and MCP dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata (name, version, author, description), package directory ('src'), dependencies ('install_requires'), and the README.md file read for long description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; dependencies and package metadata are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated parts. No suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package info, dependencies, entry points, and metadata. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected. The dependencies are fixed versions, and the code reads the README.md for description, which is typical. There are no apparent sources or sinks for malicious activity. The overall structure aligns with common setup.py patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard packaging configuration for a Python project.",
