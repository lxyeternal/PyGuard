  "purpose": "Configure the setup for a Python package named 'test-server', specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "All code originates from the setup() function call, including package metadata, dependency list, and file reading for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, user input, or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md', encoding='utf-8') without try-except could potentially cause issues if the file is missing, but this is standard practice and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, package directory, dependencies, author info, description, and entry points. The dependencies are fixed versions, and the code reads a README file for long description, which is typical. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or execute untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for Python package setup files.",
