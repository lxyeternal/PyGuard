  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'test-server' including package discovery, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including the package directory, packages, entry_points, install_requires, author details, and reading the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "The execution of the setup script itself, which installs dependencies and configures package metadata. No direct data sinks involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads static configuration data, package discovery, and the README.md file. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior are present. The dependencies are specified with fixed versions; the setup script appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are explicitly versioned, and no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or insecure operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard and benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
