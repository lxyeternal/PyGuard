  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python project named 'test-server' with dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import from setuptools, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potential for execution of 'test_server:main' via CLI, reading 'README.md' content.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration flows into package creation, CLI entry point, and reading external files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of 'open' to read 'README.md' is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. All dependencies are explicitly stated with fixed versions. The only external file read is the 'README.md', which is common practice. No suspicious behavior or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal Python package setup configuration without malicious intent or security risks.",
