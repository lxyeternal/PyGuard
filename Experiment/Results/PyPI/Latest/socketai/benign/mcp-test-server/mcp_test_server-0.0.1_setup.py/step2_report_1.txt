  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward setup.py with no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The report correctly notes the absence of anomalies or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0.0, Obfuscated=0.0, Risk=0.0 — appropriate. No adjustments needed.  \n- **Justification:** The report's confidence is high, and the conclusion aligns with the code.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** The mention of potential issues with reading 'README.md' without exception handling is not malicious but could cause runtime errors if the file is missing. However, this is common and not security-related.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The setup script is standard.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** Slightly higher uncertainty (confidence 0.95, risk 0.1). The only concern is reading 'README.md' without error handling, but again, this is typical.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — acceptable given the minor concern.  \n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; the risk score is appropriately low.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Standard setup script.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — suitable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- The only minor point is the reading of 'README.md' without exception handling, but this is a common practice and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of compromise. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
