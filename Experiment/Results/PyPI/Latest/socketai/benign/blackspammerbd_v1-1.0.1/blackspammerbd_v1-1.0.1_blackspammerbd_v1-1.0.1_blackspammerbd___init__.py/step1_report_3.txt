  "purpose": "Importing a class named BlackSpammerBD from a local module named core, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.core). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communication, or data handling functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; the class name 'BlackSpammerBD' could suggest malicious intent based solely on its name, but no actual malicious code or behavior is visible here.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement bringing in a class from a local module. There is no logic, data processing, or external interaction shown. The class name may be suspicious, but without further context or implementation details, it is impossible to determine malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The class name raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. Additional context or code is needed for a thorough assessment.",
