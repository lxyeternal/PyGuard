  "purpose": "Minimal import statement bringing in the class 'BlackSpammerBD' from a local module 'core'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs an import, with no execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no logic, data flow, or malicious actions. The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' could imply malicious intent, but without implementation details, this is purely speculative. The reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and avoid overinterpreting the class name. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately low (0), and security risk scores are minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious behavior. Confidence levels vary but are generally justified given the limited context. Overall, the code appears benign, and suspicion based solely on naming is unwarranted without further implementation details.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The class name alone does not justify higher risk scores. The current assessments and scores are appropriate, but further investigation into the class's implementation is recommended if more context becomes available.",
