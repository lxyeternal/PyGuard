  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'BlackSpammerBD' for use elsewhere in the application; no data flows are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. The module name 'BlackSpammerBD' could imply malicious intent, but without further context, this is speculative.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of a class from a module named 'core'. There is no execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior shown. The class name 'BlackSpammerBD' might suggest malicious or spam-related functionality, but this is not evident from the import statement alone. No code injection, data leakage, or security risks are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The class name could suggest malicious functionality, but this cannot be confirmed without additional context. Overall, the snippet appears benign.",
