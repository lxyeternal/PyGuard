  "anomalies": "Very minimal code with only a comment; no code logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior visible",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable code or data handling present. Without additional code, there are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze. The absence of logic or suspicious patterns suggests a benign intent at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple comment marking the start of package initialization, which is typical and non-malicious.",
