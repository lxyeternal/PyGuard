  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment line; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is only a comment indicating package initialization, with no executable statements, data flows, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the absence of code, malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the minimal content. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code's benign nature is well-supported by the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, being merely a comment with no executable or malicious content. The current security assessment scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
