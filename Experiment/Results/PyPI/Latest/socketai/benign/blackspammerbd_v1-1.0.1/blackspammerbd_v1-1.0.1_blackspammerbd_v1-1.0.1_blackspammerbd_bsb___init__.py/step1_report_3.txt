  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment describing the package initialization. There are no functions, variables, imports, or executable statements to analyze for security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies. Without actual code, it's impossible to identify any source, sink, flow, or anomaly. The lack of code suggests this is just a placeholder or minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "There is no executable code present to evaluate for malicious activity or security risks. The snippet is merely a comment indicating package initialization, which does not pose any security concern.",
