  "purpose": "CLI tool for generating, verifying, listing, encoding, and decoding files with basic interaction features.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'connection_code.txt', files specified by user input, and current directory listing.",
  "sinks": "Writes connection code to a file, writes encoded/decoded data to files, prints output messages.",
  "flows": "User input (commands and arguments) influences file read/write operations and outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random for code generation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no network or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic file operations, base64 encoding/decoding, and simple verification via a generated code. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration functions are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. All data handling appears benign, limited to local filesystem operations and standard output. The random code generator is simple and not cryptographically secure but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or anomalous behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward command-line utility for file encoding, decoding, and simple code verification, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a benign purpose with standard functionalities.",
