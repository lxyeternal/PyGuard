  "purpose": "A CLI tool for generating, verifying, and managing connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files using Base64.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading and writing files ('connection_code.txt', target files, '.b64' files), user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files ('connection_code.txt', encoded/decoded files), printing output to console, listing directory contents.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into command functions; file contents are read for encoding/decoding; connection code verification compares user input with stored code; encoded data is written to new files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' module for generating codes instead of cryptographically secure methods; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious external network calls; file operations are standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that handles file listing, Base64 encoding/decoding, and connection code management. It uses standard libraries and simple file I/O. The connection code generation relies on the 'random' module, which is not cryptographically secure but not inherently malicious. There are no network communications, code injections, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. The functions perform expected behaviors with appropriate error handling. No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign file management utility with no malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads. Its security risk is low, mainly due to the use of non-cryptographically secure code generation for connection codes, which is acceptable in low-security contexts but may be inadequate for security-critical applications.",
