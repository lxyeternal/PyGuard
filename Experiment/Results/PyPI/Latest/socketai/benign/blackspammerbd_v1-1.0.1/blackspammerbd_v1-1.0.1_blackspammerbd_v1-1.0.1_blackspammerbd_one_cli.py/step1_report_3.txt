  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool for managing connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files with Base64.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments, local files (connection_code.txt, target files for download/upload).",
  "sinks": "File reading/writing operations, base64 encoding/decoding, printing to console.",
  "flows": "User inputs command and argument -> code processes argument -> reads/writes files, encodes/decodes data, outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code snippets. Use of random for connection code generation is standard. No evident malicious behavior; code operations are straightforward file and data handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CLI commands for generating a connection code, verifying it, listing directory contents, encoding files to base64, and decoding them back. These operations are typical file and data management tasks. No signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious injections found. All functions rely on standard libraries and typical coding practices. The random connection code is generated securely enough for casual use but does not appear to be used for sensitive authentication. Overall, the script appears benign with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for file encoding, decoding, and simple connection code management. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators. It maintains standard practices and no suspicious operations are present.",
