{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for managing connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files with base64.",
  "sources": "Reading user-provided commands and arguments; reading and writing 'connection_code.txt'; reading and writing files for download and upload commands.",
  "sinks": "Writing connection codes to 'connection_code.txt'; reading files for encoding; writing encoded data to files; reading encoded files for decoding; writing decoded files.",
  "flows": "User input commands (start, connect, list, download, upload) trigger corresponding functions that read arguments, perform file operations, and encode/decode data, with data flow from user input to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of 'random.randint' for code generation is predictable but not malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates file listing, base64 encoding/decoding, and simple connection code management. It uses 'random' for code generation, which is predictable but not malicious. All file operations are straightforward and do not involve external network access or data exfiltration. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are observed. The logic aligns with intended utility rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for managing connection codes and encoding files, with no malicious behavior detected. No security risks or malware indicators are present based on the provided code.",
