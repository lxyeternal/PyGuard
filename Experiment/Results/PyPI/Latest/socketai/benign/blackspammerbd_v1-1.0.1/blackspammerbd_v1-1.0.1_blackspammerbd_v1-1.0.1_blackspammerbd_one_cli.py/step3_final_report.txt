  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility for managing connection codes, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files with base64.",
  "sources": "Reading 'connection_code.txt', listing current directory, reading files for encoding, reading encoded files for decoding.",
  "sinks": "Writing connection code to file, writing encoded/decoded files, printing output messages.",
  "flows": "start_command() generates code -> writes to file; connect_command() reads code from file -> compares with input; download_command() reads file -> encodes -> writes base64; upload_command() reads base64 -> decodes -> writes file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward use of random for code generation; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic file operations and simple session validation via a generated numeric code. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no external network activity or obfuscation. The connection code is generated with 'random.randint', which is predictable but not malicious. Base64 encoding is used for data transformation, not obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions are well-structured, and no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's behavior aligns with benign utility scripts, and no malicious or sabotage indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for file management and session validation. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential for misuse but no actual vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
