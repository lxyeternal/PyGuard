{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for file management, encoding, and connection code handling.",
  "sources": "User input through command-line arguments, reading/writing 'connection_code.txt', reading files for download, reading base64 encoded files for upload.",
  "sinks": "Reading and writing files, base64 encoding/decoding, printing output, and displaying connection codes.",
  "flows": "User supplies command -> code reads arguments -> performs file operations or generates/compares connection codes -> outputs results or saves data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.randint for connection code; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no malicious network activity, no obfuscated code, no data exfiltration or command injection evident.",
  "analysis": "The script generates a random 8-digit connection code and saves it to a file, then allows the user to verify this code. It lists directory contents, encodes files in base64, and decodes base64 files back to binary. All file operations are straightforward and controlled locally. The use of random for code generation is benign. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data theft, or external communication attempts. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. It primarily performs file encoding/decoding and simple verification steps, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for managing connection codes and file encoding. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It operates locally without external network activity or secretive behavior. Overall security risk is low.",
