  "purpose": "CLI utility for generating, verifying connection codes, listing directory contents, and encoding/decoding files in Base64.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, file reads ('connection_code.txt', target files), console output.",
  "sinks": "File system for reading/writing files, console for displaying messages.",
  "flows": "Commands trigger functions that perform file I/O and encoding/decoding; no network activity or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.randint()' for code generation (not cryptographically secure), no input sanitization, but no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool with functions for managing connection codes and file encoding. It reads user commands, performs file operations, and outputs results. No network activity or malicious behavior is present. The only security concern is the use of non-cryptographic randomness for code generation, which is a minor issue. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The code's simplicity and transparency suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The primary security concern is the use of insecure randomness for code generation, which can be improved but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
