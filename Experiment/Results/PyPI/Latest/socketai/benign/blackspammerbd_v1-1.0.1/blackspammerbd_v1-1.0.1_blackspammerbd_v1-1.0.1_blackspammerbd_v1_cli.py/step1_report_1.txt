  "purpose": "This script provides a CLI for generating, verifying connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files in Base64.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments (commands and file names), reading and writing files ('connection_code.txt', specified files, and their Base64 counterparts).",
  "sinks": "Writing connection code to 'connection_code.txt', printing output, reading files for encoding/decoding, and writing encoded/decoded files.",
  "flows": "Input commands from CLI are processed, potentially involving reading user-specified files, encoding/decoding them, and writing results back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of random for code generation is standard. No unusual obfuscation or dynamic code execution. All functions behave as expected for their purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard file operations (list, encode, decode), connection code management, and simple CLI parsing. No external network calls or data exfiltration methods are present. The use of 'random' for code generation is typical for such applications. The code appears straightforward, with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. There is no suspicious data flow or anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for file encoding and connection code management, with no signs of malicious intent. It maintains standard security practices, with no hidden backdoors or malicious data exfiltration.",
