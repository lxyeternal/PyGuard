  "anomalies": [
    "Use of random.randint() for connection code generation without cryptographic randomness (less secure).",
    "No validation or sanitization of file paths; potential risk if manipulated, but currently only operates on user-specified files.",
    "No suspicious code or backdoors, but the encoding/decoding functions could be misused if an attacker supplies malicious files."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file operations, encoding/decoding, and user interactions with no obfuscated code or malicious logic. The code uses straightforward libraries (os, base64, argparse). The code generation uses non-cryptographically secure random, which might be unsuitable for sensitive applications but is not malicious. No network activity, credential theft, or backdoors are present. The functions are simple and transparent, with clear purpose and flow. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this implementation. Overall, the code appears benign with standard operations, though it could be misused if an attacker supplies malicious files or commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for file management and encoding tasks with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic. The security risk is low, primarily due to its benign functionality. The main concern is the use of non-cryptographic randomness for code generation, but this alone does not indicate malicious activity.",
