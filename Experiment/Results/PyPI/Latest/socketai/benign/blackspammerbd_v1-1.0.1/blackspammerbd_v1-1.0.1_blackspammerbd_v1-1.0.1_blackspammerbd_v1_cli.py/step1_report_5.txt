  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI tool for generating, verifying connection codes, listing files, and encoding/decoding files using Base64.",
  "sources": "Reading input from command-line arguments, reading/writing to 'connection_code.txt', reading files for encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'connection_code.txt', printing output to the console, reading files for encoding/decoding, writing encoded/decoded files.",
  "flows": "Input commands from CLI trigger functions that read/write files and encode/decode data, with no external network activity or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random number generator for connection code (not cryptographically secure), no validation or sanitization of file names, no encryption or secure handling of data, no suspicious or backdoor code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code generates and verifies a simple numeric connection code stored in a local file. It lists files and directories without filtering. It encodes files in Base64 and decodes Base64 files back to binary, saving them locally. The use of 'random' for security purposes is weak but not malicious. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected. The functions are straightforward and do not perform unsafe or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign CLI tool for file encoding and connection code management. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security exploits are present. The only minor concern is the weak randomness source for the connection code, which could be improved for security, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
