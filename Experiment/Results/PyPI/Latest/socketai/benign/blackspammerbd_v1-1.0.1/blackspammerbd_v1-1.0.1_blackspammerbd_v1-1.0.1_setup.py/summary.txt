  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign and standard. No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code exists within this script. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of 'cli:main', which is outside the scope of this code review. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are correct; the low security risk score is justified given the potential for malicious behavior in the CLI module, but not in the setup script itself."
