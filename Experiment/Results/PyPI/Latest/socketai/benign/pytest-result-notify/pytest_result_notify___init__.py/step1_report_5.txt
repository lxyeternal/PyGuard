  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or system interaction, but without the actual code, it is unclear whether it serves a legitimate function or contains malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources might include environment variables, user inputs, or file reads, but none are explicitly shown due to lack of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writing, or system commands, but specifics are unavailable without code content.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink data flows cannot be determined without code; typically, this would involve untrusted input passing into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to absence of code. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated segments are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided input does not include any code to analyze. Therefore, no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be identified. Without code content, it is impossible to evaluate for malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to assess the code. Cannot determine malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation status without actual code content.",
