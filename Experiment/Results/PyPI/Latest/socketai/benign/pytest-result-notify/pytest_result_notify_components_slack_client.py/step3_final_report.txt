  "purpose": "Provides a Slack messaging client with functions to format and send messages via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Slack API token in the constructor, request data in send_slack_msg method.",
  "sinks": "requests.post call to the Slack API endpoint, potential data leakage if token is exposed.",
  "flows": "Token is used in headers for requests.post; no external untrusted input flows into sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API token, which is a security concern; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with functions to assemble and send Slack messages. The primary security issue is the hardcoded token, which could lead to credential leakage if the source code is exposed. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is present. The malware score is appropriately 0. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score should be high due to the embedded credentials; I estimate approximately 0.8, reflecting the severity of credential exposure and potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but insecure due to the hardcoded Slack API token. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is credential management, which warrants a high security risk score (~0.8). Recommendations include removing the hardcoded token and using environment variables for secure credential handling.",
