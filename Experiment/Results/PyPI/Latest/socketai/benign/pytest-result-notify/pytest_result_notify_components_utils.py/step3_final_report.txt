  "purpose": "Convert seconds into a human-readable time format with specific rules for minutes and seconds.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seconds' used for calculations and formatting.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' flows through conditional checks and recursion to produce formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of recursion for formatting remaining seconds; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility function that converts seconds into a human-readable string, employing a list of time units and recursion for formatting. It contains no external data access, network calls, obfuscation, or malicious code. The logic is simple, with specific formatting rules for durations less than 10 minutes. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports is unwarranted; the code's simplicity warrants a score of 0. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with high confidence and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility function with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate; the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
