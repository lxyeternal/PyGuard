{
  "purpose": "Convert a given number of seconds into a human-readable time format with specific rules for minutes and seconds.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seconds' for time value; no external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' is processed through iterations and recursive calls to format_time to produce a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "None; code uses straightforward arithmetic and recursion without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a list of time units with their durations in seconds. It iterates over these units, converting the input seconds into the largest applicable unit. For minutes less than 10, it outputs seconds instead of minutes. It uses recursion to format remaining time. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or security-sensitive actions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious utility for formatting time durations. It contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are evident.",
