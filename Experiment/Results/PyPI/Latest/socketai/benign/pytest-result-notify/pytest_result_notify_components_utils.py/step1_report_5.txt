{
  "purpose": "Convert a given number of seconds into a human-readable time format with specific handling for durations over 10 minutes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seconds' (function argument).",
  "sinks": "Return statement producing formatted string output.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' is processed in a loop to determine the appropriate time unit; the formatted string is generated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs present. Use of recursion for formatting, but benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates through a list of time units from largest to smallest, selecting the most appropriate unit for the input seconds. It formats the output string based on the value, with special handling to revert to seconds if the duration is less than 10 minutes. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, external data access, or obfuscation. No external network calls, file operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The only notable logic is the formatting rule for durations less than 10 minutes, but it does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious utility function for time formatting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It operates solely on input data and produces formatted output without side effects.",
