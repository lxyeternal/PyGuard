{
  "purpose": "Convert a given number of seconds into a human-readable time format with specific rules for minutes.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'seconds' and the modulus operation for 'remainder'.",
  "sinks": "The string formatting functions that output the formatted time string.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' is processed to determine the appropriate time unit and formatting; the output is a formatted string describing the time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No use of eval, exec, or network operations. The recursion is straightforward for formatting.",
  "analysis": "The function performs time conversion by iterating through a list of time units. It applies specific formatting rules for minutes less than 10, converting to seconds. The recursion on 'format_time(remainder)' appears intended for multi-unit formatting but is implemented in a standard manner. There is no suspicious or malicious logic, code injection, or data leakage observed. No external data sources, network calls, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard time formatting function with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely to convert seconds into a human-readable string. No malware or security vulnerabilities detected.",
