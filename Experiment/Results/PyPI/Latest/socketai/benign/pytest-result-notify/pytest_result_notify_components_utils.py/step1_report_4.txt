{
  "purpose": "The function converts a given number of seconds into a human-readable time format with specific rules for minutes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'seconds' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write to external systems, files, network, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' is used for calculations and formatting within the function; no external data flows out.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses recursion for formatting, which is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The function iterates through time units, converting seconds to appropriate units, with special handling when the unit is minutes and the value is less than 10, returning seconds in those cases. The recursive call formats the remaining seconds. No external or dangerous operations are present. The code is primarily focused on formatting and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard time formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward calculations and string formatting, with no external data access or dangerous behaviors.",
