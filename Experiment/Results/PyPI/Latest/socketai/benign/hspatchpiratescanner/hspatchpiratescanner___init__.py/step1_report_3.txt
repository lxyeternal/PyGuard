{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'hspatchpiratescanner' and assigns its docstring and __all__ attribute to the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.hspatchpiratescanner', reading module attributes '__doc__' and '__all__'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points; no use of untrusted input, environment variables, or external data sources",
  "flows": "Import source flows into current module namespace; no data flows to external systems or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can conceal imported code, but this is common in __init__.py files; no suspicious code execution or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely re-exports contents from the 'hspatchpiratescanner' module, assigning its docstring and __all__ attributes. There are no data processing, network communication, or potentially malicious behaviors. The use of 'import *' is typical in package init files and does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple re-export module, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely forwards attributes from a local module.",
