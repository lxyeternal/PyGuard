  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a module that imports everything from `.hspatchpiratescanner` and assigns its `__doc__` and `__all__` attributes.\n- The code uses `from .hspatchpiratescanner import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No reports indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or handling untrusted input.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern beyond best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code simply re-exports symbols from another module without any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware presence:** Consistently scored as 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code is found.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, scores of 0.1 are acceptable, acknowledging the use of wildcard import as a best practice concern rather than a security flaw.\n\n### Potential issues or points of contention:\n\n- The use of `import *` is flagged as a concern but not as malicious. This is appropriate.\n- No report suggests any code that could be malicious or hidden.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless future code reveals hidden behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to coding style concerns)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and aligns with the reports' assessments. The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a simple re-exporter, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The scores reflect a low security risk, with no evidence of malware.  \n- No changes are recommended based on the current reports.",
