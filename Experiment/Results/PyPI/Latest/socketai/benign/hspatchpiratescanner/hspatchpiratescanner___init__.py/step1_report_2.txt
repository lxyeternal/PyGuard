{
  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the 'hspatchpiratescanner' module and assigns its documentation string and __all__ attribute to the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.hspatchpiratescanner' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data output or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; merely re-exporting module contents",
  "anomalies": "Uses wildcard import which can obscure imported contents; no explicit evidence of malicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a local module and re-exports its documentation and __all__ attribute if present. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. Wildcard import may hide imported functions or variables, but this alone is not malicious. The code structure is minimal and does not exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving primarily as a wrapper or re-exporter for another module's contents. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
