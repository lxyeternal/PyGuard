{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'hspatchpiratescanner' and sets module documentation and __all__ attribute accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'hspatchpiratescanner' module and accesses its __doc__ and __all__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the module and assigning its attributes to the current module's namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import ('from .hspatchpiratescanner import *'), which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual behavior is present beyond this.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of a module's contents and copies its documentation string and __all__ list if available. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The only concern is the use of wildcard import, which can be risky but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, this is a simple module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is a best practice concern but not an indication of malicious intent. No security risks are evident from this snippet.",
