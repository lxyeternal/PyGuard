{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify used network ports and find available free ports within a specified range, likely for setting up network services or applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads system network connection data via psutil.net_connections() to identify used ports.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly send data or execute untrusted inputs; it mainly retrieves system information without performing actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The source (net_connections data) flows into the get_used_ports function, which filters and returns used ports; this information is then used in get_free_ports and get_free_port to determine available ports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The code relies on standard psutil library calls and logging for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically retrieves current network connection data to identify used ports. It then calculates available ports within a specified range, raising exceptions if none are available. The logic is straightforward, with appropriate exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior, and no obfuscated or harmful code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing network ports, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within normal parameters, utilizing psutil to gather system network information for legitimate purposes.",
