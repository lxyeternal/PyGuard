{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify network port usage and find available free ports within a specified range.",
  "sources": "psutil.net_connections() retrieves current network connection details from the operating system.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data externally or perform dangerous actions; it primarily reads system network info.",
  "flows": "The code reads system network connections (source) and processes this data internally to determine free ports (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses psutil to enumerate active network connections and determine which ports are in use. It then identifies free ports within a range, supporting port allocation for applications. Error handling is present for permission issues and general exceptions. No external data transmission, code injection, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code operates solely on system info and standard library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for port management without malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper error handling and no suspicious behavior detected.",
