  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**1. Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment**: The report states the code is a legitimate port utility with no malicious intent. It notes proper error handling and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Evaluation**: The code only reads system network info via psutil, with no external data transmission or malicious logic. The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the potential for misuse (e.g., port scanning), it’s acceptable.\n- **Conclusion**: No issues found. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**2. Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard usage of psutil for port info, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation**: Perfectly aligns with the code’s behavior. No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**3. Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment**: Same as above, consistent with the code’s purpose and behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Evaluation**: Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) is justified, considering the code can be used for port scanning, which might be misused maliciously, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Conclusion**: Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**4. Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment**: Again, a standard port management utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Evaluation**: Perfectly aligned with the code’s benign nature.\n- **Conclusion**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**5. Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment**: Similar to previous reports, with detailed flow analysis and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Evaluation**: Slightly lower securityRisk score, which is justified given the code’s safe operations.\n- **Conclusion**: Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code. No malicious activity or payloads are detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores**: Mostly between 0.1 and 0.2, justified by the fact that port scanning or port enumeration can be misused in malicious contexts, but the code itself is harmless.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — low, but considering potential misuse, slightly above zero is reasonable.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate system utility with minimal security risk, primarily related to its potential use in port scanning activities, which are not inherently malicious but could be misused.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: No changes to the scores are necessary. The analysis aligns with the code's behavior and the reasoning provided.",
