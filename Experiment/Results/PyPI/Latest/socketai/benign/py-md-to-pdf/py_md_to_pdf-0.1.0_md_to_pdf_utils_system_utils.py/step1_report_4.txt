{
  "purpose": "The code identifies used network ports and allocates free ports within a specified range, likely for setting up network services or tests.",
  "sources": "psutil.net_connections() to read current network connection states.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "get_used_ports() reads current connections, get_free_ports() and get_free_port() use this data to find available ports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard network port scanning and allocation functions without suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes psutil to retrieve active network connections, filtering for established or listening states, to determine used ports. It then identifies available ports within a specified range for potential use. No hardcoded credentials, malicious system modifications, or external data transmissions are observed. The code handles exceptions gracefully and logs errors, indicating standard operational behavior. There are no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The functions serve straightforward purposes related to network port management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing network ports, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and intended for typical network setup or testing purposes.",
