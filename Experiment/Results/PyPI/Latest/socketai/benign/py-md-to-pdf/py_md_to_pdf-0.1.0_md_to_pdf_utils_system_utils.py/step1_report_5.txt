{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify used and free network ports on the local machine, likely for purposes such as network service setup or dynamic port allocation.",
  "sources": "psutil.net_connections() to gather active network connections, reading connection attributes such as local address and port.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present. The code primarily reads system information and logs errors.",
  "flows": "Retrieves active connections -> filters by connection status -> collects ports -> identifies free ports based on used ports -> returns available ports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses psutil to access network connection data, filtering for established and listening connections. It then computes available ports within a specified range, raising an exception if none are available. Logging is used for error reporting. The functionality aligns with standard port management tasks and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate network port querying and allocation functions without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility script for port management.",
