  "purpose": "Retrieve current network connections to identify used ports and find free ports within a specified range.",
  "sources": "psutil.net_connections() to read active network connections and their local addresses.",
  "sinks": "None; the code processes data internally without transmitting or storing untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads system network info (source), filters for established/listening connections, collects local ports, compares with port range to find free ports.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses psutil to access network connection info, filters for relevant connection statuses, and identifies used ports. It handles permission errors gracefully and raises exceptions if no free ports are available. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is a standard port management utility with minimal security implications. The security risk is low, primarily because port scanning can be misused, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system utility for port management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, and malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. No modifications are necessary.",
