{
  "purpose": "The code aims to retrieve network port information, specifically used ports and free ports within a specified range.",
  "sources": "Reading network connection data from psutil.net_connections()",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input in a harmful way or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from psutil.net_connections() (source) into used_ports set, then used in get_free_ports and get_free_port functions to determine available ports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. Usage of psutil is standard; error handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code uses psutil to retrieve active network connections, identifies used ports, and determines free ports within a range. Error handling accounts for permission issues. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code serves a legitimate purpose of network port management without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for network port management, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It operates safely within its scope, performing typical network port queries and calculations.",
