  "purpose": "Test the md_to_pdf function with a sample markdown content containing headers, code blocks, and a table.",
  "sources": "The markdown_content string within the test function.",
  "sinks": "The md_to_pdf function which processes the markdown input.",
  "flows": "Input markdown_content -> md_to_pdf processing -> PDF output (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. No external data sources or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple asynchronous test case invoking md_to_pdf with static markdown content. The content includes headers, code snippets, and a table, with no signs of malicious code or vulnerabilities. The provided reports are empty, indicating no analysis or findings. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations beyond static content, or dynamic execution. Given the lack of evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is minimal. The malware score is zero, obfuscation is absent, and risk scores should be very low, close to zero, consistent with the absence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no detected malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports are incomplete, providing no evidence of issues. Scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score.",
