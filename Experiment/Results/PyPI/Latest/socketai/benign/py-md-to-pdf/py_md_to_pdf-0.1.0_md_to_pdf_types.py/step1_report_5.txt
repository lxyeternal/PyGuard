  "purpose": "The code defines configuration classes and functions for rendering Markdown to PDF or HTML, including styling and rendering options.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for styling, rendering options, and file paths from class attributes and function defaults.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs configuration objects and style content; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing is observed.",
  "flows": "The function get_default_pdf_config() generates style definitions and returns a PdfConfig object, incorporating style CSS and markdown options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. The code mainly sets up configurations without executing external commands or network operations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for Markdown and PDF rendering, utilizing standard libraries like pygments and dataclasses. All attributes are initialized with safe defaults or empty structures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The code only constructs configuration objects and style strings, which are benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Markdown and PDF rendering, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
