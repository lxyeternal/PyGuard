  "purpose": "Defines configuration data classes and functions for rendering Markdown documents into HTML or PDF with styling options.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries (dataclasses, typing), external 'pygments' library for style generation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network activity, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Configuration data setup, style generation, and CSS content assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward static configuration. Minor duplicate CSS rule, but not security-relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs data classes for configuration, generates CSS styles using 'pygments', and sets default options for PDF and HTML rendering. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network calls, or handle untrusted input. The use of 'pygments' for style generation is standard and safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The 'port' attribute defaults to 0, which is acceptable as a configuration detail. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and purely for setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module for document rendering with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
