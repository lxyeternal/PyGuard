{
  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures and default settings for generating markdown, HTML, and PDF documents with styling, scripts, and rendering options.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration defaults, library imports, and method calls to generate style definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves the get_default_pdf_config() function generating CSS and configuration objects, with no external input or output beyond configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code primarily defines data classes and a function to generate default configurations. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or code injection is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for typing and styling, defines several data classes for configuration, and a function to generate default PDF configuration. It constructs CSS styles and Pygments style definitions for syntax highlighting. No dynamic execution, user input processing, or external data handling is observed. The structure appears standard for configuration management, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for document rendering purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It safely sets up styles and options for PDF and HTML generation without any suspicious activity.",
