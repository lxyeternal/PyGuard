  "purpose": "Convert Markdown content to a PDF document by generating HTML and rendering it using a browser automation tool.",
  "sources": "Input Markdown string (md_content), configuration objects (config), and browser object (browser).",
  "sinks": "Browser methods (setContent, pdf, close), which process HTML and generate PDF bytes.",
  "flows": "Markdown input -> get_html() generates HTML -> generate_output() renders HTML in browser and produces PDF -> md_to_pdf() orchestrates the process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries and browser automation without suspicious extensions or network calls. No obfuscated code or malicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code transforms Markdown into HTML, then uses a headless browser (pyppeteer) to generate a PDF. The functions are straightforward, employing standard library calls and safe data flow. The configuration parameters are extracted via object_utils, which appears to be a utility function, with no evidence of malicious manipulation. The only potential concern is if the configuration allows injection or malicious scripts via the HTML or CSS, but no such injections are apparent in the code. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It relies on external libraries and provided inputs, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Markdown to PDF conversion using a headless browser. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears safe under normal use, assuming the inputs are from trusted sources.",
