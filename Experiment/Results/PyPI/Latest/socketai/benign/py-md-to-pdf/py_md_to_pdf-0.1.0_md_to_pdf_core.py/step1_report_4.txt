  "purpose": "Convert Markdown content to PDF by rendering HTML and using a headless browser",
  "sources": "md_content input parameter, config parameters (markdown options, pdf options), environment variables used in imported modules",
  "sinks": "browser.newPage(), page.setContent(), page.pdf(), page.close()",
  "flows": "md_content -> get_html() -> html_content -> generate_output() -> PDF bytes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports beyond standard libraries and known packages, no network activity, no code injection points identified",
  "analysis": "The code converts Markdown to HTML and then renders it into PDF using pyppeteer. It reads configuration options for markdown rendering and PDF options, including headers and footers. The use of pyppeteer appears to be standard for rendering HTML to PDF. No data leaks, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present. All input data is processed locally without external data sources. The only external dependencies are standard and open-source libraries, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for Markdown to PDF conversion using a headless browser. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe, assuming external libraries are trustworthy.",
