  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Markdown-to-PDF converter with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is input sanitization to prevent injection if inputs are untrusted. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior and are appropriate given the low risk profile."
