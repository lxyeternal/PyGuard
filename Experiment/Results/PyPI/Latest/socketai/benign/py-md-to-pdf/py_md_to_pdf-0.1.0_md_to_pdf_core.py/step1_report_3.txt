  "purpose": "Convert Markdown content into a PDF document using a headless browser, with customizable HTML and PDF options.",
  "sources": "md_content input parameter, config parameters (markdown options, document title, CSS, body class, PDF options), object_utils.get function",
  "sinks": "browser.newPage(), page.setContent(), page.pdf(), page.close()",
  "flows": "md_content is converted into HTML, then set as page content in the headless browser, and finally PDF bytes are generated from the page",
  "anomalies": "Use of object_utils.get for optional config retrieval is normal; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated code is present; no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious payloads observed",
  "analysis": "The code converts Markdown to HTML and then uses a headless browser to generate a PDF. It handles configuration options for markdown rendering and PDF output. No input validation or sanitization is evident, but given that markdown is a typical input, this is standard. No suspicious code or malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is detected. Usage of a headless browser API is appropriate for rendering PDFs. The logic to enable headers/footers is straightforward. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Markdown-to-PDF conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
