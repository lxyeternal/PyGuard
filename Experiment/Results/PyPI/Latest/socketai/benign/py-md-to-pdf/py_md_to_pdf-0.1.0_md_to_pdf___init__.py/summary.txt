  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for markdown to PDF conversion with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern relates to environment variable control, which is a common configuration practice but could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
