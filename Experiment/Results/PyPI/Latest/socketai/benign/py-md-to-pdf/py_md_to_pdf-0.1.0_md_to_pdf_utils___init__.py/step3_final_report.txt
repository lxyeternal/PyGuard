  "purpose": "Analyze the open-source dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on code signals and reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, network activity indicators, hardcoded URLs, dynamic execution points, suspicious data flows, absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, data leaks, command execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as network activity or data inputs leading to sinks like network connections or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.9), dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, hardcoded URLs, inconsistent or missing code content.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious network activity and hardcoded URLs in the most concerning report. Reports lacking code or with empty snippets are correctly scored as benign. Moderate suspicion in some reports is justified by signs of obfuscation and data flow anomalies. The highest malware score (0.75) aligns with strong indicators in Report 1. Slightly elevated obfuscation scores (around 0.8) reflect the suspicion level. The overall security risk scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating high concern primarily in Report 1, moderate in Report 4, and low in others.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 presents high suspicion with signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and high obfuscation (0.9). Report 4 shows moderate suspicion, justifying a malware score around 0.5 and obfuscation around 0.7. Reports 2, 3, and 5 are benign with scores near zero. Overall, the dependency exhibits significant malicious indicators in Report 1, with moderate concern in Report 4, and minimal risk elsewhere.",
