  "conclusion": "Report 1 presents high suspicion with signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and high obfuscation (0.9). Report 4 shows moderate suspicion, justifying a malware score around 0.5 and obfuscation around 0.7. Reports 2, 3, and 5 are benign with scores near zero. Overall, the dependency exhibits significant malicious indicators in Report 1, with moderate concern in Report 4, and minimal risk elsewhere."
