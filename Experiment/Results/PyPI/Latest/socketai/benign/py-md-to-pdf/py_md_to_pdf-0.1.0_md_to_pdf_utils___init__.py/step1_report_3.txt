  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility for handling data or executing specific functions, but no explicit purpose is clear without seeing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from function parameters, environment variables, or file I/O (if present). Specific source points cannot be identified without actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations (e.g., socket or HTTP requests), file writing, executing system commands, or eval/exec calls, depending on code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or variables, possibly involving data transformations. Exact paths cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident from the provided snippet; however, the snippet is empty, limiting analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is empty, providing no details for analysis. Without actual code content, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, or flows, or to spot anomalies or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet is insufficient for detailed analysis, and no malicious activity can be confirmed.",
