  "purpose": "Package configuration for a pytest plugin named 'pytest_gradescope'.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package metadata, plugin entry points, and classifiers; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, discover packages excluding certain directories, register a pytest plugin via entry_points, and specify classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices support the conclusion of no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script for a pytest plugin, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
