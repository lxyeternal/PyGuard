{
  "purpose": "Configure and package a pytest plugin named 'pytest_gradescope' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools, configuration parameters in setup() including package discovery, entry points, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious behavior; no external network or data leak operations.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration defines package metadata and entry points but does not include any dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with parameters to define package name, find packages excluding certain directories, and specify an entry point for pytest plugin registration. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or malicious code patterns are present. It is a straightforward package configuration script commonly used for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script used for packaging a pytest plugin. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the code.",
