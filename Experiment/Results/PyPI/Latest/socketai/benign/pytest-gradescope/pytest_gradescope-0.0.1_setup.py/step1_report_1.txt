{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package named 'pytest_gradescope' for distribution, including plugin registration for pytest.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools for setup and find_packages, and the setup() function call with its parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code only performs package configuration and registration.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining package metadata and registering a pytest plugin via entry_points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of setuptools for package setup. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, excludes certain directories, registers a pytest plugin through entry_points, and specifies classifiers. All actions are typical for Python package setup files. No indication of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern reduce the likelihood of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with pytest plugin registration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe for use.",
