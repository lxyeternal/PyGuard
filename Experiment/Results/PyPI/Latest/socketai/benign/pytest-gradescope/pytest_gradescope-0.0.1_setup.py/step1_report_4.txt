{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to configure and package a Python plugin named 'pytest_gradescope' for distribution via PyPI, enabling its integration with pytest as a plugin.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies with 'find_packages', configuration parameters like 'name', 'entry_points', and 'classifiers' for setup.",
  "sinks": "The 'entry_points' may register the plugin for pytest; no direct data sinks are evident that process untrusted data or cause data leakage.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata to plugin registration, without any dynamic execution or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code follows standard setup.py structure without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, specifies package inclusion rules, defines plugin entry points for pytest, and includes classifiers. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or external network activity are present. It appears to be a straightforward packaging script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a pytest plugin with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
