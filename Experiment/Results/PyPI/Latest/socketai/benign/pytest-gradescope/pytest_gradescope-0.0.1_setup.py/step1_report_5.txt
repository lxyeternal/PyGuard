{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'pytest_gradescope', including package discovery and pytest plugin registration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools; data from setup() parameters such as 'name', 'packages', 'entry_points', and 'classifiers'.",
  "sinks": "The 'entry_points' may dynamically register plugins, but no untrusted data is used; no sinks that could cause data leaks or code execution from untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Static data (package name, plugin registration string) flows into setup configuration without any dynamic or untrusted input affecting execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard Python packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and registers a pytest plugin via 'entry_points'. All data is static and directly written into the script. No user input or external data sources are used. The plugin registration appears straightforward and intended for pytest extension, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard packaging conventions and lacks suspicious or harmful constructs.",
