{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for SMS request, response, webhook payload, and status enumeration used in an SMS sending and receiving API.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from API request bodies, environment variables, or external API responses (not explicitly shown but implied).",
  "sinks": "Data output to API responses, logs, or webhook callbacks; no explicit sinks performing malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from external API requests into data models; responses and webhook payloads are generated based on these models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual logic observed. String constraints are used appropriately; no unsafe code constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Pydantic models and an Enum for handling SMS data. There are no sources or sinks with untrusted data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no external system calls. The data validation appears standard and safe. The documentation is clear and does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of data models for SMS messaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for use in an SMS API system.",
