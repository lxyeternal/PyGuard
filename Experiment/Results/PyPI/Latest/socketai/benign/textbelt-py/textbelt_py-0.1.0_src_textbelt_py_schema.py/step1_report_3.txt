{
  "purpose": "Define data models for SMS request, response, webhook payload, and status using Pydantic for validation and type enforcement.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided SMS details, webhook payloads, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging or processing untrusted webhook payload data, which could be exploited if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Input data from external sources (user input, webhook POST requests) flow into data models, especially from webhook payloads into application logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no evident malicious logic or backdoors present. String constraints are properly used for length validation but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward Pydantic data models used for SMS request/response handling and webhook processing. No input data processing involves insecure handling, no code injection points are evident, and no external commands or unsafe operations are present. The enum for SMS status is standard. The code appears to be a clean, well-structured data model definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining data models for SMS communication without any malicious or suspicious features. It appears safe and aligned with standard practices for input validation and API data modeling.",
