{
  "purpose": "Define data models for handling SMS request/response, webhook payload, and status updates in a messaging system.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; data models are designed to receive input from external sources such as API requests and webhook calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code defines data schemas but does not perform any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into models like SMSRequest and WebhookPayload, and responses are modeled via SMSResponse and SMSStatusResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, and no unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines Pydantic data models for SMS messaging, including request parameters, responses, webhook payloads, and status enums. It uses standard Python practices and libraries without any dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data schemas for an SMS messaging API, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured and does not contain suspicious or malicious logic.",
