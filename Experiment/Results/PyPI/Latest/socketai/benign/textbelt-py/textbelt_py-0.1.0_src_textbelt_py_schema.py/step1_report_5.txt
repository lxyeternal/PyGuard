{
  "purpose": "Define data models for SMS request, response, webhook payload, and status using Pydantic for validation and type safety.",
  "sources": "User input data from API requests (e.g., SMS request, webhook payload), environment variables (not present here), or external services (SMS provider responses).",
  "sinks": "Data returned or sent to external services (SMS provider API, webhook URLs), or stored within the application. No direct sink of untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., from user or webhook) flows into models for validation, then potentially to external APIs or storage; responses and status are modeled for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of Pydantic models appears standard and secure. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured data models for SMS-related operations using Pydantic, ensuring validation and type safety. No external data reading, insecure handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of Enum for status is standard. The annotations and constraints are typical for validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, secret leakage, or supply chain sabotage in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models for SMS messaging operations with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and suitable for its purpose.",
