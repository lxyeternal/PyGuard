  "purpose": "Define data schemas for SMS requests, responses, webhook payloads, and status enums for an SMS API.",
  "sources": "Input data fields such as phone, message, webhook URLs, and webhook data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data validation occurs within models, no processing of untrusted data beyond validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into models; no processing or external calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic models for SMS request/response, webhook payload, and status enum. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of secrets. The code is well-structured, with appropriate validation constraints. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'str | None' is valid in Python 3.10+, and StringConstraints is used correctly. Minor typos in docstrings do not impact security. The models are purely data schemas, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data models for an SMS API, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
