  "purpose": "Define data models for SMS request, response, webhook payload, and status enumeration used in an SMS messaging system.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include SMS request parameters, webhook payload data, and status enums.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the raw data fields that could be used in logs, external API calls, or responses; no direct untrusted data handling or execution points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (via request models) to webhook payloads and responses, but no untrusted data is processed insecurely or leads to system commands or external system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. Use of standard data modeling with Pydantic and Enums is safe and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for an SMS service, including request, response, webhook payload, and status enums. No code executes external commands, manipulates data insecurely, or contains obfuscated elements. The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition for API data exchange, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data models for an SMS messaging API with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and uses Pydantic models appropriately for data validation.",
