  "purpose": "Exporting classes and schemas related to a Textbelt SMS client for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .schema)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data processing or external communication occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export statements with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and schemas from internal modules and defines an export list. There are no data handling, network operations, or embedded logic that could be malicious. The code structure is standard for Python packages aiming to expose internal components. No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an access point for the classes and schemas related to a Textbelt client. Based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malware or security issues.",
