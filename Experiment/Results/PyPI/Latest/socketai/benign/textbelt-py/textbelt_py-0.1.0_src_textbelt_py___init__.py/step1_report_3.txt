  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a Python module related to SMS messaging, specifically importing classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client and .schema.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a simple import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are standard practices for module exports. It imports classes necessary for SMS functionality from local modules and makes them available for external use. No suspicious code, data handling, or network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module declaration with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not perform any operations beyond defining what symbols are exported.",
