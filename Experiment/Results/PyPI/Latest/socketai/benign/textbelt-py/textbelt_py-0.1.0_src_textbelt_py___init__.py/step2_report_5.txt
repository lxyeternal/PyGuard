  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data flows, external network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The reports correctly identify that these are standard module export declarations.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness:**\n   - The code appears syntactically correct and consistent across all reports.\n   - The imported classes (`TextbeltClient`, `SMSRequest`, etc.) are likely defined elsewhere; nothing in the snippet suggests they are malicious.\n   - No issues with the logic or structure.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns or security issues.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These seem appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify higher scores, and given the code's simplicity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**\n   - No malware activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any external communication, data handling, or execution of untrusted code.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely structural, serving as a module interface.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The scores should remain at zero, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Final note:**\n- Given the minimal and benign nature of this code, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard, safe, and contains no security issues.\n- Scores are appropriate as-is.\n- No further action needed.",
