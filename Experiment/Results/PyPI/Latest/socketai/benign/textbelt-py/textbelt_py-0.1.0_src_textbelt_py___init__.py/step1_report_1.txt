  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a text messaging client and related data schemas, likely part of a package for sending and receiving SMS messages.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from local modules: .client and .schema.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes (TextbeltClient, SMSRequest, SMSResponse, SMSStatusResponse) and then exports them, with no data flow beyond module imports/exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing solely on module exports. It imports classes from local modules and declares __all__ for public API exposure. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply re-exports classes from internal modules.",
