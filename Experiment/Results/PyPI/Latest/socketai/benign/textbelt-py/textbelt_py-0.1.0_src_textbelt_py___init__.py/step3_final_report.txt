  "purpose": "Module export setup for the package, exposing classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .schema).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py or module export file, importing classes and defining __all__ for public API. No logic, data processing, network activity, or external input/output is present. The code is minimal, syntactically correct, and typical for Python package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module export declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect that. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
