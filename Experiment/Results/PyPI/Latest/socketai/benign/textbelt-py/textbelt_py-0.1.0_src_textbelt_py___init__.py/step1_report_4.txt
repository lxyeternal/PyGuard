  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a Python package related to SMS messaging, specifically importing classes from local modules for client interactions and data schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client and .schema",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports and export definitions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ export list, which are standard for Python modules. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data processing operations. The code's structure indicates it serves as a module's __init__.py or similar setup file for package exports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
