{
  "purpose": "Defines public API exports for a text messaging package by importing classes and schemas related to SMS messaging functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'client' and 'schema' (relative imports). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems; code solely performs import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward import and export statements with no embedded logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module defining what classes and schemas are publicly available. It only imports specific classes and defines an export list. There are no operations, no input/output handling, and no code execution logic that could pose security concerns. The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up module exports with no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
