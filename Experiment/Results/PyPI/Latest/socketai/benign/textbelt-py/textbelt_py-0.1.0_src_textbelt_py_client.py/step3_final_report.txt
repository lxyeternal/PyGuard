  "purpose": "A client library for interacting with the Textbelt SMS API, including sending messages, webhook verification, and status checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in methods (phone, message, webhook URL, text ID), HTTP response data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST/GET requests, JSON responses, HMAC signature verification.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request payloads; responses are parsed and returned; webhook verification compares signatures and timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'timedelta.seconds' for timestamp validation, which only provides seconds component, leading to potential inaccuracies in expiration check.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with proper use of requests, HMAC, and JSON parsing. The main concern is the timestamp validation bug using 'timedelta.seconds' instead of 'total_seconds()', which can cause incorrect expiration validation of webhooks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The bug is a minor logic flaw, not malicious, but should be fixed for correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client with a minor timestamp validation bug. No malware or malicious intent detected. The security risk is low but should be addressed to ensure proper webhook validation.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
