{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client for the Textbelt API, enabling sending SMS messages, verifying webhooks, and checking delivery status.",
  "sources": "Reads API key during initialization, reads SMS request parameters, webhook headers (timestamp, signature), and raw JSON payload for webhooks.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST/GET requests to Textbelt API endpoints, uses hmac for webhook verification, and parses JSON responses.",
  "flows": "API key and SMS request data flow from method inputs to HTTP request payloads; webhook verification compares signatures and timestamps; responses are parsed and returned as objects.",
  "anomalies": "Webhook timestamp comparison uses timedelta.seconds, which may cause incorrect expiration check due to ignoring minutes over 60; no apparent hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscation or malicious payload handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation with proper use of requests, retries, and HMAC verification for webhooks. The webhook verification correctly checks timestamp freshness and signature validity. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling identified. Potential issue in time comparison logic (using timedelta.seconds) could lead to improper validation, but this is more of a bug than malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for Textbelt with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles standard API interactions and webhook verification securely. Minor bug in timestamp validation logic but not malicious. Overall, low risk and no malware detected.",
