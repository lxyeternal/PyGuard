{
  "purpose": "Exports user-owned files from Google Drive to a local directory, handling authentication and folder structure.",
  "sources": "Reads token.json, credentials.json, and Google Drive API responses for file metadata and media content.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded files to local disk; updates token.json with new credentials.",
  "flows": "Authenticates via OAuth, retrieves file list, builds folder paths, downloads files, and saves them locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments detected. User prompt for overwriting directories is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Google API libraries for OAuth and file operations. It performs legitimate actions: authenticating, listing files, creating directories, and downloading content. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network anomalies. Error handling is appropriate for API errors. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security considerations are typical for such tools, with no evident vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate, benign Google Drive data export utility. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to OAuth handling and file system operations, which are standard for such applications.",
