{
  "purpose": "The script exports files from a user's Google Drive account to a specified local directory, authenticating via OAuth2 and downloading all owned files.",
  "sources": "User input: command-line argument for output directory; Files retrieved via Google Drive API; OAuth2 token and credentials files; User confirmation input when directory exists.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded files to disk; Saving OAuth token to disk; Potentially reading OAuth credentials from disk.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> run() -> GDriveExport() -> _get_files() -> _get_folder_path() -> _map_files() -> _download_file() -> write files to disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; No obfuscated code or unusual language features; User confirmation prompt for overwriting existing directory; No suspicious network connections or data leaks; Proper use of API libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code properly implements Google Drive data export functionality with OAuth2 authentication, file retrieval, and download logic. Authentication credentials are loaded from files, not embedded secrets. The download process handles media requests securely. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. The only user interaction is for directory overwrite confirmation. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are observed. The script adheres to standard practices for API usage and file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and designed solely for exporting Google Drive data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It does not contain any obfuscated code or malware indicators. The overall security risk is minimal, assuming the environment and credentials files are secure.",
