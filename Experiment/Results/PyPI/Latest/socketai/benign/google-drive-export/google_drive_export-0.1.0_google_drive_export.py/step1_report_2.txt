{
  "purpose": "The script exports files from a user's Google Drive account to a local directory, handling authentication and file download automation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for credentials and tokens, user input for overwriting directories, and makes API requests to Google Drive to list and download files.",
  "sinks": "Writes files to the local filesystem, creates directories, and overwrites existing files. It also outputs progress and size information to the console.",
  "flows": "Authorization credentials are read or generated, then API requests are made to list and retrieve files. Files are downloaded through media requests, and directory paths are constructed via parent folder lookups. User input can influence directory overwriting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; uses standard OAuth token handling. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious API endpoints. No data exfiltration or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate file export operations using Google's API, with standard authentication flows. The directory and file handling are straightforward. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The only minor concern could be the prompting for directory overwrite, which is user-controlled. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign Google Drive export utility.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate Google Drive data export tool with no detectable malicious intent or malware. It operates within expected parameters for such an application, handling authentication, listing, and downloading files securely. No malicious code or supply chain threats are identified.",
