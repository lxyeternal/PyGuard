  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Authenticates with Google Drive via OAuth2.\n- Retrieves all user-owned files (excluding folders).\n- Builds directory structure based on folder hierarchy.\n- Downloads each file, handling errors for non-downloadable files.\n- Saves files locally, overwriting existing directories if confirmed.\n- Calculates total size of downloaded files.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- Uses standard Google API libraries.\n- User prompts for overwriting directories.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to perform legitimate file export operations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The logic and flow are straightforward and align with standard practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious API calls.\n- User input for overwriting is a typical UX choice, not malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- Minor: The script overwrites `token.json` without verifying its integrity, but this is standard for OAuth workflows.\n- No input validation on user prompts (but acceptable in context).\n- The code could benefit from exception handling for file system operations, but this doesn't impact security.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low, as it involves OAuth and file operations, but no real risk)\n- **Risk score:** Given the above, a score of **0.1** seems appropriate; no major security concerns.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All reports assume the code is for legitimate data export.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment, emphasizing the code's legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate Google Drive data export utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to OAuth handling and file system operations, which are typical for such tools.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are aligned, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
