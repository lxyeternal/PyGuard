{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest-based test suite verifying the instantiation of an MCP object, registration of specific tools, and the presence of an environment variable for the Twitter API key.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'TWITTER_API_KEY' and inspects the 'mcp' object and its registered tools.",
  "sinks": "There are no data leaks, network transmissions, or untrusted data flows; the code only performs assertions and environment checks.",
  "flows": "The environment variable check influences test execution; object type assertions verify internal states; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard testing procedures: verifying object instantiation, tool registration, and environment variable presence. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The environment variable check is a common practice for API key validation. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and a minimal security risk score. The confidence in these assessments is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated elements. The existing scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
