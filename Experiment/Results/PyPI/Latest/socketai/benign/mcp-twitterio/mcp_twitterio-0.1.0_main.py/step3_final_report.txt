  "purpose": "Provides an MCP server exposing various Twitter API interaction tools, including user info, tweets, followers, and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API key; user input parameters for API requests; external API responses.",
  "sinks": "API requests to external Twitter API endpoints; response handling returning JSON data.",
  "flows": "User input parameters -> API request URL/query parameters -> external Twitter API -> response -> return JSON data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard environment variable handling and API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of an asynchronous API client wrapped in an MCP server. It loads environment variables securely, performs standard API calls with proper error handling, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of environment variables for API keys aligns with best practices, and the code's logic is clear and predictable. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented Twitter API client exposed via an MCP server. It poses no security threat or malware risk based on the provided source code and analysis.",
