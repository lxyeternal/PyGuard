{
  "purpose": "The code implements a set of tools for interacting with the Twitter API via an MCP server, including fetching user info, tweets, followers, and performing searches.",
  "sources": "Environment variable TWITTER_API_KEY for API key; user input parameters such as userName, userId, tweetId, query, listId, etc.; API request URLs and parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to the Twitter API endpoints; response handling via response.json().",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct API request URLs and parameters, sent via HTTP GET requests; responses are processed and returned as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors. The API key is retrieved from environment variables. No malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables securely and uses them for API key management, avoiding hardcoded secrets. HTTP requests are made with user-provided parameters, but all inputs are used in a standard API context without modification or malicious injection points. The code performs straightforward API calls with appropriate error handling (response.raise_for_status()) and logging. There are no signs of malware activities such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The only potential concern is reliance on external API key and environment variable configuration, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Twitter API client exposed via an MCP server, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles API keys, performs expected API calls, and contains no hidden or malicious logic.",
