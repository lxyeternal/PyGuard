  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, likely related to Twitter API MCP service.",
  "sources": "The script imports setuptools and reads no external input; it does not fetch or process untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could cause data leaks or security issues are present; it only calls a setup function.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the script merely invokes a setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal, standard, and does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with a simple setup call that specifies a module named 'main'. It does not include any malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious logic. It is typical for Python package setup scripts and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
