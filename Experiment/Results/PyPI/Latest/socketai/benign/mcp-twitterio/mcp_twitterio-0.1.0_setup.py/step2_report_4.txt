  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup script using setuptools.\n- It only imports setuptools and calls `setuptools.setup()` with a `py_modules` argument.\n- No external data sources, user input, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The 'main' module is specified, but nothing indicates malicious intent within this script.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the script is a typical setup script with no security risks.\n   - No false positives or overstatements are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk: all assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is simple, static, and standard.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with a risk score of 0.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; they are consistent with the code.\n\n6. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify this. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign and standard.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
