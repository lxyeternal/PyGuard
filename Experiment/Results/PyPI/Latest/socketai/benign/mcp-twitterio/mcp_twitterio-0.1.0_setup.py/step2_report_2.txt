  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward, minimal setup script using setuptools.\n- No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only potential concern is the module named 'main', which could contain malicious code if it were untrusted, but the setup script itself does not execute or reference it directly beyond including it in the package configuration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or behavior:**\n   - The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n   - The 'malware' score of 0 across all reports aligns with this assessment.\n   - The 'obfuscated' score of 0 is justified; no obfuscation is present.\n\n2. **Risks associated with the 'main' module:**\n   - While the setup script references a module named 'main', it does not execute or import it during setup.\n   - The risk depends on the content of 'main', which is outside the scope of this script.\n   - Since the reports focus solely on the setup script, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior in this code, the risk remains negligible.\n\n3. **Score justification:**\n   - All reports assign a 'securityRisk' of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - The 'malware' score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The 'obfuscated' score is 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n\n4. **Potential improvements:**\n   - If there is concern about the 'main' module, further analysis should be performed on its contents.\n   - The current analysis is correct for the setup script itself.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks based on the provided code. Any potential risk hinges on the contents of the 'main' module, which is not examined here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code analysis.",
