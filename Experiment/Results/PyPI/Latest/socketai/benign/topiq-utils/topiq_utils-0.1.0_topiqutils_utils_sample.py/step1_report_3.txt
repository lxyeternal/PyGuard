  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.",
  "sources": "Function arguments a and b, which are inputs to each operation.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the result of the operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments (sources) directly to return statements (sinks) through arithmetic operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic arithmetic functions with straightforward logic. No external inputs are processed beyond function parameters, and no side effects or data leaks are evident. The division function handles division by zero safely. The code is simple, clean, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic arithmetic operations with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack vectors, or security issues. It appears safe and purposefully straightforward.",
