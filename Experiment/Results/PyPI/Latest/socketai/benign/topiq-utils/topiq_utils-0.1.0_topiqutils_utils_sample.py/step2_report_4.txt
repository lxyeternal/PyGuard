  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is straightforward arithmetic functions with standard error handling for division by zero.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is benign, with no external data flows, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - There are no indications of code anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, simple, and free from malicious intent.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified given the benign code.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score; the code is a standard utility module.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and rely on observable code analysis.\n   - Their conclusions are justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and thoroughness of the reports, and considering the code's simplicity, I concur with the assigned scores. There are no indicators of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code appears safe and benign.",
