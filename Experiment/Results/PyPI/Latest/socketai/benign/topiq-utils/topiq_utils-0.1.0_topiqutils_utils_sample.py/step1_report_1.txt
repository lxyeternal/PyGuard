  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in each function.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the computed results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in computations and results are returned; no external data flow or output beyond return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no unusual language features or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward arithmetic functions with basic error handling for division by zero. There are no external data sources, network calls, or data leaks. The functions are isolated and perform standard operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of arithmetic functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
