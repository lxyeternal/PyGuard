  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for each function.",
  "sinks": "Return statements; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into arithmetic operations and are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward arithmetic functions with input validation for division by zero. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious side effects. Usage is limited to mathematical calculations without external data interaction or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple, benign arithmetic operations with appropriate handling for division by zero. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
