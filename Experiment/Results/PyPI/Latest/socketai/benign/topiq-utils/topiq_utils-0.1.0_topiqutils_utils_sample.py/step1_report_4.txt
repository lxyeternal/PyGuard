  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) functions",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for each function",
  "sinks": "Return statements with computed results; no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into arithmetic operations and then return the results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual constructs or backdoors; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple arithmetic functions with basic input parameters and return statements. No external data sources, no user inputs, nor external communication or file operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The division function correctly handles division by zero, but this is standard error handling. Overall, the code appears benign, serving only mathematical purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of basic arithmetic functions with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a standard utility module.",
