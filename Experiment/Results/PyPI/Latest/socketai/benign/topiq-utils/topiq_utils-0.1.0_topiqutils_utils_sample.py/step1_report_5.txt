  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b for each function call.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the result of arithmetic operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are processed within each function and then returned as output (sink). No external data sources or outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, and no external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward arithmetic functions with proper input validation for division by zero. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are simple and self-contained. No external dependencies or side effects are present. The code appears to serve a basic computational purpose without any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic arithmetic operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It is clean, well-structured, and free from malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
