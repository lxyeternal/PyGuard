  "purpose": "Provides basic arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with standard error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b for each function.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return computed values directly without external data or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into arithmetic operations; no external data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper division by zero handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple arithmetic functions with standard validation. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions are clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and proper handling of division by zero confirm its safety. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or risk considerations are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
