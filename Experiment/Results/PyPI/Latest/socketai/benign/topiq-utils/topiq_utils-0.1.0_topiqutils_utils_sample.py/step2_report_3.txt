  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward implementation of basic arithmetic functions.\n   - All reports confirm the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code handles division by zero appropriately.\n\n   **Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious elements in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their analysis, emphasizing the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reports uniformly assign a confidence score of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Issues:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - Since the code is benign, no higher risk scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they focus on the observed code behavior.\n   - The analysis is consistent and based on actual code inspection.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and match the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the current scores.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless new information emerges.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, secure, and benign set of arithmetic functions with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed based on current information.",
