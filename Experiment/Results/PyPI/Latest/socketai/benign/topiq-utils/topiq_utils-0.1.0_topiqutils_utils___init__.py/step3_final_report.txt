  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() functions, hardcoded secrets, network activity, environment variables, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Source functions (eval/exec, network code) leading to potential data exfiltration or system modification points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical malicious indicators such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious network activity, which suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware 0.65, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.75) are consistent with these behaviors. Benign code snippets show no suspicious patterns, justifying zero scores. The confidence levels reflect the certainty based on the evidence described. Overall, the analysis aligns with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains significant indicators of malicious behavior, including dynamic execution and network activity, warranting high malware and risk scores. Benign code shows no such indicators. The current scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with Report 3 being the most concerning. No adjustments are necessary.",
