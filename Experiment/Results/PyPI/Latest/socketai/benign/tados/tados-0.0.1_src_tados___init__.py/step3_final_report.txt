{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'tados_stopwatch' module, likely for timing or stopwatch functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'tados_stopwatch' module from the environment or package repository.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import; there are no further flows as no functions or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'tados_stopwatch' is unusual and not a standard library, which warrants source verification but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is benign. The module's non-standard name raises a minor concern about trustworthiness, but no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal context. No active threats or malicious code are detected, and the import alone does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with the primary recommendation being to verify the source of the 'tados_stopwatch' module before further use. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
