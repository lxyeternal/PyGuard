{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'tados_stopwatch', likely used for timing or stopwatch functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates that data may be read from the 'tados_stopwatch' module during execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any functions within 'tados_stopwatch' that could handle untrusted data or perform critical actions, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to any subsequent code that uses it; however, this snippet only shows the import statement without further execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'tados_stopwatch' is uncommon and could be suspicious if it is obscure or unfamiliar, but based solely on this line, no malicious behavior is apparent. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'tados_stopwatch'. No executable code, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. Importing a module by itself is standard practice, and without additional context, it does not indicate malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, simply importing a module likely related to stopwatch functionality. Without additional code, further analysis cannot identify malicious intent.",
