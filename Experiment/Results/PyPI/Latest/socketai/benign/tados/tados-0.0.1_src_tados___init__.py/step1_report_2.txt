{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'tados_stopwatch', likely for timing or stopwatch functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'tados_stopwatch' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports a module and does not perform any data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; no source-to-sink paths are present as no further code is provided.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming convention for the module ('tados_stopwatch') which is not a standard library; potential for malicious or suspicious module, but no code execution or malicious actions are present in the import statement alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for 'tados_stopwatch'. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other actions. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent; however, the module name is non-standard and could be suspicious if untrusted. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet only performs a benign import of a potentially custom or third-party module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this single statement.",
