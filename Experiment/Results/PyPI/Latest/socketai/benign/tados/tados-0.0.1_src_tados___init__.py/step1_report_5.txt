{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'tados_stopwatch' and aliases it as 'stopwatch'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module 'tados_stopwatch'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process or output any data beyond the import.",
  "flows": "N/A; only an import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an uncommon module name 'tados_stopwatch' which could be an obfuscated or intentionally misleading name; no other code to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module named 'tados_stopwatch' and assigns it the alias 'stopwatch'. There are no further operations, data handling, or function calls. The module name appears unusual but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or data flows are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and appears benign, although the module name could warrant further review if the full code or package context is considered.",
