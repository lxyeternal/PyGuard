  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the clean method; UTFValidator.validate_input; is_utf_character function.",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal method, which logs the original and cleaned text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> validation -> filtering (either multiprocessing or character filtering) -> logging -> output cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no evidence of code injection or obfuscation. The code relies on imported modules for core operations, which are not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of input, filtering of non-UTF characters, and logging. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of imported modules suggests modular design; without their source, no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet. The flow is straightforward and does not involve any insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for UTF cleaning, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The design is standard for such utilities and does not include suspicious behaviors.",
