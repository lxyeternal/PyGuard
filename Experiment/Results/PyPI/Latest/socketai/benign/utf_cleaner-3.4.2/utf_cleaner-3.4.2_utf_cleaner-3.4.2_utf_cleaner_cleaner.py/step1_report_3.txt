  "purpose": "A utility class to clean strings by removing non-UTF characters, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the 'clean' method, and external modules: UTFValidator.validate_input, is_utf_character, UTFMultiprocessingHandler.filter_with_multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "UTFValidator.validate_input (validates input), is_utf_character (filters characters), UTFLogger.log_removal (logs data).",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is validated; depending on 'use_multiprocessing', text is processed via multiprocessing handler or generator filtering; final cleaned text is logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of multiprocessing is optional, and logging appears standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to remove non-UTF characters, using external validators, utilities, and loggers. It validates input, conditionally uses multiprocessing for filtering, and logs the removal process. No obfuscated or suspicious code is present. External modules are assumed standard, and the flow appears straightforward and intended for data sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for cleaning UTF characters with proper validation and logging. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
