  "purpose": "Utility for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input parameter, validation function, utility function for character check, external multiprocessing handler.",
  "sinks": "Logging method that records original and cleaned text.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation → filtering (via utility or multiprocessing) → logging → return cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward input validation, character filtering, and logging. External modules are assumed standard and benign. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Logging potentially sensitive data is a privacy concern but not malicious. The optional multiprocessing adds complexity but is implemented safely. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cleaning non-UTF characters with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are justified primarily due to privacy considerations in logging, but overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
