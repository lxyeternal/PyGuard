{
  "purpose": "A utility class for removing non-UTF characters from input text, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in the clean() method, and calls to UTFValidator.validate_input() and is_utf_character() functions.",
  "sinks": "UTFValidator.validate_input() and is_utf_character() functions, as well as logging via UTFLogger.log_removal().",
  "flows": "Input text flows into validate_input(), then into either filter_with_multiprocessing() or character filtering loop, then logs are created, and cleaned text is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; external functions are called but their implementations are not provided, which is standard for modular code. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for cleaning non-UTF characters, validating input before processing, optionally using multiprocessing for efficiency, and logging the removal process. All external functions appear to serve standard utility purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears to be a straightforward utility with proper validation and logging, without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard text cleaning function with input validation and optional multiprocessing. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is detected. The implementation appears safe and intended for data sanitization.",
