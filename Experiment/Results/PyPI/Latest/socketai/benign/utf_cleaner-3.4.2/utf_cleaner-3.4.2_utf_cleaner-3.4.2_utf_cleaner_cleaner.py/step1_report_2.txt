  "purpose": "A class to clean strings by removing non-UTF characters, with optional multiprocessing support.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the 'clean' method, validated by UTFValidator.validate_input.",
  "sinks": "UTFLogger.log_removal logs the original and cleaned text, potentially exposing data through logs.",
  "flows": "Input text -> validated by UTFValidator -> optionally processed with UTFMultiprocessingHandler or character filtering -> logged by UTFLogger -> output cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, string processing to remove non-UTF characters, and logs the operation. It uses modular imports for validation, logging, utilities, and multiprocessing handling. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident. The logging of original and cleaned text could raise privacy concerns, but it is not inherently malicious. The use of multiprocessing is optional and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for cleaning UTF strings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard validation, processing, and logging practices without suspicious behaviors.",
