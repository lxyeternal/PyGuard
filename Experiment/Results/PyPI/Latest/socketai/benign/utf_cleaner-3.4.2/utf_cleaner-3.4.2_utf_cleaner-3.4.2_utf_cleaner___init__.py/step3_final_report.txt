{
  "purpose": "Unconditionally installs a Python package from a remote GitHub URL during runtime and imports it, potentially executing malicious code from an untrusted source.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'pip install' from a GitHub URL, reading environment variables indirectly via import, and the silent error handling mask failures.",
  "sinks": "The import of the 'gits' module after installation, which could execute code during import if malicious, and the potential for code injection or malicious payloads during remote installation.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess call to install from GitHub -> sink: import of 'gits' module which executes code during import.",
  "anomalies": "Silent suppression of all errors with 'try: ... except: pass', unverified remote code execution, and immediate import after installation without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically installs a package from an external GitHub repository, which can contain malicious code. The silent error handling masks failures, increasing risk. Importing the package immediately after installation can execute malicious payloads if the repository is compromised. The code is straightforward but risky due to supply chain concerns. The pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks, especially when the source is untrusted. The code does not obfuscate or hide its intent, but the behavior itself is high risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a high security risk due to remote code execution from an untrusted source, with silent error masking and immediate import, which could execute malicious payloads. The malware score should be set high, and the overall security risk is significant.",
