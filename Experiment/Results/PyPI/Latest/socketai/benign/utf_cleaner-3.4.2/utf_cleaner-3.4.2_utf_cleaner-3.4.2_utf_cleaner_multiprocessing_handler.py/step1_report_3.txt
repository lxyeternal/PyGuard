{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to filter non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "Input text parameter in filter_with_multiprocessing method",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes data to external systems or outputs untrusted data without sanitization",
  "flows": "Input text -> divides into chunks -> processes chunks in parallel -> joins filtered chunks into output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed; the code uses multiprocessing for text processing",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard multiprocessing modules and a local utility is_utf_character. It defines a helper function _filter_chunk that filters non-UTF characters. The class UTFMultiprocessingHandler provides a static method to process large text by dividing it into chunks based on CPU count, then uses multiprocessing Pool to filter each chunk in parallel, finally combining results. No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code performs a benign text filtering task efficiently using multiprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign utility for filtering non-UTF characters from text using multiprocessing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
