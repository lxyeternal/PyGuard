{
  "purpose": "The code filters non-UTF characters from a given text using multiprocessing to improve performance.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' passed to the method 'filter_with_multiprocessing'.",
  "sinks": "The final concatenated string returned by 'filter_with_multiprocessing'.",
  "flows": "Text is divided into chunks, processed in parallel by '_filter_chunk', and then combined back into a single string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The use of multiprocessing for text filtering is standard. The function 'is_utf_character' is imported but not shown; assuming it performs a standard check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiprocessing tools and uses a helper function to filter out non-UTF characters. It divides the input text into chunks based on CPU count and processes these chunks in parallel to improve efficiency. The processing involves filtering each character with 'is_utf_character'. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification, are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for text sanitization, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign task of filtering non-UTF characters from text using multiprocessing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
