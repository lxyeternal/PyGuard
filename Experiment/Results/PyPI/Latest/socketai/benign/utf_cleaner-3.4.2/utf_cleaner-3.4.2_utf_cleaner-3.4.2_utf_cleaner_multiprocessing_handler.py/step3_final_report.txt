  "purpose": "Filter non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input text divided into chunks based on CPU count.",
  "sinks": "Filtered text output; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> chunking -> _filter_chunk (via is_utf_character) -> filtered chunks -> join -> output text.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward multiprocessing and filtering logic.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks according to CPU count, processes each chunk with _filter_chunk which filters out non-UTF characters based on is_utf_character, and then joins the filtered chunks. No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The external utility is assumed benign. The multiprocessing use is standard and does not introduce security issues. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filtering non-UTF characters, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are accurate and appropriate.",
