{
  "purpose": "To efficiently filter non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in filter_with_multiprocessing method, and the _filter_chunk function processing chunks of the text.",
  "sinks": "The return statement which outputs the filtered text, combining chunks after processing.",
  "flows": "The text is divided into chunks; each chunk is processed by _filter_chunk via multiprocessing Pool; filtered chunks are combined into the final string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code relies on external utility is_utf_character, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, processes chunks in parallel to filter out non-UTF characters, and then recombines the filtered chunks. It uses standard multiprocessing without any hidden or malicious operations. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or credential mishandling are present. The code appears to be a straightforward text filtering utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filtering non-UTF characters using multiprocessing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply performs text processing efficiently.",
