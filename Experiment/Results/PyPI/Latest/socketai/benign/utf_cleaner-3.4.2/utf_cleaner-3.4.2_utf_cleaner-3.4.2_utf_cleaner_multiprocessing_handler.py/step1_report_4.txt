  "purpose": "The code aims to filter non-UTF characters from a text using multiprocessing to enhance performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from the parameter 'text' in filter_with_multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Returns a filtered string; no external data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> divided into chunks -> processed in parallel by _filter_chunk -> concatenated back into a string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, uses a multiprocessing Pool to process each chunk with _filter_chunk, which filters out non-UTF characters using is_utf_character. The code structure appears straightforward and intended for performance optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The imported 'is_utf_character' function's implementation is unknown, but its usage seems benign in this context. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard multiprocessing implementation for text filtering with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a benign purpose with proper structure and no anomalies.",
