  "purpose": "To filter non-UTF characters from a text string using multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Reading input text (parameter 'text') and dividing it into chunks for processing.",
  "sinks": "Returning the concatenated filtered string; no untrusted data output or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> Chunking -> Multiprocessing pool processing each chunk with '_filter_chunk' -> Concatenation of results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiprocessing with shared data; the function 'is_utf_character' imported from a relative module may warrant review but appears to be a utility function. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function '_filter_chunk' that filters out non-UTF characters from a text chunk, using an imported 'is_utf_character' function. The class 'UTFMultiprocessingHandler' provides a static method 'filter_with_multiprocessing' that divides input text into chunks based on CPU count, then processes these chunks in parallel via a multiprocessing pool. The process is straightforward, primarily aimed at efficient text filtering. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation. The only notable aspect is the use of multiprocessing for performance enhancement, which is a legitimate pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filtering UTF characters in a text, utilizing multiprocessing for performance. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks present. The design appears typical for such utility functions, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
