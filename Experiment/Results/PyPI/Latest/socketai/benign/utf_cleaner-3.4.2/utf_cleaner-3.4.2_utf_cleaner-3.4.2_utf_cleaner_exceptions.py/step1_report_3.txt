  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for UTF cleaning error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and standard; no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from the built-in Exception class. 'UTFCleaningError' serves as a base for related exceptions, and 'InvalidInputError' is a specific subclass used to indicate invalid input types. There are no functions, no data processing, or external interactions. The code structure is simple, standard, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
