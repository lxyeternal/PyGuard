  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception class definitions do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are used solely for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions; no unusual patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's base Exception class. The first class is a generic UTF cleaning error, and the second extends it to specify invalid input errors with a default message. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or external calls. The code does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Overall, this is standard exception class definition with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no malicious activities, suspicious behaviors, or security risks present.",
