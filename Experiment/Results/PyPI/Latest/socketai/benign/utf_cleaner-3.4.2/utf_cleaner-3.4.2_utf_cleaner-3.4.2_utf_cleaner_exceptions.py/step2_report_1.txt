  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines two custom exception classes:\n  - `UTFCleaningError` (base class)\n  - `InvalidInputError` (inherits from `UTFCleaningError`, with a default message)\n- The code is straightforward, with no functions, data processing, external data, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for exceptions, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and acknowledge the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports give 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n### Risk and Malware Justification:\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes, the risk score should be **0**.\n- Malware score is **0** because there is no malicious behavior or payload.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious intent, as the code is standard class definitions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no obfuscation, malware, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No further action needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis is thorough and correct.",
