  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only class definitions and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-output flow present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions without any suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with clear and simple structure. There are no data inputs, no external interactions, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for exception handling. No signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to UTF cleaning errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
