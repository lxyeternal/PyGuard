  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's harmless nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they logically conclude the code is safe based on its content.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - They accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
