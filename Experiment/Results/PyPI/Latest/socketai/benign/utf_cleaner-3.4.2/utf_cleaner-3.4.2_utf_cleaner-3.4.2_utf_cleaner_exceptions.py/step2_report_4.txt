  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions, inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no functions, data processing, input/output handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:  \nThe reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no malicious constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Given the simplicity of the code, this assessment is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Correct, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Malware score (0)**: Correct, no malware activity or malicious intent evident.  \n- **Security risk score (0)**: Correct, the code is benign and purely for error handling.\n\n4. **Potential for Hidden Risks**:  \nThere is no indication of hidden malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code is static, simple class definitions with no dynamic or external components.\n\n5. **Consistency & Justification**:  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessment, giving a confidence of 1, and correctly noting the absence of risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score**: **0** (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Note on scoring higher than 0.5**: Since there is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues, a higher score isn't justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My overall estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's simplicity.",
