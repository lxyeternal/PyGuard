  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes with no data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- **Confidence**: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk**: All assign 0, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions or malicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports' zero scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nThe malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate. There's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.**",
