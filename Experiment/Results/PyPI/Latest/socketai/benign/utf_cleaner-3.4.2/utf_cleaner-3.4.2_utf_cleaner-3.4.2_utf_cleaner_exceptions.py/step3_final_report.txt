  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two exception class definitions: 'UTFCleaningError' and 'InvalidInputError'. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static, simple, and standard for error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes do not contain any code that could be exploited or cause security issues. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
