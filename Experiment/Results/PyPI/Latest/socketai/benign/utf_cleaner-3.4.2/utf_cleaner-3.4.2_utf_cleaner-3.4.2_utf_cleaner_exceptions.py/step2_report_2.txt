  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining two custom exception classes: `UTFCleaningError` and `InvalidInputError`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n- No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The consensus is that the code is benign, serving solely as error handling mechanisms.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports.\n- Obfuscated is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- Security risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Assessment of the scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no discrepancies or unreasonable scores are apparent.\n- Since the code is only class definitions for exceptions, there’s no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reasoning dismisses any assumptions of malicious intent, which is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current scores seem reasonable and justified.\n- The detailed analysis supports that the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
