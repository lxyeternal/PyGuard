  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling UTF cleaning errors and invalid input errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points; the code only defines classes and does not perform data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not include input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'UTFCleaningError' and a derived class 'InvalidInputError' for specific error handling related to UTF cleaning and input validation. Both classes are standard Python exception classes with no additional logic or data processing. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or behaviors. The code appears to serve purely as error handling mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply creates custom exceptions for use elsewhere in an application.",
