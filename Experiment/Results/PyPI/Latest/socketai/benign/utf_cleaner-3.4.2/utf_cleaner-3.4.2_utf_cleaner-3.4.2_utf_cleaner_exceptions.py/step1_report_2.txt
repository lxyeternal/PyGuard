  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for UTF cleaning errors and invalid input handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'UTFCleaningError' and a derived class 'InvalidInputError' for specific error handling. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and serves as error definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
