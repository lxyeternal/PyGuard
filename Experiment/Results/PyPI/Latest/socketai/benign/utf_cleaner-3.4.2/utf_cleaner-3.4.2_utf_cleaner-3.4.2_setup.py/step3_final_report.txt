  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'utf-cleaner' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, description, author, author_email, url; dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, containing only static metadata and dependency declarations. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard packaging practices support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
