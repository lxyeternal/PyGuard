  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- The code only defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Confirming the code:**\n- The provided code matches the description in each report.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The code is static and straightforward.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the 'author_email' and 'url' fields, which contain standard metadata. There's no indication these are malicious or sensitive beyond normal package info.\n- No signs of code injection, external data processing, or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Any discrepancies or suggestions:**\n- None. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and comprehensive.**",
