  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'utf-cleaner' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Input source is the setup() function call with static string parameters, package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code consists of standard setup configuration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and compatibility requirements. All elements are static and typical for package distribution. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for publishing a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
