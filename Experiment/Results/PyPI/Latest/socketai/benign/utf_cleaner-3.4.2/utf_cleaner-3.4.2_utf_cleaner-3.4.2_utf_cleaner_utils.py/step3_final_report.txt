  "purpose": "Checks if a character is a valid UTF-8 character by attempting to encode it in UTF-8 and catching encoding errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' (the character to validate).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the function only processes input locally without external data or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' is encoded; success leads to returning True, failure (exception) leads to False.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward encoding attempt with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to encode the input character in UTF-8. If encoding succeeds, it confirms the character is valid UTF-8; if a UnicodeEncodeError occurs, it indicates invalidity. The code is simple, uses standard Python methods, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The function does not perform network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The exception handling is appropriate for validation. No issues or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for UTF-8 validation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
