  "purpose": "Check if a given character is a valid UTF-8 character.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'char' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The encode method on 'char' to validate UTF-8 encoding.",
  "flows": "Input 'char' → 'char.encode('utf-8')' → return value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code performs a simple validation.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to encode the input character as UTF-8. If encoding succeeds, it returns True; if a UnicodeEncodeError occurs, it returns False. The method used is standard for UTF-8 validation and does not include malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and serves a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple UTF-8 validation function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility function without any malicious intent.",
