  "purpose": "Validator for UTF-8 strings to ensure input is a string type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling beyond raising an exception.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is checked for type; if invalid, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation logic with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for UTF validation, with a static method that checks if 'text' is a string. If not, it raises a custom exception. There are no external data sources, no malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is simple and appears to serve a validation purpose without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic input validation without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility class.",
