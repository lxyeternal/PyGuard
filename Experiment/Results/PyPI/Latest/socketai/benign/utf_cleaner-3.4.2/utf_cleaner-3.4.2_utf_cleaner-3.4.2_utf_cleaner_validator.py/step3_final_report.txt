  "flows": "Input 'text' -> isinstance check -> raise InvalidInputError if check fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and performs a simple type check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom exception and defines a class with a static method that checks if the input is a string. If not, it raises an exception. There are no external data sources, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is simple and standard. The exception used is assumed to be a normal custom exception. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is clear, and it performs minimal validation without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic type check and raising an exception if validation fails. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
