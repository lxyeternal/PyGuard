  "purpose": "Validator class for checking if input strings are valid UTF-8 strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the validate_input method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises an exception if input is not a string; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from method parameter to type check, then possibly triggers exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a validator class with a static method that checks if the input 'text' is of type str. If not, it raises an 'InvalidInputError'. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, or suspicious operations. The class and method perform simple type validation with no complex logic or obfuscation. The import of 'InvalidInputError' appears to be standard, assuming it is a proper exception class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic input validation utility with no malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose and is free of suspicious activity.",
