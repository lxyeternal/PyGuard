  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and applying a critical security perspective.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Imports a custom exception `InvalidInputError`.\n- Defines a class `UTFValidator` with a static method `validate_input`.\n- The method checks if `text` is a string; if not, raises `InvalidInputError`.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or complex logic.\n- Very straightforward, minimalistic code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All describe the code as a simple input validator.\n- No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No network, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n- Consistent conclusion: benign, straightforward utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Presence of Issues\n- The code's logic is straightforward and matches the description.\n- No discrepancies between the code and reports.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.\n\n### Error, Flaw, or Mistake in the Reports\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as a basic validation utility.\n- No errors or flaws in the reasoning.\n\n### Score Justification and Recommendations\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code performs no malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0, justified given the simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Risk Score Consideration\n- Since the code only checks for type and raises an exception, the **risk score** should remain **0**.\n- No logic that could lead to security vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n### Additional Observations\n- The use of a custom exception `InvalidInputError` is standard.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.\n- The code does not process or handle actual UTF-8 validation beyond type checking; it only verifies that input is a string, not whether it is valid UTF-8.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious behavior present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is clear and straightforward.                                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky operations.                              |\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion\n- The code is a benign, minimal input validation utility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports.",
