  "purpose": "Validator class for checking if input strings are valid UTF-8 strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the validate_input method as the 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leak or effect are present; the code only performs validation and raises an exception.",
  "flows": "Input is passed to validate_input; if not a string, InvalidInputError is raised; otherwise, validation passes with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple validator class with a static method that checks if the provided input is a string. If not, it raises an InvalidInputError. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, and no flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions. The class is basic and appears to serve as an input validation utility. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple type check and raises an exception if validation fails. It does not contain malware or security risks. The implementation is minimal, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
