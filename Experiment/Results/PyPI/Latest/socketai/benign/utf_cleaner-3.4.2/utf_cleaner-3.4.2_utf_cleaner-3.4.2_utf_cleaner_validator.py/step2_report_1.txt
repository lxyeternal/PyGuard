  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward class with a static method that checks if the input 'text' is of type `str`. If not, it raises `InvalidInputError`.\n- There are no other operations, no external data sources, no network calls, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The import of `InvalidInputError` appears standard, assuming it is a proper exception class.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is simple and performs only type validation.\n- They note the absence of malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- No issues or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These seem appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code only performs a type check and raises an exception, and no malicious activity is present, a risk score higher than 0.5 isn't justified.\n- The code does not introduce security vulnerabilities; it is a benign utility.\n\n**Step 5: Examine malware score**\n\n- All reports assign malware score: 0.\n- This is correct, as there is no malicious activity or payload.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The assumption that the code is safe is justified; no hidden logic or malicious intent is apparent.\n- The custom exception `InvalidInputError` is standard and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency in scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward input validator.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or payload present                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation             |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected             |\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
