  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define a class for tracking removal of non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "logging.basicConfig() for configuring logging; log_removal method for input parameters 'original' and 'cleaned'.",
  "sinks": "logging.info() for outputting removal information.",
  "flows": "log_removal uses 'original' and 'cleaned' to determine removed characters, then logs info if any are found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; logging configuration and class are straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code configures logging at DEBUG level with timestamp, level, and message formatting. It defines a class UTFLogger with a static method to log the removal of non-UTF characters by comparing 'original' and 'cleaned' strings and logging the removed characters. The logic is simple, intended for tracking character filtering, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility designed to track character removal, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
