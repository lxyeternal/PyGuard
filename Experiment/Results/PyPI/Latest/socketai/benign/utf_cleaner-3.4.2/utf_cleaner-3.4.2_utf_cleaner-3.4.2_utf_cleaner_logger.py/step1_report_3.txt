{
  "purpose": "Provides a logging utility class for tracking removal of non-UTF characters from strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it operates on method parameters 'original' and 'cleaned'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the standard logging module to output info messages, which could be viewed or intercepted but not typically harmful.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the method processes input parameters and logs information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging configuration and a class with a static method for logging removed characters. The method compares two strings, finds the set difference, and logs the removed characters if any. There are no external data inputs, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors present. It appears to be a utility for tracking character removals, likely for validation or cleaning processes. No malware or security threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for logging character removals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
