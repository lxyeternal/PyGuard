  "purpose": "Logger for tracking character removals during text processing.",
  "sources": "The method compares 'original' and 'cleaned' strings to identify removed characters.",
  "sinks": "Logging.info outputs the list of removed characters; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are compared via set difference; differences are logged at INFO level.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging, defines a class with a static method that computes the set difference between 'original' and 'cleaned' strings to identify removed characters, and logs these characters. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The logic is correct for its purpose, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, utility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for logging character removals with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
