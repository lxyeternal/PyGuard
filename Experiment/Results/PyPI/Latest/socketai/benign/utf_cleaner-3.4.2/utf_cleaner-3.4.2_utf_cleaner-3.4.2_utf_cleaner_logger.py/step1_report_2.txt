{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a logger and defines a class for tracking character removals in text processing, specifically for logging the removal of non-UTF characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration for logging and input parameters for the static method log_removal (original, cleaned).",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the logging.info statement which outputs information about removed characters.",
  "flows": "Input strings (original and cleaned) are compared to identify removed characters, which are then logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed. The code's purpose appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging with DEBUG level and a timestamped format. It defines a class UTFLogger with a static method log_removal that calculates the difference between the sets of characters in the original and cleaned strings, and logs any removed characters. The logic is simple, non-malicious, and intended for tracking character filtering actions. No external data sources, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on logging character removal events for text processing. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security issues.",
