{
  "purpose": "To configure logging and define a logger class for tracking character removals, potentially for cleaning or filtering text data.",
  "sources": "Logging configuration and static method that takes 'original' and 'cleaned' string inputs to detect removed characters.",
  "sinks": "The log statement outputs information about removed characters; no other sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings 'original' and 'cleaned' flow into the log_removal method, which compares them and logs differences.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and uses standard logging practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic logging configuration at DEBUG level. It defines a class UTFLogger with a static method that compares two strings to identify characters removed from the original. It logs these removed characters at INFO level. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The logic appears to be intended for tracking character filtering or cleaning operations, possibly for sanitizing text data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility to log character removals during text processing. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
