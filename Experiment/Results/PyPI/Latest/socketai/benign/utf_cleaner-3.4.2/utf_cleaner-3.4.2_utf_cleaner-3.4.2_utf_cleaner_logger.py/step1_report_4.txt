{
  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define a class to log removal of non-UTF characters from strings.",
  "sources": "logging.basicConfig call, class UTFLogger, and its static method log_removal",
  "sinks": "The logging.info call which outputs information about removed characters",
  "flows": "log_removal method takes original and cleaned strings, identifies removed characters, and logs them",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward logging setup and class definition",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging at DEBUG level with a timestamped format, which is standard. It defines a UTFLogger class with a static method to log characters removed from a string. The method computes the set difference between original and cleaned strings and logs any characters that were removed. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be utility code for character filtering and logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for logging character removals, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
