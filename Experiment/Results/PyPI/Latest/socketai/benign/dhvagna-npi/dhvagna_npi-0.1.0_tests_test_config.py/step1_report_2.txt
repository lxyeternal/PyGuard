  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Config class in the dhvagna_npi package, validating default values, saving/loading configurations, folder creation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "os, json, tempfile, unittest, pathlib, Config class import",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No suspicious source-to-sink data flows observed; tests involve standard file and object operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code performs standard testing procedures without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines unittests for a configuration management class, utilizing temporary directories and file operations. It tests default parameter values, save/load functionality, directory creation, and error handling for invalid JSON. No code injection, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. All operations are standard for testing configuration persistence and error handling. No external or untrusted data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for the Config class, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It employs standard Python testing practices without any suspicious or malicious code elements.",
