  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Config class in the dhvagna_npi package.",
  "sources": "os, json, tempfile, unittest, Path, and the Config class from dhvagna_npi.config",
  "sinks": "File system operations (creating, reading, writing 'config.json' and directories)",
  "flows": "Config.save() writes to 'config.json'; Config.load() reads from it; tests manipulate the filesystem to verify behavior",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard unit testing practices for a configuration management class. It creates temporary directories, reads and writes configuration data to a JSON file, and verifies the behavior of the Config class. All file operations and data handling are typical for testing purposes. No code injections, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not include any external or hidden malicious actions, backdoors, or privacy violations. The file handling appears safe and intended for testing the Config class functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for configuration management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on the filesystem for testing and does not include any suspicious or harmful actions.",
