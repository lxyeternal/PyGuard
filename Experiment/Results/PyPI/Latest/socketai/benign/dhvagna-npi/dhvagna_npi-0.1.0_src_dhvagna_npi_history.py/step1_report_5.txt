  "purpose": "Manage and store transcription history, including saving transcriptions to files and retrieving recent or saved transcriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration object, reading and listing files from the transcription folder, reading file contents, obtaining current date and time.",
  "sinks": "Writing transcriptions to files, reading files for display or processing.",
  "flows": "Adding text -> Saving to a timestamped file if enabled -> Retrieving recent or saved files -> Reading file contents for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. File handling is straightforward; no evident malicious obfuscation or backdoors. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages transcription history with standard file operations and in-memory storage. It conditionally writes transcription data to files with timestamped filenames, and retrieves recent files sorted by modification time. Exception handling is broad but does not mask malicious activity; it simply ensures robustness. No network calls, system commands, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation for managing transcription logs.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs basic file I/O for storing and retrieving transcription data without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a typical utility class with no evident security issues or malware characteristics.",
