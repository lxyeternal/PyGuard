  "purpose": "Manage transcription history by storing, saving, and retrieving transcriptions and associated files.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration object properties, reads files from a directory, gets current date and time.",
  "sinks": "Writes transcriptions to files, reads files from disk.",
  "flows": "Input configuration -> Add transcriptions -> Save files if enabled -> Retrieve recent files or saved files from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; file handling is standard. No suspicious external network activity or obfuscated code. Exception handling is broad but standard for file I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages transcription history through in-memory storage and filesystem operations. It constructs filenames based on current timestamps and saves transcription data with timestamps. Retrieval functions access files, parse timestamps, and read content. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors. Exception handling is broad but typical for file I/O and does not conceal malicious activity. Usage of date/time functions, file reads/writes, and directory listing are standard and do not pose security risks. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward transcription history manager with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It securely handles file I/O, with standard exception handling and no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.",
