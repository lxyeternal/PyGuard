  "purpose": "Manage transcription history by storing, retrieving, and saving transcribed texts to files.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration object for save_transcriptions flag and folder path; reading and listing files in the transcription folder; reading content from transcription files.",
  "sinks": "Writing transcription data to files; reading files that could contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Adding transcriptions (from user input or external source) -> saving to files if enabled -> retrieving recent or saved transcriptions from files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious behavior. File handling appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code manages transcription history with standard file operations and in-memory storage. It safely handles file writing and reading with encoding specified. The use of timestamps for file names and reading file content does not show any malicious intent. Error handling is broad but not malicious. No network communication, data exfiltration, or secret handling detected. The only potential concern is that it reads and writes files based on external configuration, but this is typical for such modules and does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing transcription history with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard file I/O and in-memory data management safely. No malware or security threats are evident.",
