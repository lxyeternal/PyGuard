  "purpose": "Manage and store transcription history, including saving transcriptions to files and retrieving recent or saved transcriptions.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from the 'config' object; reads directory contents with os.listdir; reads and writes files with open; gets file modification times with os.path.getmtime.",
  "sinks": "Writes transcription data to files in a specified folder; reads files from the folder; retrieves modification times of files.",
  "flows": "Input: 'config' object and text input to 'add'; Flow: 'add' writes to file based on current timestamp; 'get_saved_transcriptions' reads files from the folder, extracts timestamps and contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. Use of dynamic filenames and reading arbitrary files from a directory is typical for such functionality. Exception handling is broad but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to handle transcription history with methods for adding entries, retrieving recent entries, and loading saved transcription files. It uses timestamps for naming files and extracting timestamps from file content. File operations depend on external 'config' parameters. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code does not perform network operations, reverse shells, or data exfiltration. No suspicious patterns or backdoors are present. Exception handling is broad but non-malicious. Overall, the code functions as expected for a transcription history module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing transcription history with file I/O operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It primarily reads from and writes to the filesystem based on configuration, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
