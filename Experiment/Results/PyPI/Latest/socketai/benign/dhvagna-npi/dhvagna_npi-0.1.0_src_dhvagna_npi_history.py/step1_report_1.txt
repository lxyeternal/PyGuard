  "purpose": "Manage transcription history by storing, saving, and retrieving voice transcriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration attributes, accessing the filesystem to list, read, and write transcription files.",
  "sinks": "Writing transcriptions to files, reading from files which could contain untrusted content.",
  "flows": "Input text added via add() method flows into storage and optional file writing; reading files flows into retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or unusual code patterns. Use of filename timestamp may be predictable but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code manages transcription history through in-memory storage and file operations. It writes transcriptions with timestamps to files and retrieves recent files, extracting timestamps and content. No external network connections or suspicious data handling observed. Error handling is broad but does not introduce malicious behavior. Files are read and written securely with UTF-8 encoding. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for managing transcription history with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It handles file I/O securely, with no suspicious behavior or malware signals.",
