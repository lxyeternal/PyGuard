  "purpose": "A command-line voice transcription tool for converting spoken audio into text in multiple languages.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config, .history, .core",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only module imports and metadata are defined",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules presumed to be part of the package's internal structure and defines version and author metadata. There are no external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input in this fragment. As a minimal entry point, it appears standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a basic module initializer and metadata holder for the voice transcription project. There are no malicious elements or security concerns detected within this fragment.",
