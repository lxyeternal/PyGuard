  "purpose": "A command-line voice transcription tool for converting spoken audio into text in multiple languages.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .config, .history, and .core",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communications within this snippet",
  "flows": "No specific data flow is observable from the provided code snippet; the main functions are imported but not executed here",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present in this fragment; the version and author info are benign",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily the module's header with import statements and metadata variables. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or external interactions. The imported modules could contain sensitive or malicious code, but based on this snippet alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard setup for a command-line tool, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign module header for a voice transcription tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
