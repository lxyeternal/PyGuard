  "purpose": "Module initialization for a voice transcription tool, importing internal components and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements of internal modules (.config, .history, .core); setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no external network or data flow in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. All imported modules are internal, and the snippet contains only metadata variables. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign, straightforward module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
