{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line user interface for a speech transcription application, including help, settings, history viewing, progress display, and result presentation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from user prompts (Prompt.ask, Confirm.ask), keyboard events (keyboard.read_event), and external utility functions (get_available_languages, get_language_codes, get_language_name).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input flows into configuration updates, language selection, and folder paths. No data is sent over network, written to sensitive files, or used in insecure SQL queries.",
  "flows": "User input via prompts and keyboard events influence configuration, display options, and navigation; these are used to update internal state but do not interact with external or untrusted sources beyond user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code patterns. The only external system call is to 'keyboard.read_event', which is typical for CLI hotkey detection and safe if properly managed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a UI module that relies on standard libraries (rich, keyboard) and utility functions for language info. It handles user input via prompts and keyboard events, displays information with rich, and modifies configuration data. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The use of 'keyboard' for hotkeys and 'rich' for UI is consistent with CLI apps. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical UI interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It only interacts with the user and configuration objects locally, with no external communication or risky operations detected.",
