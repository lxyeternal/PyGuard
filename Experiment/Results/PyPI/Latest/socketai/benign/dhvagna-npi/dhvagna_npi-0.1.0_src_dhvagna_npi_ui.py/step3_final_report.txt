  "purpose": "This code provides command-line UI components for a voice transcription application, including help display, settings management, history viewing, progress indication, header, controls, and result display.",
  "sources": "User inputs via keyboard.read_event(), Prompt.ask() for menu choices, configuration object properties, filesystem operations (os.makedirs), and utility functions for language data.",
  "sinks": "Display outputs via rich panels and tables, configuration modifications, directory creation, and progress bar updates.",
  "flows": "User input triggers configuration changes or filesystem operations; keyboard events control UI flow; display functions output to console based on user actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Directory creation based on user input could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is standard in CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (rich, keyboard, os) for UI and filesystem interactions. No network activity or malicious behavior is present. Input handling is typical, and filesystem operations are controlled. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The use of keyboard.read_event() is for capturing hotkeys, which is standard. Directory creation without validation is a minor concern but not malicious. Utility functions are presumed safe. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI UI module with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to filesystem operations. The assessments are consistent and justified; no further action is necessary.",
