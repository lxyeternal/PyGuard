{
  "purpose": "Provides user interface components and functions for a command-line voice transcription application, including help display, settings, history viewing, progress bar, header, controls, and result display.",
  "sources": "User inputs via Prompt and keyboard.read_event(), data read from configuration object and language utility functions, file system operations (os.makedirs), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "User inputs that modify configuration, file system modifications (creating directories), and display outputs to the console. No network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "User input prompts (sources) influence configuration updates or navigation decisions (sinks). The application reads language data, user choices, and filesystem state to determine behavior. Data is displayed on console outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of keyboard.read_event(suppress=True) is standard for capturing key events. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed. Use of os.makedirs without validation is standard but could be misused if inputs are malicious; however, in this context, it is a controlled directory creation.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements UI functions with standard library and third-party modules for console interaction and display. It reads user input, modifies configuration, creates directories if needed, and displays data. There are no network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration routines. No hidden or malicious behavior detected. It relies on imported utility functions for language data, which are presumed safe. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical UI module for a command-line application with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles user interaction and display functions securely. No malicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
