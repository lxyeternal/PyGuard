  "purpose": "Manage user configuration settings for Dhvagna-NPI, including loading, saving, and default initialization.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'config.json' file during load; creating directories if they don't exist.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'config.json' file during save.",
  "flows": "Loading configuration data from 'config.json' to the Config object; saving data from Config object to 'config.json'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of json.load and open for file operations is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward configuration management: it initializes default values, creates a directory if missing, and loads/saves configuration data from/to a JSON file. Error handling during load is minimal but appropriate for this context. No input data comes from untrusted sources other than reading a local JSON file, which is typical for configuration files. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration management module with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles configuration data securely without executing untrusted code or connecting to external entities.",
