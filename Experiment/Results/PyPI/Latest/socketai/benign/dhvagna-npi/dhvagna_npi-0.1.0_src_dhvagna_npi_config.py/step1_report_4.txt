  "purpose": "The code provides a configuration management system for storing, loading, and saving user settings for the Dhvagna-NPI application.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem: 'config.json' and checks/creates the 'transcriptions' directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the filesystem: 'config.json' and possibly creates directories in the local filesystem.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration data from 'config.json' into object properties; saves data from object properties into 'config.json'; creates directory if not present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code appears straightforward and standard for configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes default settings, checks and creates necessary directories, and reads/writes configuration data to a JSON file in a predictable manner. There are no external inputs beyond filesystem reads, and no untrusted data sources are processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leakage. The try-except block on JSON loading is safe, defaulting to fallback values on error. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard configuration management functions without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It neither leaks sensitive information nor executes untrusted code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
