  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings for the Dhvagna-NPI application, allowing to store, load, and save user preferences.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from 'config.json' file; creates directories if needed.",
  "sinks": "Writes configuration data to 'config.json' file; creates directories in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "On save: data from config object to 'config.json'. On load: from 'config.json' to config object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No use of insecure functions or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration management class, initializing defaults, creating directories, reading from and writing to a JSON file. It handles exceptions during loading gracefully. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The use of relative paths and standard library functions does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration management module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It manages user preferences securely without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
