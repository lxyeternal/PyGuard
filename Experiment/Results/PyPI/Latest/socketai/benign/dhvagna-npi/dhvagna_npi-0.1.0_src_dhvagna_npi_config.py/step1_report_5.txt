  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings for the Dhvagna-NPI application, including saving and loading preferences.",
  "sources": "Reading from the filesystem: 'config.json' and creating directories; no external data sources or user input in this code.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'config.json' and creating directories in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from 'config.json' into the Config object, and saved back to 'config.json'. Directory creation occurs during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No external network activity or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class that initializes default settings, creates a directory if it doesn't exist, and reads/writes configuration data to a local JSON file. The load method handles file reading and JSON parsing with exception handling, but no external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. No malware-like behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The logic is simple and consistent with standard configuration management practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic configuration management without any malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. There is no indication of malware or malicious behavior. It is a benign utility for handling application settings.",
