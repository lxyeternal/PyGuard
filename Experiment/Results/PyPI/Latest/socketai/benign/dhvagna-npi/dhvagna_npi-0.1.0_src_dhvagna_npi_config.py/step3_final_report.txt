  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings for Dhvagna-NPI, including loading, saving, and directory setup.",
  "sources": "Reading 'config.json' file, accessing class attributes, creating directories if missing.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'config.json' file, creating directories on the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Initialization of defaults -> Directory creation -> Saving configuration -> Loading configuration from file.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal exception handling during JSON load; silent fallback on error, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler that initializes default settings, creates a directory if it doesn't exist, and loads/saves configuration data from a JSON file. It uses safe, standard library functions with proper exception handling during load. No user input, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or contain hidden backdoors. The file operations are typical for configuration management and do not pose security risks. The exception handling is minimal but acceptable; it defaults silently on load errors. Overall, the code is benign, clear, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration management module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
