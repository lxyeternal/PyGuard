{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line argument parsing and entry points for the Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments '--interactive' and '--version'; version info imported from module; core functions 'run_interactive' and 'run_single_transcription' invoked based on arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments parsed -> version info displayed or core functions called -> program flow based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward CLI code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface for a voice transcription tool, using argparse for argument parsing, displaying version info, and delegating core processing to imported functions. It contains no hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The core functions are external and not shown, but their invocation appears normal. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence that it is benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
