{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for the Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool, handling argument parsing and execution flow.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse; imports version info from local module; calls functions like run_interactive and run_single_transcription.",
  "sinks": "Executes run_interactive or run_single_transcription functions based on user input; displays version info.",
  "flows": "User input through command-line arguments flows into argument parser -> conditional execution triggers functions like run_interactive or show_version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI argument parsing and invoking other functions imported from the same package. No data is read from external sources other than command-line args. The functions invoked (run_interactive, run_single_transcription, main) are imported and not detailed here, but their invocation appears standard. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI handler for a voice transcription application. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident within this module.",
