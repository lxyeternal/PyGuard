{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line argument parsing and entry points for the Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse, imports version info, and calls main functions (run_interactive, run_single_transcription).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; standard output for version info and invoking core functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> parse_args -> conditional execution of show_version or core functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The version info is retrieved dynamically from a module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI interface module. It parses command-line arguments, displays version info, and calls core functions. No input validation or network communication occurs within this snippet. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears straightforward and secure, assuming core functions are safe.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard CLI interface with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply manages user input and invokes core functionality. No malware or security threats are evident.",
