{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line argument parsing and entry point for the Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse, imports version info and core functions.",
  "sinks": "Displays version information; runs either interactive or single transcription functions.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line options -> parse_args() -> run appropriate core functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages CLI argument parsing and program flow control. It imports core functions and version info but does not process untrusted data beyond user inputs. No external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI interface module with no malicious or suspicious activity. It performs typical argument parsing and function calls without any harmful operations.",
