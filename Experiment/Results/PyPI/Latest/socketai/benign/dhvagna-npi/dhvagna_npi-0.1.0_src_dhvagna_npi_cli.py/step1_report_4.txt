  "purpose": "Command-line interface for the Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool, handling argument parsing and execution flow.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line arguments, import statements for main functions and version info.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code executes functions based on user input, but does not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line args -> parse_args() -> conditional calls to run_interactive() or run_single_transcription() -> possible show_version() based on args.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no network or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses command-line options and calls imported functions. It safely handles arguments with no direct data processing or external resource manipulation. The version display uses a straightforward import and print. No data leaks, no external network activities, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI entry point for a transcription tool. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and typical for such applications.",
