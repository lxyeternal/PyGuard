{
  "purpose": "Provide command-line interface for Dhvagna-NPI voice transcription tool, handling argument parsing and execution flow.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--interactive, --version), imports from core module, version info from __version__",
  "sinks": "None detected that could lead to data leaks or security issues; no untrusted data handling beyond argument parsing",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from command line are used to control execution; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward argument parsing and version display",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines argument parsing with clear options, and executes functions based on user input. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or execute untrusted code. The version information is fetched from a module variable. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles argument parsing and calls external functions which are not provided here. No malicious activity detected.",
