  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static dictionaries and simple lookup functions.\n   - No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and static.\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n   - The assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` is 1.0 in all cases, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is purely static and safe.\n   - The highest scores are zero, which aligns with the code's benign assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there's no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as utility functions with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are evident.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward utility module with static mappings. There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scoring.**",
