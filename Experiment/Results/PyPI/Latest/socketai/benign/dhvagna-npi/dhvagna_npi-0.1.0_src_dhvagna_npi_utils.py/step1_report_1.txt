{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for language code translation and retrieval of language options.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are used; all data is hardcoded within functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data transmission occurs; functions return static or predefined data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; functions perform simple lookups and returns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward dictionary lookups and static data mappings. There are no input handling, external data fetching, or potentially unsafe operations. All functions are read-only and return predefined data. The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for internal use without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for language code mappings with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
