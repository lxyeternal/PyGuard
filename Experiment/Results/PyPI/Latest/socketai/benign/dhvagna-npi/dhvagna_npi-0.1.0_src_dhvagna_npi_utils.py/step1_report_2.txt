  "purpose": "Utility functions for language code management and retrieval of language information for Dhvagna-NPI.",
  "sources": "Function arguments: lang_code; internal dictionaries for language mappings.",
  "sinks": "Return statements delivering language names, dictionaries, and mappings.",
  "flows": "Input lang_code -> get_language_name; function calls -> return data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions that return static mappings or values based on input. The get_language_name function uses a predefined dictionary to map language codes to human-readable names. The other functions return static dictionaries. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond the provided parameters, no code execution, no external network or file operations, and no handling of sensitive data. All functions perform simple lookups or return static data, indicating no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility-based with static mappings and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its purpose without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
