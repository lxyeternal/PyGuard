  "purpose": "Provides language code mappings and options for language selection within the application.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries within functions, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple static functions returning predefined dictionaries for language codes and names. There is no external input, dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All functions are read-only and serve utility purposes. The code does not contain secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns. Multiple reviews confirm the benign nature, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence levels. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static utility functions with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
