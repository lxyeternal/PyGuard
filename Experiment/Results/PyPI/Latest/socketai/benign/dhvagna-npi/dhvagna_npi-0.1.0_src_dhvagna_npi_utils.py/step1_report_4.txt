  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for language code translation and retrieval of language options for the application.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries within functions; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The functions simply return predefined dictionaries or values based on input parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and uses standard data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static functions that return language name mappings and options. There are no inputs from external sources, no data processing, nor any code execution based on untrusted data. All data is hardcoded and retrieved directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely functional, providing language options and mappings without any malicious intent or security risks.",
