  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of static utility functions with hardcoded data mappings.\n   - No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or input handling from untrusted sources are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign and purely utility-based.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The reports do not overlook any potential security issues, as none are present.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk score of 0, and the code shows no malicious or risky behavior, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security or privacy.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - This score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility module with static mappings.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My Final Estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
