  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists of static dictionaries and straightforward lookup functions.\n   - No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or user inputs are involved.\n   - The code is benign, utility-focused, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n   - The functions are read-only and purely static.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the static, straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is static and safe, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n   - No claims or assumptions in the reports suggest otherwise.\n\n5. **Final Assessment**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is a standard utility module with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and safe. No changes are needed. The scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics.",
