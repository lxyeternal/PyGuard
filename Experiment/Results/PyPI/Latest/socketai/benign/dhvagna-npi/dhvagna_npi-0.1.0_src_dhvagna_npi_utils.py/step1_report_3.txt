  "purpose": "Utility functions for language code handling and mapping in the Dhvagna-NPI application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'lang_code' in get_language_name; internal function calls; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None. No data is sent to external systems or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input 'lang_code' flows into get_language_name and retrieves a language name from a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. All functions are straightforward and handle static data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple mappings between language codes and human-readable names, as well as dictionaries for available languages and their codes. No external data fetching, user input sanitization, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears well-structured, with clear and limited scope. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains benign, standard utility functions for language code management. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
