  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for language code handling and retrieval of language information.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries within functions that store language mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are static and read-only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward utility functions that return language mappings and descriptions. No external inputs are processed dynamically, no user input is read, and no network or file operations are performed. The dictionaries are static, hardcoded, and used solely for lookup purposes. No obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors, and no potential malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static lookup tables and functions for language mapping. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
