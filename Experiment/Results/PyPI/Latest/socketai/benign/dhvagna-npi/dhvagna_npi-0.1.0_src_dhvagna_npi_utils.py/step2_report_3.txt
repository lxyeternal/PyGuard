  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code consists of simple, static utility functions:\n     - `get_language_name`: Maps a language code to a human-readable name.\n     - `get_available_languages`: Returns a dictionary of language options with descriptive strings.\n     - `get_language_codes`: Returns a dictionary mapping option numbers to language codes.\n   - All data is hardcoded within the functions.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n   - No input sanitization issues, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They emphasize the static nature of the data, the absence of external inputs, and the lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0 in all reports, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports & Scores:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and accurately describe the code's benign and static nature.\n   - The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's characteristics.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; the code appears to serve its utility purpose safely.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n   - The data is static and hardcoded, which is typical for utility modules.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Final Scores:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the code is entirely benign.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0.\n   - The security risk score should be 0.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code does not perform any risky operations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and correct. No changes are necessary.",
