  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists of simple, static dictionary lookups for language codes and names.\n   - Functions are straightforward, returning predefined data without external input, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Report Summaries & Logic:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as benign, static, utility functions with no suspicious activity.\n   - They emphasize the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0 across all reports, indicating high certainty of safety.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified given the static, non-sensitive nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - No issues are identified in the code.\n   - The reasoning in the reports is sound and consistent.\n   - The scores are appropriate and do not need adjustment.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely static utility functions, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Score | Justification                                           |\n|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0       | No malicious activity detected; static data only       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0       | Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation present     |\n| Security Risk    | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified       |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign utility code with no security concerns.",
