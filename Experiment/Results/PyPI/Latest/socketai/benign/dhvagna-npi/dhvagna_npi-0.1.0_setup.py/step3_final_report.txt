  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script for dhvagna-npi.",
  "sources": "Reading static files (README.md, requirements.txt), package metadata definitions, entry points, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Static file reads for description and requirements, package metadata assignment, entry point definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static configuration tasks: reading files, setting package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a typical, benign package configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks, contains no obfuscation, and is safe to use.",
