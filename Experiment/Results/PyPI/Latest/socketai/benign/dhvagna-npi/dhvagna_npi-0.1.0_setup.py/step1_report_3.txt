{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the dhvagna-npi Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md and requirements.txt files, defines setup() parameters including package info, dependencies, entry points, and extra requirements.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data outputs or external network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files (README.md, requirements.txt), uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard setup tools and file reads with encoding are typical. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup procedures: reading long description and dependencies from files, configuring package metadata, and defining entry points and extras. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
