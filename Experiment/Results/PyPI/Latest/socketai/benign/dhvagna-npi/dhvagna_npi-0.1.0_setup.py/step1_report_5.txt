{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the dhvagna-npi package, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and additional requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; reading requirements.txt for dependencies; static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; all data sources are static files or predefined strings used for package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A — setup script primarily reads static files and assigns configuration parameters without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, reads static files for description and dependencies, and configures the package with metadata, classifiers, dependencies, entry points, and optional requirements. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No external data processing, user input, or suspicious activity detected. No dynamic code execution or network operations present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical configuration tasks safely.",
