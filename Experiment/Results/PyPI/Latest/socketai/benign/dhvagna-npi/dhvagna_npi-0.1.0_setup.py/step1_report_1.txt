{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up the 'dhvagna-npi' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, requirements.txt for dependencies, and package files in src directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configurations do not process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reads files (README.md, requirements.txt), then proceeds to package setup without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with typical package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file reading for package description and dependencies, then calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata and configuration. No code execution based on untrusted inputs or dynamic code generation occurs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URLs (besides project info) are present. The structure follows common setup.py conventions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. All data flows are limited to reading known files and defining package parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files for configuration and defines package metadata and entry points, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
