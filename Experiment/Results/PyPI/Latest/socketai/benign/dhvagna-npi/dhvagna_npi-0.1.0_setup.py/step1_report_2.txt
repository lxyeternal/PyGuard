{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'dhvagna-npi', facilitating package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package source files from 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted input; setup configuration primarily reads files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; no dynamic code execution or external command invocation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading static files, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and extra requirements. It does not execute untrusted code, invoke system commands, or handle sensitive data beyond reading static files. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
