  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided setup script step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The setup script reads static files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`) and defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and extras.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external command invocation, or untrusted data processing.\n   - The code structure follows standard Python packaging practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code appears correct and well-structured.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Score Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0.0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0.0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0.0`\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n4. **Justification of Risk Scores:**\n   - Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0.0.\n   - The malware score is 0 because the script does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent; they base their conclusions on observable facts.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis: all indicate no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration file. It performs no dynamic or suspicious operations, and all evidence points to a safe and typical setup process.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the existing scores. No changes are necessary.",
