  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure and install the 'dhvagna-npi' Python package, including reading metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading requirements.txt for dependencies, static package configuration data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration with no untrusted data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (README.md, requirements.txt) to populate package metadata and dependencies. It defines package metadata, classifiers, entry points, and extras. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic input processing occurs. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It securely manages package configuration without executing untrusted code or sensitive operations.",
