{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports the PumpSwapSDK class from a sibling module, facilitating its availability at the package level.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module path '.sdk.pumpswap_sdk' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only performs a static import.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; it does not lead to any data leaks or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static import statement within a package's __init__.py file. It does not execute any dynamic code, handle user input, or perform network operations. The import is from a relative module, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest benign intent, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization file that imports a class from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence.",
