  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The confidence is high (1), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are 0.  \n- No issues here; the analysis is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, it describes a straightforward import with no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- Scores are consistent with the minimal code.  \n- No concerns; the assessment is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also describes a simple import statement with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- The conclusion aligns with the code snippet.  \n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Again, describes a minimal import, no anomalies, no data flow, no malicious indicators.  \n- The assessment appears correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same pattern: a straightforward import with no suspicious elements.  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.  \n- **Malware and obfuscation:** All reports assign zero to malware and obfuscated scores, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Security risk:** Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The import statement itself is benign; however, **importing SDKs** can sometimes be risky if the SDK itself is malicious or compromised. But this cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.  \n- **Potential for malicious SDKs:** The report should note that the security of the imported SDK depends on its source and integrity, but since the code is only an import, no direct malicious activity is present here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident from this code snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, harmless package initializer importing a class from a local module. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign code snippet typical of Python package setup files.",
