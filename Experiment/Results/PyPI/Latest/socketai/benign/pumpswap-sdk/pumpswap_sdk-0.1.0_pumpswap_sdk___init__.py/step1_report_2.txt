{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the package by importing the PumpSwapSDK from a submodule, likely to expose SDK functionalities at the package level.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output is present; no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "The import statement potentially enables use of SDK methods, but no data flow is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard __init__.py that imports a class from a relative module, which is common for Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure is typical and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initializer with standard import statements, showing no malicious behavior or security risks.",
