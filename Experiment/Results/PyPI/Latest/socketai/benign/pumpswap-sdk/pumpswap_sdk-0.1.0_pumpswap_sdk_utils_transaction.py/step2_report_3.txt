  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, legitimate implementation for confirming and sending transactions on the Solana blockchain.\n- They note proper use of asynchronous API calls, standard error handling, and no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows.\n- The reports mention that error messages are printed to stdout, which is typical for debugging but could leak logs if not secured—yet this is not malicious.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern, primarily about potential log leaks rather than active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code functions as intended, with no embedded malicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The exception handling and network interactions are standard.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only minor concern is that verbose error printing could leak sensitive info if exceptions contain secrets, but this is a common debugging practice and not inherently malicious.\n- The code could be improved by removing or securing print statements in production, but this does not impact security directly.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports, justified by the potential for log leaks but overall low.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The low malware score (0) is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscation score (0) is justified; the code is clear and standard.\n- The risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal security concerns, mainly about error message exposure, not active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores; they are appropriate.\n- To improve security posture, consider replacing print statements with logging at appropriate levels or removing verbose error output in production.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly about log leaks)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the detailed analysis provided.",
