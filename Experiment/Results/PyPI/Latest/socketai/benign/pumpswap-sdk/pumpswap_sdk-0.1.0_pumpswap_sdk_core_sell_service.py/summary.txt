  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a token sale on Solana with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minor security concern is the handling of private keys, which is typical but should be managed securely in deployment. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
