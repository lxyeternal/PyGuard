{
  "purpose": "Fetches Solana program accounts filtered by mint address and WSOL token account, returning pool addresses or data.",
  "sources": "Reads mint_address parameter, RPC responses from get_program_accounts.",
  "sinks": "Processes account data into bytes and constructs PumpPool objects; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input mint_address -> RPC filters -> get_program_accounts response -> account.data -> bytes() -> PumpPool",
  "anomalies": "Uses bytes(account_data) on base64-encoded data, which may be redundant or incorrect; no decoding step shown.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard blockchain data retrieval with asynchronous RPC calls, filtering accounts based on offsets. The use of bytes() on account_data (likely base64 string) is a minor technical issue, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is appropriately zero; security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The code's purpose is read-only data access, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward blockchain data retrieval logic with no malicious intent. The only technical concern is the handling of account_data with bytes(), which should ideally decode base64 but does not pose security risks. Overall, the code is safe, with scores reflecting minimal security concern.",
