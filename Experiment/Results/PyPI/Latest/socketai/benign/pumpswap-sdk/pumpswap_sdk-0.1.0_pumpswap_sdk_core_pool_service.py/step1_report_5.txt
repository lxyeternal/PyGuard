  "purpose": "Retrieve specific pool address and data for a token mint from the Solana blockchain using custom filters.",
  "sources": "Reads mint_address (parameter), constants.WSOL_TOKEN_ACCOUNT, and network responses via get_program_accounts.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to get_program_accounts, usage of account data, and potential conversion of data to binary form.",
  "flows": "Input mint_address and constants.WSOL_TOKEN_ACCOUNT → API calls to Solana RPC → Response handling and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious variables. No unusual code structures. The use of bytes() on a base64-encoded string could be problematic but isn't malicious. Exception raising is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously interacts with the Solana blockchain to fetch program accounts filtered by specific offsets. It constructs filters based on input parameters and constants, performs network requests, and processes response data into structured objects. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The use of bytes() on account_data is potentially problematic, as account_data is likely base64-encoded, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are straightforward and serve data retrieval purposes. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data access module for a Solana-based application. It does not exhibit malware traits or malicious behavior. There is a minor concern regarding the handling of account data, but this is a normal part of blockchain data processing rather than malicious activity.",
