  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior and security risks.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input sources such as eval() calls, subprocess executions, network sockets, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "eval(), subprocess, network connections, environment variables, data flows into potentially dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "Sources (e.g., untrusted input) into sinks (eval(), subprocess, network calls) without validation, enabling potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns like eval() on untrusted input and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. Absence of such patterns correlates with benign assessments. Scores are aligned with the presence or absence of these suspicious behaviors. Without actual code snippets, the evaluation relies on report summaries, but the reasoning appears consistent and justified based on described patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates likely malicious behavior with high suspicion, justified by patterns like eval() and network activity, warranting a malware score of 0.65 and security risk of 0.75. Reports 2-5 show benign or empty code, with low scores appropriate to their descriptions. Overall, the scoring and reasoning are consistent and justified.",
