  "purpose": "Facilitates the purchase of a specified SPL token on Solana via Pumpswap, handling transaction creation, signing, and confirmation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'mint' (token mint address), 'sol_amount' (amount of SOL to spend), 'payer_pk' (private key of payer). External functions fetching pair address, token price, and generating WSOL accounts.",
  "sinks": "Transaction instructions sent to Solana network; untrusted data flows include token amounts, account addresses, and transaction signatures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> fetch pair address and price -> compute amounts -> generate WSOL account instructions -> assemble transaction instructions -> send transaction -> confirm transaction -> output result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Private key handling from input is standard but requires external secure management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Solana token purchase operations using well-known SDK functions. It constructs instructions, manages WSOL accounts, signs and sends transactions, and confirms success. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate. The only potential concern is private key management outside this code, which is typical in wallet operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for token purchase on Solana with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to external private key management. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
