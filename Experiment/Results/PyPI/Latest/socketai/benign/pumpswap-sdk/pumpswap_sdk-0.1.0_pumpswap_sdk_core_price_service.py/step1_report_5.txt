{
  "purpose": "Fetches the current price of a token in a Pumpswap pool on the Solana blockchain by retrieving pool data and token balances.",
  "sources": "Reads from Solana RPC client for token account balances, and retrieves pool data via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses token account balances for calculation; no direct data leaks or external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Retrieves pool data -> fetches token balances -> calculates price from balances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of await and async appears standard. No obfuscated code, no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously retrieves pool data and token balances from the Solana blockchain, then computes a token price. All operations are standard API calls to a blockchain client, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and uses well-defined functions. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical blockchain data retrieval and calculation script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to perform legitimate operations related to price calculation in a DeFi context.",
