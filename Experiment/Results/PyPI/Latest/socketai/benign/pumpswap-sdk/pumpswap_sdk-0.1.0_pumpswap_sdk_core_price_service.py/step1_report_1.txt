  "purpose": "Calculate the price of a token in the Pumpswap pool using on-chain data from the Solana blockchain.",
  "sources": "Reading token account balances from the Solana blockchain via AsyncClient.get_token_account_balance.",
  "sinks": "Uses the token balances to compute a price; no direct sink involving external data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Fetches pool data -> retrieves token account balances -> calculates price from balances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code asynchronously fetches pool data and token balances to compute a price. It uses well-defined SDK calls without any suspicious or malicious code patterns. No user input, environment variables, or external command executions are involved. The use of 'await' for network calls indicates standard asynchronous data retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate implementation for fetching and computing token prices from a Solana pool. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
