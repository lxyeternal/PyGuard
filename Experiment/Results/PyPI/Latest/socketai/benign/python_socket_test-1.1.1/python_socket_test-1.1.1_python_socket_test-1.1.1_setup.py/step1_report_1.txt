  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; importing setuptools for package setup; defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing; no insecure handling or suspicious data flows.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file (README.md) and configures package entry points; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of open() for long_description is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses it to define package metadata and entry points, which is standard practice. The long_description is read from a local file, which is typical and safe. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward setup configuration without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely to configure package installation parameters.",
