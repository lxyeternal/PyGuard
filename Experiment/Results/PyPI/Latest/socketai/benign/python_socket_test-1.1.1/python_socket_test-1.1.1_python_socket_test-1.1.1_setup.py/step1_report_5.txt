  "purpose": "This code is used to define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or actions; standard package setup code.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' → executing setup() with package configuration and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network operations or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations, importing necessary modules, and configuring package metadata, description, package discovery, and entry points. The 'long_description' reads from an external file, which is typical. No malicious functions, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly follows conventional setup.py patterns without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
