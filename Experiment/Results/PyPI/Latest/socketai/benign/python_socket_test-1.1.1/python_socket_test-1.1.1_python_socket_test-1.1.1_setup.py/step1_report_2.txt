  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test', including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description during setup",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed",
  "flows": "Reads static file 'README.md' during package setup; no flow from untrusted sources to critical functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, specifies package metadata, reads a static README file for description, and defines a console script entry point. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of find_packages() is standard, and no external data or user input is processed at runtime. No obfuscation, malware behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
