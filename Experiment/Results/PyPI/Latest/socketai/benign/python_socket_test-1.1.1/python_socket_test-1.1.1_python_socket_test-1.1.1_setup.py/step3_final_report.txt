  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, reading long description from README.md, and setting up a console script entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data processing; no data leaks",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager (minor best practice concern, not security issue)",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package requirements, and defines an entry point for a CLI command. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted data handling. The use of open() without a context manager is noted but is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not pose security risks. All reports agree on the benign nature of this code, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor issue of using open() without a context manager does not impact security. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, confirming the code's safety.",
