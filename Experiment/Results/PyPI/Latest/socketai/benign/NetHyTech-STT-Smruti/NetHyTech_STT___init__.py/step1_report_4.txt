  "purpose": "Automate web interaction using Selenium WebDriver to listen to audio input and write recognized speech to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads current working directory via getcwd() and reads/writes 'input.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "Writes user-recognized speech to 'input.txt' in the current working directory.",
  "flows": "Code retrieves 'output' element's text, processes it, and writes to 'input.txt' in the current directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded file path with Windows-style backslash; no explicit data validation or encryption for file handling. No suspicious network connections or obfuscated code. The commented-out options and driver setup are standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Selenium to control a Chrome browser, navigate to a specific URL, and interact with web elements identified by ID. It waits for a start button, clicks it, and then enters a loop where it monitors an 'output' element for changes. Recognized speech is written to a local text file. The code performs typical automation tasks with no suspicious or malicious logic. The file handling is straightforward, with no hidden data exfiltration or code injection. The only potential concern is writing to 'input.txt' without encryption or validation, but this is standard for many scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate automation script for voice recognition interaction. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalous or suspicious activities are evident.",
