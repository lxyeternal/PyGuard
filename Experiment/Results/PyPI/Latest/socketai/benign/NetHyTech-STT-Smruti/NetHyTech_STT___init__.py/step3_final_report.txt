  "purpose": "Automate browser interaction to listen for voice input, monitor output, and save recognized speech to a local file.",
  "sources": "Reading webpage elements (start button, output text), current working directory for file path.",
  "sinks": "Writing recognized speech to 'input.txt' on the local filesystem.",
  "flows": "Click start button -> monitor output element -> detect change -> write output to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Path uses Windows-style backslash, which may affect cross-platform compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome in headless mode, interacts with webpage elements to perform voice recognition, and writes output to a local file. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns are present. The script's behavior is typical for automation tasks. The only minor concern is the use of a Windows-specific path separator, which could be improved for portability. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk primarily related to local file handling, which is standard in such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign automation script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. No adjustments are necessary.",
