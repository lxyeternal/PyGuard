{
  "purpose": "Automate a Chrome browser to load a specific website and interact with page elements for listening functionality, then save output to a file.",
  "sources": "Reading current working directory via getcwd(), reading webpage content via Selenium WebDriver, reading and writing 'input.txt' file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'input.txt' file, printing to console.",
  "flows": "WebDriver interacts with webpage elements ('startButton' and 'output'), reads their states, then writes output text to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream' and '--headless=new' Chrome options for media and headless operation are standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network calls observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses Selenium to control a Chrome browser, load a specific URL, and simulate user interactions. It waits for specific elements ('startButton' and 'output') and writes the detected output to 'input.txt'. The use of 'webdriver_manager' automates driver management, and the code handles exceptions gracefully. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is present. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious loops, or obfuscated code are detected. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate automation script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard automation script for interacting with a webpage and recording output locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe based on the provided fragment.",
