  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions. No clear purpose indicating malicious intent is apparent from the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, function parameters, or possibly external files (if any are opened), but no external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or system calls, but none are evident or are used insecurely within the provided code.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observable in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and does not contain any suspicious patterns. No indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no obfuscated segments or unusual control flow structures.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no malicious intent detected.",
