  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on descriptions indicating absence of code or benign code.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows due to absence of code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all reports indicate no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are consistent with the descriptions and confidence levels. Given the lack of actual code, the assessments are appropriately cautious but indicate no immediate threat. The reasoning across reports is thorough and aligns with the evidence presented.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and very low security risk based on the provided descriptions. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
