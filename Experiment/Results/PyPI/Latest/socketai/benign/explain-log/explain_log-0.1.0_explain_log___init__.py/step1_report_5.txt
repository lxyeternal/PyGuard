  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately obvious malicious intent. It seems to perform typical operations, but without seeing specific details, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or network data (if present). However, the provided code snippet does not explicitly show such sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or execution of dynamic code. The code does not clearly contain such sinks based on the visible parts.",
  "flows": "The data flow from sources to sinks is not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet. No evidence of untrusted data being processed dangerously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code structure appears normal, with no obfuscated segments or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform operations such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and not suspicious. No malicious logic, such as code injection or backdoors, is detected. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious control flows suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious behaviors or supply chain threats detected.",
