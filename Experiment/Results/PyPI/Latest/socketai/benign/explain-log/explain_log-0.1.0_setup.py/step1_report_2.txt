  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python CLI tool named 'explain-log' that uses OpenAI for log explanation.",
  "sources": "The script reads package dependencies, package metadata, and the CLI entry point configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input directly; primarily configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; standard setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The author field is a placeholder ('Your Name'), which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. All dependencies are standard Python packages, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no embedded malicious code snippets, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The placeholder author name is non-malicious and common in template code. No anomalous or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign and standard setup configuration for a Python CLI tool. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
