  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that reads log data from stdin or a file, prompts the user for confirmation to send logs externally, and explains logs using an external function.",
  "sources": "Reads log data from stdin or specified log file, loads log content via load_log_file.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends log data to external service via explain_log function.",
  "flows": "Input source (stdin or file) -> user confirmation prompts -> explain_log(log_content) -> output explanation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External function explain_log is a potential data transmission point but is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI utility for log explanation, with safety prompts and user consent before transmitting data. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The external function explain_log may transmit data, but the code explicitly prompts for user approval, mitigating risk. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified by this external communication potential, while malware and obfuscation scores are 0 due to the straightforward, transparent code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI tool with appropriate safety measures. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. External data transmission is controlled via user prompts, keeping the overall security risk low. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
