  "purpose": "A command-line tool for explaining error logs using AI with user confirmation for data privacy.",
  "sources": "Reads log data from stdin or from a specified logfile using load_log_file.",
  "sinks": "Potential user input for confirmation prompts, and reading log content from stdin or files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from stdin or files into log_content, then into explain_log for analysis; user input for confirmation controls execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard usage of libraries and prompts. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations for CLI log analysis with user prompts to confirm data sharing. It reads logs securely from stdin or files, with safety checks and warnings before sending data. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All user interactions are for safety and consent, and external library usage is benign. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI tool for log analysis that includes safety prompts and standard library usage. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected. It responsibly handles user data with appropriate warnings and confirmations.",
