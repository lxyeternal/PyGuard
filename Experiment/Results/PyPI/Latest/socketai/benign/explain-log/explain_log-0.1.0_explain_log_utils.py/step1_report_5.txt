  "sinks": "Reading from the file system using open(). No external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'filepath' is used directly in open() to read file content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and typical for reading files.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a filepath, opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding while ignoring errors, and returns the entire file content as a string. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no use of untrusted input in a risky manner beyond reading a file. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard file reading utility with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
