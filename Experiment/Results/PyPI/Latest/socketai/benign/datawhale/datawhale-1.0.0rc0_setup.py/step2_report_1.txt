  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script, importing setuptools, reading a README.md for description, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, user input, or network activity.\n- Dependencies are common for data and finance-related Python projects.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior?** No. All reports agree that the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Code execution of untrusted input?** No.\n- **Dependencies?** They are standard and appropriate for the project domain.\n- **Obfuscation?** None detected.\n- **Malware?** No, all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Security risks?** None detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is appropriate.\n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n\n- The reports are very consistent; no contradictions are evident.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n- The analysis is thorough and matches the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.\n- No external or untrusted data handling.\n- Dependencies are common and safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious activity or payload detected.                 |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Code is clear, standard, and unobfuscated.                  |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.          |\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe scores provided in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis setup script is benign and typical for Python package distribution.",
