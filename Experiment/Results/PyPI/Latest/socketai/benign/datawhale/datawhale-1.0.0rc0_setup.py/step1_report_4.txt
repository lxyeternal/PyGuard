{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'datawhale' with specified metadata, dependencies, and package contents.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified. No network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code is primarily declarative setup configuration, with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. All dependencies are common data science and finance libraries; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for description and listing dependencies. No user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are typical for data processing and finance data collection. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely declares package metadata and dependencies.",
