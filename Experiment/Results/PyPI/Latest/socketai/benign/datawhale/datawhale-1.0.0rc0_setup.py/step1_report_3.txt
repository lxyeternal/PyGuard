  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'datawhale', including package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; sources are also dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or data leaks; no code execution or data output is present.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration; no data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. Dependencies are standard Python packages related to data processing and financial data handling. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. The code strictly follows conventional package setup practices. No sources, sinks, or flows suggest malicious intent. No anomalies detected. The script appears benign and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
