  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python package setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The dependencies are typical for a financial data processing package.\n- No dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or external data sinks are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code correctness?**  \n  The code is syntactically correct and follows standard practices.\n\n- **Dependencies?**  \n  All listed dependencies are common in data and finance-related Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and readable.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky behaviors.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign a score of 1 or close to it, but the justification indicates a low risk, and the code is benign.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should be **0** or very close to it, reflecting the benign nature of the setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all correctly assigned as zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The setup script is typical, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the low risk profile.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current code, the security posture is solid.",
