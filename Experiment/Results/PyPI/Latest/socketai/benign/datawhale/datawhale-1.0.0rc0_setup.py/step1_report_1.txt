{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'datawhale' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; package metadata and dependencies defined within setup()",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted input; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> package setup parameters; dependencies are declared but not used dynamically",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup script; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, reads a README file for description, and defines setup parameters including package info, dependencies, and classifiers. All code appears standard for Python package setup. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are typical for a data processing package, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
