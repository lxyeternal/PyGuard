  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'datawhale', defining metadata, dependencies, and package info.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, reading a README file, and specifying package info and dependencies. All dependencies are common for data/finance projects. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward and well-understood pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
