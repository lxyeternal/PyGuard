  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n   - It reads a `README.md` for the long description.\n   - It defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package data.\n   - All dependencies are common data science and finance-related packages.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - Based on the code, there are no issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The setup script is straightforward and follows conventional practices.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - Their confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since all reports are consistent and thorough, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n   - The code does not contain any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only minor note is the version string `\"1.0.0_rc\"` which indicates a release candidate, but this is not a security concern.\n   - The author’s name and email are publicly available and do not pose issues.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of the setup script.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the existing scores. The code is typical, transparent, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes needed. The setup script is safe and standard for Python package distribution.",
