{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an interface aggregating and exposing various modules related to infrastructure, task management, storage, and logging for a larger system, likely providing a unified API for internal components.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions from the 'datawhale.infrastructure_pro' package, which are sources of data or functionality: task_gragh, task_stage, storage, task_system, logging.",
  "sinks": "The code exports selected classes and functions via the __all__ list, which are intended to be used elsewhere; there are no explicit sinks that process untrusted input within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly visible here as this is mainly an import/export module; no data flow from source to sink is demonstrated within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code structure is straightforward, importing and re-exporting modules and functions without dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as an aggregator and exporter of various modules from a package, defining __all__ for public API exposure. It imports modules related to task graphs, stages, storage, task system, and logging. There is no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a clean, static interface aggregator with standard import/export syntax. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module acting as a façade for internal infrastructure components. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to provide a unified API surface for other parts of the system. Overall security risk is minimal.",
