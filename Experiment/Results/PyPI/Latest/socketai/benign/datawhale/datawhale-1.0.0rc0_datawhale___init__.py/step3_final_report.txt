{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface aggregator, importing various classes and functions from internal submodules of 'datawhale.infrastructure_pro' and re-exporting them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static imports from internal modules within 'datawhale.infrastructure_pro'. No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only consolidates imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and purely organizational.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports classes and functions from internal submodules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, no data processing, no user input handling, and no network or file I/O. The structure is simple and static, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. The purpose is purely organizational, serving as an API facade. Given these observations, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as an organizational interface. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are correctly set to 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, aligning with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
