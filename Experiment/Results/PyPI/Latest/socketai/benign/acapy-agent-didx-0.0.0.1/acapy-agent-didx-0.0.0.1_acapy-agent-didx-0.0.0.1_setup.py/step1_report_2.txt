  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'acapy-agent-didx' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, version, author, description, classifiers) for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup metadata is hardcoded and not influenced by external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The author and author_email fields are empty but that is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata. It does not include code execution, input handling, or any suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials or potential attack vectors. The package description suggests a placeholder or template, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks.",
