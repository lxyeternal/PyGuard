  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'acapy-agent-didx'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; static package metadata is used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; package metadata is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not inherently malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata to define the package. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious logic. The package description indicates it is a placeholder for security-related purposes. The absence of any code that reads external input or performs network or system operations suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with placeholder metadata. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
