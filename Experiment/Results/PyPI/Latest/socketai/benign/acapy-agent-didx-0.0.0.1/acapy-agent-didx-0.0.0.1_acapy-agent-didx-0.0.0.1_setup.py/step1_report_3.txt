  "purpose": "Define the metadata for a Python package named 'acapy-agent-didx'.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but not inherently suspicious; the description is generic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script used to package a Python project. It contains only metadata attributes such as name, version, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious constructs, no input handling, no environment variable usage, and no code execution. The setup configuration appears benign, serving solely for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to define package metadata without executing any code or handling untrusted data.",
