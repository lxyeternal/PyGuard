  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'acapy-agent-didx'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call that provides package metadata; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and classifiers. No external data is read at runtime, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The author and author_email fields are empty, which is not unusual but also not suspicious. There are no obfuscated elements or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to define package metadata for distribution.",
