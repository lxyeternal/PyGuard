  "purpose": "Define package configuration and metadata for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup() such as name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, which are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic inputs, code execution, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The empty author fields are likely placeholders. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the static, placeholder nature of the script, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script serving as a placeholder. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk detected. All reports and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
