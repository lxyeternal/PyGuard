  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and setup configuration for publishing a Python package named 'acapy-agent-didx'.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function parameters (name, version, author, email, description, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external sources or sinks; configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious; placeholder description suggests a non-functional or placeholder package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata. No external data is read or written dynamically. No suspicious functions, code injection, or malicious logic present. The package appears to be a placeholder with minimal metadata. The empty author fields and placeholder description may be atypical for production but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static package setup configuration for a placeholder package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The package seems intended as a non-functional or template package without harmful intent.",
