{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a third-party emoji converter library within a CLI function and executes it immediately, with no external data handling or network activity.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pyprettifier' within the 'cli()' function; creation of 'EmojiConverter' instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network communication, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import source to object instantiation; no external data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minor misspelling of filename ('cryptograohy') which appears to be a typo; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with a local import and object creation, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. The misspelling is likely a typo rather than an obfuscation attempt. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The dynamic import is standard and not inherently risky in this context. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor filename typo does not impact security significantly. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
