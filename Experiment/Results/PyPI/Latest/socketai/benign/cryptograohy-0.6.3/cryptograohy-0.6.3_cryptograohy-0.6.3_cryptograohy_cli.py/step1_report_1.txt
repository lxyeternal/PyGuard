{
  "purpose": "The script initializes an emoji converter from the pyprettifier library, likely for CLI-based emoji processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the pyprettifier library, and instantiation of EmojiConverter object",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or security effects",
  "flows": "Import pyprettifier -> instantiate EmojiConverter -> run cli() function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; dynamic import within function is standard but not suspicious in this context",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library pyprettifier dynamically within a function and creates an instance of EmojiConverter. The function cli() is called immediately. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or data leaks. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only initializes a library component for command-line use. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
