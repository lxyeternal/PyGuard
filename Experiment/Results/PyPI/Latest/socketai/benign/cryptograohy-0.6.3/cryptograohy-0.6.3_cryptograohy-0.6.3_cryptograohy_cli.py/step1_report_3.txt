  "purpose": "Initialize and execute a command-line interface that utilizes the pyprettifier library to convert emojis.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the pyprettifier library; instantiation of EmojiConverter object within the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems, no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of library → creation of EmojiConverter object within cli() → function call to execute CLI",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple CLI function that imports the 'pyprettifier' library and creates an EmojiConverter object. The import and object instantiation occur only when cli() is called. There are no external data sources, no network calls, or file operations. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger application, but in isolation, it does not perform any malicious activity or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI setup that relies on the pyprettifier library for emoji conversion. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
