  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and running the CLI interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'greet' from .core and 'cli' from .cly; execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() function, which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Imports -> cli() invocation, which may process untrusted data if the CLI handles user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply imports modules and runs a CLI.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from local modules and immediately runs the cli() function, likely starting a command-line interface. No malicious or suspicious code elements are evident. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a typical package entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent. It executes a CLI interface, which could process user input, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment.",
