  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements for '.core' and '.cly'; execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function call potentially runs external command-line interactions, which could be risky if cli() handles untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> execute cli() -> perform command-line interface actions.",
  "anomalies": "The direct call to cli() at the module level might execute code immediately upon import, which is generally not recommended and could be malicious if cli() performs harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from internal modules and executes cli() without any conditional checks. The immediate execution of cli() on import could be exploited if cli() handles untrusted input or performs unsafe operations. The code structure is minimal but the direct invocation of cli() warrants scrutiny. No other suspicious or malicious code is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose appears to be to set up the package and run a command-line interface. The immediate execution of cli() could pose security concerns if cli() performs unsafe actions, but there is no explicit malicious behavior in this fragment. Overall risk is low but warrants further review of the cli() implementation.",
