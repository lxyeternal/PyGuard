  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing the CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'greet' and 'cli' functions from internal modules; execution of 'cli()' at the end.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'cli()' which may execute command-line interface code that could potentially process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are loaded, then 'cli()' is invoked, possibly leading to user interaction or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code straightforwardly imports and runs 'cli()'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions: 'greet' and 'cli'. The 'cli()' function is called immediately upon module import, which suggests it starts a command-line interface. Without seeing the implementation of 'cli()', there is a potential concern if 'cli()' processes untrusted input or performs malicious actions, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and standard for a package entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical package initializer that immediately invokes a command-line interface. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this snippet alone.",
