  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and CLI, then executing the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() could potentially invoke untrusted code if cli() is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Imported functions may be invoked via cli(), which could process untrusted input from command line arguments or environment.",
  "anomalies": "Direct invocation of cli() at module load time is unusual; it executes immediately when the package is imported, which could be a concern if cli() handles untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules: 'core' and 'cly'. It then immediately calls the cli() function from the cly module. This pattern causes the CLI to run as soon as the package is imported, which can be unexpected behavior and potentially dangerous if cli() processes untrusted input or performs side effects without explicit control. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The main concern is the immediate execution of cli() without user confirmation or explicit function call, which could be exploited if cli() contains malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward and lacks obvious malicious code. However, the immediate invocation of cli() on import is unusual and could be used maliciously if the cli() function is compromised or handles untrusted input insecurely. The overall security risk is low to moderate, depending on cli()'s implementation.",
