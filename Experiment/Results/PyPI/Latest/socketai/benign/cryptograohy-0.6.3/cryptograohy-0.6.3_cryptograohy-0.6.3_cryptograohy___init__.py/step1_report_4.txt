  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing the CLI command.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, and the execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() may be a sink if it triggers user input or system commands.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from package modules to execution of cli(), which likely initiates the command-line interface.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules: core and cly, then calls the cli() function. This is typical for setting up command-line tools. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The cli() function's internal behavior is unknown, but based on this file alone, it appears standard. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an entry point for a CLI-based package, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues from the provided snippet.",
