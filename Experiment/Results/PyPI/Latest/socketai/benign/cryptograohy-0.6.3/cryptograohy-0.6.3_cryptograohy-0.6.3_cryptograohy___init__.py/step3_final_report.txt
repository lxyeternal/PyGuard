{
  "purpose": "Initialize package by importing functions and executing the CLI interface immediately upon import.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .cly modules, specifically 'greet' and 'cli'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which may process input or perform actions based on command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Import statements followed by direct call to 'cli()' during module load.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate invocation of 'cli()' at import time, which is unconventional and can lead to side effects or security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' and 'cli' from internal modules and calls 'cli()' immediately. This pattern is atypical as it causes side effects during import, potentially executing untrusted code if 'cli()' handles user input insecurely. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's structure. The main concern is the pattern of execution rather than malicious intent, but it warrants review of 'cli()' implementation. The code itself is straightforward and benign, but the pattern could be exploited if 'cli()' is malicious or mishandles input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign, with the primary issue being the immediate execution of 'cli()' at import time. This pattern is discouraged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting low malware and obfuscation risk but a moderate security concern due to the execution pattern.",
