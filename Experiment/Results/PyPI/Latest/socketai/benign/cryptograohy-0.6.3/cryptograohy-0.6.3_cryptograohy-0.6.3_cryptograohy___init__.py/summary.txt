  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign, with the primary issue being the immediate execution of 'cli()' at import time. This pattern is discouraged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting low malware and obfuscation risk but a moderate security concern due to the execution pattern."
