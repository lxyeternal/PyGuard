{
  "purpose": "Defines a response class for the file upload endpoint, extending a base file response class with optional metadata fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'src.million_verfier.responses' and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from incoming data (possibly user input) into class attributes; no active data processing or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data model class using Python typing and inheritance. It sets optional fields related to email verification stats. No input validation, no external data handling, nor side effects are present. It appears to be a straightforward data structure with no malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It contains no suspicious logic, no external data handling beyond typical type annotations, and no obfuscation.",
