  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code carefully.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward data container, extending a base response class, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data interactions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code is simple, using Python type annotations and default values, consistent with standard practices.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description; it is a plain data class with optional fields. No issues are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign data models.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which seems appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are present, risk scores should remain low (near zero).\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Confirmed as 0 across reports; aligns with the analysis.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they only describe the code as a data container with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—no anomalies or risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, well-structured data class for API responses.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, and at zero for overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
