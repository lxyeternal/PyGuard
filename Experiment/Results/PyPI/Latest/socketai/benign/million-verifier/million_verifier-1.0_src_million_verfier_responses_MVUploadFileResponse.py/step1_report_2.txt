  "purpose": "Define a response class for a file upload API endpoint in a verification service.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class attributes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; class only defines data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; class attributes are optional and default values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and type-annotated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary typing modules and a base response class, then defines a data class with optional fields related to file upload response metrics. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no indications of malicious behavior. The structure appears to serve as a data container, with no evidence of malicious or security-compromising functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data class for API responses, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system, but on its own, it is benign.",
