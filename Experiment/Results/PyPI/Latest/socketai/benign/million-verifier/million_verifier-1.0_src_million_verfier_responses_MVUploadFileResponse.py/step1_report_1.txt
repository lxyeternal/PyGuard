  "purpose": "Define a response class for the file upload API endpoint, extending a base response class with additional metadata fields.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class attributes initialized with default values.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class attributes set with static default values; no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of MVFileResponse with several optional fields initialized to default values. It is a data container with no logic, input/output handling, or external data interactions. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and data structure definitions consistent with standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data model defining a response structure for a file upload endpoint. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
