{
  "purpose": "This code defines a response data model for a file upload API endpoint, extending a base response class and including optional metadata fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines class attributes with default values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, as the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static data structure with no execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass of MVFileResponse with optional fields initialized to default values, serving as a data container. No dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions are present. The code is syntactically correct, follows standard practices, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the code. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
