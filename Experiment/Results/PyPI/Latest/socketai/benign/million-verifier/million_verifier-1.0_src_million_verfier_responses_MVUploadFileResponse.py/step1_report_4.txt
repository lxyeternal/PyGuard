  "purpose": "Define a response class for the file upload endpoint, extending MVFileResponse with additional optional fields for upload metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for type hints and the base response class; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no data is processed or output directly to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to class attribute assignment; no data flow to external sinks or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for response serialization, extending a base class. It contains only optional attributes with default values and no logic or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data class definition intended for API responses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
