{
  "purpose": "Defines a data model for the response to a file upload request in a verification service.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'src.million_verfier.responses' and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no input or data processing in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data is likely passed through instances of MVUploadFileResponse; no data flow analysis needed as no data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; class attributes are simple data fields with default values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass extending MVFileResponse, adding optional attributes for reporting verification results. It primarily serves as a data container with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no obfuscated elements, and no security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger API response structure without any embedded malicious behavior.",
