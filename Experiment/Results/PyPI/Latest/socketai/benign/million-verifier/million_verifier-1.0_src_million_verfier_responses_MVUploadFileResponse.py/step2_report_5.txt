  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a subclass of `MVFileResponse`, defining multiple optional fields with default values.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code, input/output handling, or external data interactions.\n   - The code appears to be a simple data container (likely a Pydantic model or similar).\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - They emphasize the absence of obfuscation, dynamic code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The analysis is consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n**No notable errors or flaws in the reports.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**No adjustments needed here.**\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code indicate no malicious activity, high risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code is purely a data model with no security implications.\n\n**Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious code, or behavior.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n\n**Malware score should be 0.**\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and assume benign intent based on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n**This is appropriate.**\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward data model with no malicious or security concerns.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or suspicious elements. It does not process untrusted data, contain secrets, or execute code. The reports correctly identify this benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary.",
