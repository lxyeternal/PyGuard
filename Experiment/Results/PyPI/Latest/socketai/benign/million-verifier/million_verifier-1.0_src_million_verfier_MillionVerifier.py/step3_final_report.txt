{
  "purpose": "A Python API client for the MillionVerifier service, handling email verification, bulk uploads, status checks, and downloads.",
  "sources": "Network requests to API endpoints, reading files for upload, writing files for download.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from network responses, file system writes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (email, file paths) used in network requests and file operations; responses processed and stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "Open files in _upload_file() and _get_file() without context managers, leading to potential resource leaks but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions with proper error handling, no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The only concern is resource management due to open() calls without context managers, which could be improved but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. Malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation score as 0, and security risk score as approximately 0.2 due to minor resource handling issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API client with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. Minor resource management issues are present but do not elevate security concerns. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
