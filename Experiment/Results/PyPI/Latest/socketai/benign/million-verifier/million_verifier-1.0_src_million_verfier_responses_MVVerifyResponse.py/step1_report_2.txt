{
  "purpose": "Define a response class for the GET /search request, encapsulating various response attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' in __init__, class attributes for response data",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is directly used to execute code or access sensitive resources",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from 'data' into class attributes, with a conversion of 'error' into MVError if present",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and typical for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The class defines data attributes for a response object, with a constructor that initializes the superclass and conditionally converts an 'error' field into an MVError object. No external data is executed or sent over networks, and no suspicious behaviors such as backdoors, hidden code, or malicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a typical data container pattern with minimal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply encapsulates response data for an API call without any suspicious operations.",
