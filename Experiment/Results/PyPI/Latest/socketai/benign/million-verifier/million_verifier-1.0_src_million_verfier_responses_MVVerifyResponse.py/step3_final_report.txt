  "purpose": "Defines a data model class MVVerifyResponse for email verification responses, extending MVResponse with additional optional fields.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to __init__, particularly the 'error' field.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of self.error into MVError, which is a safe type cast; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> constructor -> superclass initialization -> conditional error conversion into MVError.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward data handling with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple data container extending MVResponse, initializing various optional fields. The constructor calls the parent constructor and converts the 'error' attribute into an MVError object if present. No external resource access, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code is clear, safe, and typical for API response models. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The conversion of 'error' is a standard pattern for type safety. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
