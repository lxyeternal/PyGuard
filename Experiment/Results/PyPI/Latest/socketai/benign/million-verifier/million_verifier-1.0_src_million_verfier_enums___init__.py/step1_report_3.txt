{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import two classes or modules, MVError and MVStatus, likely for error handling and status management within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules or packages (.MVError and .MVStatus). No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident in this code fragment, as it only performs import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this snippet since it only imports modules; no data processing or flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two import statements from relative modules within the package. No external data input, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The snippet appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as setup or import dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this fragment. It is a standard import statement likely used for error handling and status management.",
