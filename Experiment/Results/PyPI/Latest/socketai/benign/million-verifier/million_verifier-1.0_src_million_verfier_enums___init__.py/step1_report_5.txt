  "purpose": "Importing custom exception and status classes from the local package modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing MVError and MVStatus from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for a module's import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules MVError and MVStatus. There are no operations, data processing, or external calls. The structure is standard for Python packages to import internal classes or exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present. The simplicity suggests no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import internal classes for use elsewhere in the project. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
