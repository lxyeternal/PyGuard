  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only contains import statements for `MVError` and `MVStatus` from local modules.\n   - There are no data flows, external communications, or data processing activities.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python projects, serving as setup or dependency imports.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No reports identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code that could be exploited.\n   - The import statements are straightforward and typical.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The reports do not identify any errors or flaws.\n   - The code is syntactically correct and idiomatic.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Justification of Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - Malware score should also be 0, as there's no malicious behavior detected.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.\n\n6. **Potential Claims or Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any suspicion based on the provided code snippet.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are justified here, given the simplicity.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed reasoning above.",
