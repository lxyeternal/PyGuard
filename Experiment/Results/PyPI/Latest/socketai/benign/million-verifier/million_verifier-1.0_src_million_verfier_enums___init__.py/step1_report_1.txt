{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing two classes or modules, MVError and MVStatus, likely used elsewhere in the project for error handling and status reporting.",
  "sources": "The source of data is not explicitly shown in this snippet; it only contains import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution flows within this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple, with standard relative imports. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only consists of import statements for two modules or classes, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other actions that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this small code fragment, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical import statement setup, and nothing suspicious is present.",
