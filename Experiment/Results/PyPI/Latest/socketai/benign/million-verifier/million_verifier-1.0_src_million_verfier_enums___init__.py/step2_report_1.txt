  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of local modules/classes (`MVError` and `MVStatus`).\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data processing are present.\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard Python import statements.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign based on the provided snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippets. The import statements are straightforward and typical.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:**\n  - `malware`: 0 in all reports, consistent with benign import statements.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, as no obfuscation is observed.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0, as there are no security-related concerns in the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- Since the code is just import statements, there is no basis for assigning any higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and typical.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided snippets and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or code behavior is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk is evident from this minimal code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If future code includes dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n- For now, the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk for this code snippet.",
