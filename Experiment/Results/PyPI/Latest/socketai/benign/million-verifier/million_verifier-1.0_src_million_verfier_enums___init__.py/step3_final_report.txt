  "purpose": "Import local modules MVError and MVStatus for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from the current package directory: 'from .MVError import MVError' and 'from .MVStatus import MVStatus'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing classes from sibling modules within the same package. These are standard relative imports, with no external data sources, network activity, or embedded logic. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import statements do not involve any dynamic execution or external inputs. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is benign, consisting solely of standard import statements for local modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
