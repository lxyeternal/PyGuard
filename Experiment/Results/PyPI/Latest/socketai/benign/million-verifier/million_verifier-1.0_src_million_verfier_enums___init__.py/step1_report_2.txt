  "purpose": "Importing error and status classes from local modules, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in these lines.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with relative module references; no unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes, MVError and MVStatus, from sibling modules. These are standard import statements without any embedded logic or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The snippet appears to be part of a modular Python project following typical import patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving only to import classes from local modules. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
