  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class representing various error statuses related to a model or process.",
  "sources": "The class definition and string assignments within the Enum members.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. Enum members are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with string members indicating different error statuses. There are no input/output operations, no use of untrusted data, nor any code execution or external interactions. The Enum members appear to serve as constants for error reporting. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard enum class for error statuses with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
