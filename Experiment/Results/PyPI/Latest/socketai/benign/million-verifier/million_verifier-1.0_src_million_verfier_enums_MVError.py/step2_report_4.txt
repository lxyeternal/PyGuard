  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enum class defining error status strings. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no external interactions. The code appears static and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a simple enum with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Appropriate, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious behavior is detected or implied.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Justified, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.  \n   \n   Since all reports concur, their scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   The code does not warrant a higher risk score. It is purely a static enum definition for error statuses, with no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding assumptions about potential vulnerabilities. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign enum class with no security concerns.**",
