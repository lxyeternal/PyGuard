{
  "purpose": "Defines error status constants for a model or application using an Enum class.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes within the Enum; no external data sources or input points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; code does not process untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Enum class with string values representing error statuses. It contains no input/output, external interactions, or dynamic behavior. The code is syntactically correct, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's static and harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Enum class defining error statuses. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The scoring across reports is accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
