{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class MVError listing possible status messages related to model results.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines a static class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; the enum is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, then defines MVError as a subclass with specific string values for different status types. There are no input operations, data processing, or external interactions. The string values are static and appear intended for status reporting, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition for status codes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is standard and benign.",
