{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various error statuses related to a model or system.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines an enum with string values.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, inputs, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this code is purely a static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard enum declaration with string values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'MVError' with several string members representing different error states. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external interactions. The enum members are straightforward and contain no hardcoded credentials, code injection points, or malicious constructs. The purpose appears to be for internal status handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malware, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, static, and typical for defining error statuses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign enum definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
