  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Enum class defining string constants for error statuses.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n   - The code is syntactically correct and semantically simple.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a benign, static enum class.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk scores are 0, which is justified because:\n     - The code is static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behaviors.\n     - No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious activities are present.\n     - The code serves as a simple constants holder, which inherently carries minimal security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, but given the potential for misuse in different contexts, though none are evident here)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe enum class for error statuses. It poses no security risks or malware concerns. The current scores are accurate and appropriate.",
