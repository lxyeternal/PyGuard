  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various error/status messages related to a model or system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; only class definitions with static string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; enum members are straightforward string assignments with no hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an Enum class 'MVError' with string values representing different status messages. It is a simple, static class definition with no dynamic execution, external data input, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. The class serves as a structured way to handle status messages within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless enumeration definition used for status messaging. It poses no security risks, does not contain malware, and is not obfuscated.",
