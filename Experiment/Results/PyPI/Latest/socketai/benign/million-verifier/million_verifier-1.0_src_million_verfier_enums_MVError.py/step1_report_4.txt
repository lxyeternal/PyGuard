{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for representing various error statuses related to a model or system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code is only defining an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists solely of a standard Enum class with string values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module, then defines a class MVError inheriting from Enum with four members representing different error states. All members are simple string values, with no external data input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious constructs. The purpose appears to be to standardize error status representations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, harmless enumeration definition with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not read external data, perform network operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code.",
