  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'million_verifier'.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, reading 'README.rst' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info used for determining Python version; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operation.",
  "anomalies": "Using max(sys.version_info[1], 10)+1 to set version_range_max is unusual but not malicious; open('README.rst') without error handling is standard but could cause issues if file missing, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution. It dynamically constructs the list of supported Python versions based on the runtime environment, which is common practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No use of untrusted inputs for critical operations beyond reading a file, which is typical. Overall, the script appears benign, focusing on package configuration without executing suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the dynamic calculation of 'version_range_max', which is harmless but somewhat unconventional. No malware, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
