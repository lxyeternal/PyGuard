{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'million_verifier', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info, reads README.rst file for long description, and gathers package data with find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly feed into security-sensitive sinks; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous context.",
  "flows": "Version info is used to generate Python version classifiers; README content is read for long_description. No flow of untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is dynamically constructing the list of Python version classifiers based on the current Python version, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package metadata. It dynamically generates Python version classifiers based on the environment's Python version, which is typical. The README file is read without any evident malicious manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform any malicious activity or risky operations. It is a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
