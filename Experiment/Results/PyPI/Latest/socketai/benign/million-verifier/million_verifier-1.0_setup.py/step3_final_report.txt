  "anomalies": "Dynamic calculation of 'version_range_max' using max() on sys.version_info; reading README without error handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports sys and setuptools, calculates 'version_range_max' based on current Python version, and uses it to generate classifiers. It reads the README file for long description. No dynamic code execution, input validation, or untrusted data processing is present. The dynamic classifier generation is unconventional but benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected. The code's structure and behavior are typical for a setup script, with minor anomalies that do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic classifier list is unusual but harmless. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation is present.",
