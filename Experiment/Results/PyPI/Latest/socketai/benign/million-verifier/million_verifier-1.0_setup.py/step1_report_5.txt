{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'million_verifier'.",
  "sources": "Reading system version info, reading 'README.rst' file, importing modules, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct data sinks or untrusted data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> get Python version info -> use setuptools to define package configuration -> read README file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, focusing on package setup. The 'long_description' reads from a file, which could potentially be manipulated, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, determines maximum Python version component, and uses setuptools to configure package installation parameters. It dynamically creates a list of Python versions for classifiers based on the current Python interpreter version. There are no indications of malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. The dependencies are minimal and standard. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a Python package distribution.",
