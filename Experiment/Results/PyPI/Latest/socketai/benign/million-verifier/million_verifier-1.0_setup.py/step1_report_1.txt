{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'million_verifier' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (for Python version), open('README.rst') for long description, static strings for package info and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output happening.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to critical sinks; data is mainly used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The dynamic construction of Python version classifiers is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system info and setuptools for package setup. It calculates a maximum Python version for classifiers. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The use of sys.version_info to determine classifiers is routine. Reading the README file is typical for long description. No input/output handling of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious code constructs are present. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
