{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'million_verifier'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'setuptools', and reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; installation and package metadata are standard.",
  "flows": "Reads system info for Python version; uses it to generate version classifiers, then proceeds with standard setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'max(sys.version_info[1], 10) + 1' for 'version_range_max' appears unnecessary for typical setup scripts; no other suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system information, calculates a maximum version number, and configures package metadata for distribution. The version calculation is straightforward and does not influence runtime behavior beyond classifier generation. No external inputs are used in a malicious way, no data leaks, and no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected in this code.",
