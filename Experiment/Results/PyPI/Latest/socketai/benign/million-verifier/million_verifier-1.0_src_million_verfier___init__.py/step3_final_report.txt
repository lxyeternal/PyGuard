  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to verification, responses, exceptions, and a verifier class, serving as setup code for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .enums, .responses, .exceptions, and .MillionVerifier modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements do not process external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no data processing, dynamic code execution, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minimal security risk score in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the benign nature of static imports. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting no malicious activity. The only necessary adjustment is to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports, including the one with 0.1, to accurately represent the code's safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should uniformly be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
