{
  "purpose": "Import statements for modules and classes used in a larger Python package, likely related to verification or response handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing enums, responses, exceptions, and a verifier class from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; code only imports modules and classes.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports; the import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is typical in package initialization or module setup. There are no dynamic code execution, user inputs, or network operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. The imported modules seem related to a verification system, with enums, responses, exceptions, and a verifier class. The structure appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import block without any suspicious or malicious activity. It simply includes necessary components for a larger package. No malware or security risks are evident.",
