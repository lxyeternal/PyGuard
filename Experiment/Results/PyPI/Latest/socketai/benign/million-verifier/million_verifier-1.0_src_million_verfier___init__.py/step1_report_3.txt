  "purpose": "Import statements for modules, classes, and exceptions used in a larger Python package related to verification processes.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling enums, responses, exceptions, and a verifier class from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; the code only imports modules and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this code does not process data directly, it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, which are standard for module initialization. No data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded logic are present. It appears to be a typical module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements for a verification package. No malicious activity or security issues are detected based on this fragment.",
