{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various classes and exceptions related to verification, responses, and errors for a larger application or library, possibly related to a verification service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .enums, .responses, .exceptions, and .MillionVerifier.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this snippet; it only sets up namespace imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. These imports suggest usage of enums, response objects, exceptions, and a verifier class. There is no processing, input reading, or untrusted data handling shown. The structure is typical for a modular Python package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed based on these imports alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import setup for a verification-related package. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks in its current form.",
