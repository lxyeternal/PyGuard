  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to statuses, responses, exceptions, and a verifier class, likely part of a larger verification system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: enums, responses, exceptions, and MillionVerifier class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file operations, or untrusted data processing present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in these import statements; they only load modules/classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The imports are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing enums, response classes, exceptions, and a verifier class from local modules. There is no data processing, input reading, or output happening here. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is observable at this level. The imports seem standard for a Python module setting up its dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is purely preparatory, importing necessary components for the module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these statements alone.",
