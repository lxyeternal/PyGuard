  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only performs import statements from local modules (.enums, .responses, .exceptions, .MillionVerifier). No data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no anomalies, no obfuscation, and no malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, just import statements with no apparent malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, straightforward imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, only import statements, standard for module setup.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic behavior, no anomalies, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports only, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Discussion:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the code's nature (just imports), this is likely an overestimation. The report itself states no suspicious behavior, and the small risk score seems unwarranted. It might be a default or conservative assignment, but it should be 0 for such benign code.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce the security risk score to 0, aligning with the rest.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—import statements only.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Almost all zero, except Report 4's 0.1, which appears unjustified given the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippets are purely import statements, typical for module setup.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The slight security risk score in Report 4 should be lowered to 0.\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in such static import code)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The only adjustment needed is to lower the small security risk score in Report 4 to zero for consistency and accuracy.",
