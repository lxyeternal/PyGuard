{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for tracking different statuses, likely used within a larger application to represent process states.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code fragment.",
  "targets": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or effect are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present as there are no data inputs or outputs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The use of Enum with string values is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class MVStatus with four status members, each assigned a string value. The implementation uses standard Python Enum patterns with no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a simple, clean enumeration definition suitable for tracking process states.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
