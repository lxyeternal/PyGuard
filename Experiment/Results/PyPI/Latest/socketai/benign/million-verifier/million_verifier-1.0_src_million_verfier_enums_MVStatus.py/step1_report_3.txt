  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for representing different statuses of a process or operation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code defining an Enum class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a class definition with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Enum class with standard Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'MVStatus' with four status options. All elements are simple string values, and there are no dynamic executions, data manipulations, or external data inputs. The code appears to be a standard, benign Enum definition for status representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Enum class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious logic, or external data handling.",
