{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various statuses related to MV (presumably a process or task)",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; the code does not perform data output or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Enum class with four string members. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or security-sensitive operations. The use of Enum is standard for representing constant states. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward enumeration definition with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears benign and purpose-specific.",
