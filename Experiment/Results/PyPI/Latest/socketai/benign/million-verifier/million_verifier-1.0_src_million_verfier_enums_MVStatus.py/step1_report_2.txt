  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for tracking the status of a process or operation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines an Enum class without external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Enum class definition without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a subclass MVStatus with four status members. The members are simple string assignments and do not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard enum definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It serves as a simple status indicator, and there are no indications of malicious activity or sabotage.",
