  "purpose": "Define a status enumeration for MVStatus with four string states.",
  "sources": "The Enum class members: none, in_progress, success, unknown.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static enum definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum with clear string values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Enum class defining four string states. It contains no input/output, external data handling, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The enum members are standard and serve as status indicators. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard enumeration with no security issues or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
