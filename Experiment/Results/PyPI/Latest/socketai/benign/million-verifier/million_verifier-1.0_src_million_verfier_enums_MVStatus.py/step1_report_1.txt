  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class MVStatus with specific status values",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; no data flow paths present as there are no inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with four string members representing different statuses. It is straightforward and uses standard Python enum syntax. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to serve as a simple status indicator enumeration, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation of an Enum class.",
