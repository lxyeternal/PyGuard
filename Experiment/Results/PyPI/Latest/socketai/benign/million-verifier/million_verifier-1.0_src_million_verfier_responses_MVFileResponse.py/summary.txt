  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data parser with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary issue is robustness in handling empty or malformed responses, which could cause runtime errors but does not constitute security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, with malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."
