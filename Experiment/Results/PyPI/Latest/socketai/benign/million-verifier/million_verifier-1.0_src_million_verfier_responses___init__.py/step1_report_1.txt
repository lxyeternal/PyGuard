{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various response classes within a module, likely used to structure API or system responses.",
  "sources": "None; this code only contains import statements with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs in this snippet; only class imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from relative modules, which suggests modular design. No code execution, data handling, or dynamic behaviors are present. Since only import statements are included, there is no indication of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. The absence of functions or executable code reduces the risk of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall structure appears standard for a Python package defining response classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of basic import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard module import code used to organize response classes, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
