  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is only import statements, no executable code or data processing.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no suspicious constructs, straightforward imports.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements, no data handling or external interactions.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws detected; reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Matches the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation, purely structural.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Static import statements only.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; reasoning is correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Only relative import statements, no executable code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard import pattern.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, just import statements.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with straightforward import syntax.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- Since the code is purely import statements, a malware score higher than 0 would be unjustified unless additional context suggests malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign and standard for module organization.",
