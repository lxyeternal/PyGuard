  "purpose": "Import statements for response classes used in handling various response types within a module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules/classes within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data flows; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or execution beyond import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; straightforward import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes from local modules. There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of these imports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements with no malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
