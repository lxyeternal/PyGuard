  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from local modules within a package, likely for handling responses related to multimedia or file operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from local modules within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; purely import statements without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, dynamic imports, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports several classes from local modules, indicating structured code organization. No external input, data processing, or network operations are present. The structure appears standard for a Python package managing different response types. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident in these import statements. Given only this snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for module classes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
