  "purpose": "The code provides functions for validating email format and password strength.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters 'email' and 'password' passed to them.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, code execution, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to validation logic, with pattern matching but no external communication or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex patterns to validate email format and password complexity. It performs standard checks without external dependencies or hidden behaviors. No data is transmitted or stored insecurely, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic, legitimate validation script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
