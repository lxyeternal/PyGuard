  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to validate email format and password strength.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'email' and 'password' in the functions 'is_valid_email' and 'is_valid_password'.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external sources or used in a way that could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters through validation logic; no external data flows or external effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code performs straightforward validation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regular expressions for validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Functions are self-contained, with no external network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated code. Overall, the functions serve a standard validation role without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of input validation functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended solely for input validation purposes.",
