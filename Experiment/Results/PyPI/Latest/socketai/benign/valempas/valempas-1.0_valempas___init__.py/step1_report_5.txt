{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for email format and password complexity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters 'email' and 'password'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that send data externally or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters through regex matching functions; no external data transmission or modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The regex patterns are standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validation functions: one for email format using a straightforward regex, and another for password strength that checks length and character variety. Both functions operate locally, with no external calls, file operations, or network activity. The use of regex here is typical for validation purposes, and there is no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code. The functions do not process or store sensitive data beyond validation and do not include any backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple validation logic with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is designed solely for input validation purposes without any harmful side effects.",
