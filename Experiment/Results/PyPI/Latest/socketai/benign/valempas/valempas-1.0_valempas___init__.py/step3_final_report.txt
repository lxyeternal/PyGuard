  "purpose": "Validation functions for email format and password complexity",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'email' and 'password' provided to functions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; validation results are returned locally",
  "flows": "Input data flows through regex matching checks within each function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard regex patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple validation using regex for email and password; no external calls, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The regex patterns are standard and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. The code's logic is clear, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. All signals indicate benign, intended validation functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of email and password validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. The slight variation in report 4's securityRisk score (0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
