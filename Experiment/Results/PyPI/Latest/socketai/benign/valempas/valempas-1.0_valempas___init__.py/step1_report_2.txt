  "purpose": "Provide functions for validating email format and password strength.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'email' and 'password' for the respective validation functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions return boolean values based on validation; no direct data sinks or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked against regex patterns; no external data flows or untrusted data leakage identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two straightforward validation functions utilizing regex for email format and password complexity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions perform basic validation tasks securely without dangerous operations. The regex patterns are standard and appropriate for their purposes. No anomalous or malicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard validation functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for input validation purposes.",
