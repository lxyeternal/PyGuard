{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for validating email formats and password strength.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments 'email' and 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data that could lead to leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input (email/password) flows through validation functions where regular expressions are used to verify format and complexity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious operations detected. The code strictly performs validation checks without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validation functions using regular expressions to verify email format and password complexity. There are no external data reads, network communications, or file operations. The logic is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common validation patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The functions do not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm beyond basic validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for validation purposes and contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as a typical utility for input validation with no signs of malware or security risks.",
