      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of email and password validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate; the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0. The slight variation in report 4's securityRisk score (0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose."
