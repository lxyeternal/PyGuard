  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the execution of some process that involves input/output operations, possibly related to network or system interactions.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, file reads, and network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network calls or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, or hidden network connections. Hardcoded credentials or suspicious domain addresses would be notable if present.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads was found. The code uses standard Python libraries for input/output and network operations, with no signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access. No hardcoded credentials or malicious system modifications were detected. The code structure and comments (if any) are consistent with legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate script, assuming no hidden or external payloads. The malware score is low, and the security risk score indicates minimal threat.",
