  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from user, environment variables, network sources, files, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Network functions, file writing, system commands, subprocesses, data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, network) to sinks (network, files, system commands), possibly passing through eval/exec or processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews across reports indicate minimal or no malicious activity, with low obfuscation and security risks. Report 1 shows potential dynamic code execution and hardcoded credentials, justifying slightly higher concern, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. Other reports demonstrate straightforward, benign code with no suspicious patterns. Scores are consistent with the descriptions, with malware scores mostly at 0 or 0.2, obfuscation scores low, and moderate security risk in Report 1. Confidence levels are high where code is clear, slightly lower where details are limited.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign overall, with minor concerns in Report 1 related to eval/exec and hardcoded secrets. Scores are justified and align with the analysis, indicating low malware and obfuscation risks and low to moderate security risks. No evidence warrants higher threat levels.",
