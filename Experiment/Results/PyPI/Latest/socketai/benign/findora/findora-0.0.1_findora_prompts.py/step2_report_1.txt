  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static prompt templates, regex patterns, and formatting instructions.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data processing beyond string formatting.\n   - All patterns are straightforward, designed for input validation or output formatting.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, static, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a set of prompt templates with no active processing or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or inconsistencies are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static prompt templates with no execution or data handling, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is justified given the absence of any malicious or suspicious code behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable static templates.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - The assessments are aligned with the detailed analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a static configuration of prompt templates, regex patterns, and formatting instructions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the nature and safety of the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, static, and designed solely for prompt management within an AI system. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
