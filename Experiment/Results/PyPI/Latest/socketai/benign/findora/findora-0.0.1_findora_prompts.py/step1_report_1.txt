  "purpose": "Define structured prompts for a search query validation, enhancement, and search process",
  "sources": "Prompt definitions, including regex patterns and instruction templates",
  "sinks": "Regex pattern matching, string formatting, and data output sections",
  "flows": "User input processed through prompts, regex validation and extraction, formatted output generation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded prompt templates, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured prompt templates for different search-related tasks, including validation, enhancement, and search result formatting. It uses regex patterns to enforce input formats and defines specific output formats. All code appears static, with no external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of prompt templates for search query processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a static prompt configuration without runtime vulnerabilities.",
