  "purpose": "Static prompt templates and regex patterns for search query validation, enhancement, and result formatting in an AI system.",
  "sources": "User input fields ({search_query}, {search}), static string templates, regex pattern matching for validation and extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only formats and validates strings without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input data (search queries) are validated or enhanced via regex or string formatting; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely static with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static prompt templates, regex patterns, and formatting instructions. No dynamic code, network calls, or data processing logic are present. Regex patterns are straightforward, used for validation or extraction. The code does not contain secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, safe design. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is safe for deployment as a prompt configuration, with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, safe set of prompt templates and regex patterns for an AI system. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate given the static nature of the code.",
