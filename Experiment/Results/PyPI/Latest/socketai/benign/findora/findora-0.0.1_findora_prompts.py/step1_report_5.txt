{
  "purpose": "The code defines prompt templates for an AI system to handle search query validation, enhancement, and retrieval tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in the form of {search_query} and {search} placeholders, which are intended to be replaced with user input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings containing the results or responses, but does not appear to process untrusted data beyond formatting responses.",
  "flows": "Input data ({search_query} or {search}) flows into the system, which then returns formatted output, such as validation results, enhanced queries, or search results.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains regex patterns for validating and extracting data, but no malicious or suspicious code such as dynamic execution or network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily template definitions for prompt interactions with an AI. It enforces strict output formats and uses regex for input validation and extraction. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The design appears to be for controlled prompt formatting and validation, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of prompt templates for AI interactions related to search queries. It does not exhibit any malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. It is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
