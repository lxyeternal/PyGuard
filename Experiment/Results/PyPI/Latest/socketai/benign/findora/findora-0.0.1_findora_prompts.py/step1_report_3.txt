{
  "purpose": "Defines prompt templates for user interaction and system responses related to search query validation, enhancement, and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Prompt template strings containing system instructions and user input placeholders",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or processing that could lead to security issues; templates are static",
  "flows": "User input ({search_query}, {search}) is inserted into prompt templates; responses are formatted according to patterns",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns for validation and extraction; no suspicious code behavior or data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines static prompt templates for a conversational AI system. It specifies system instructions and user input patterns for validation, enhancement, and search result formatting. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling occurs. Patterns are used solely for parsing specific inputs or formatting outputs, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining prompt templates for an AI system and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially harmful operations.",
