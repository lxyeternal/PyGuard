  "purpose": "The code defines a set of prompt templates for a conversational AI system to process search-related queries and responses, including validation, enhancement, and retrieval of search results.",
  "sources": "Prompt templates, including system instructions, user input, regex patterns, and response formatting instructions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain active data processing, data sinks, or any handling of untrusted data within execution; it only specifies static templates.",
  "flows": "User inputs are intended to be inserted into templates for validation, enhancement, or search; responses are formatted accordingly. No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present within this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears to be straightforward template definitions for an AI prompt system.",
  "analysis": "The code provides predefined prompt templates with regex patterns for matching user input and formatted response templates for search-related functionalities. There are no executable code blocks, no data handling, or network operations. All patterns and instructions are static and intended for prompt formatting only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a static set of prompt templates for an AI system and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and designed for prompt formatting and template management.",
