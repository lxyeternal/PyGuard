  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe static prompt templates with regex patterns and formatted output instructions.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling beyond string formatting.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is safe, static, and free of malicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets do not contain executable logic, code injection, or dynamic behaviors.\n- Regex patterns are straightforward and used solely for validation or extraction.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose across reports is uniformly about defining prompt templates for an AI system.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No claims are made that are based on assumptions; all findings are cautious and based on static analysis.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Since the code is purely static prompt templates, I agree with the assigned scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- The risk score should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, static, and intended solely for prompt formatting.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The overall security posture is sound.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious code or behavior)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, static prompt templates with no security concerns.",
