  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as static prompt templates with regex patterns, system instructions, and response formatting.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling is mentioned.\n- The code appears to be purely static, intended for prompt management in an AI system.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the description.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the static nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any actual executable logic, only templates and regex patterns.\n- The regex patterns are straightforward, used for input validation and extraction.\n- The prompts enforce strict output formats, reducing risk of injection or malicious output.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity or intent described.\n- **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, static templates with no active processing or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is safe, static, and intended solely for prompt formatting and validation.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a static set of prompt templates with regex validation, designed for an AI system. It poses no security or malware risks.",
