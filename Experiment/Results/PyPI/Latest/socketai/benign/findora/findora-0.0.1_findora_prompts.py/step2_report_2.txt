  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a static set of prompt templates, regex patterns, and formatting instructions for an AI system handling search query validation, enhancement, and search result formatting.\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely static, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling beyond string formatting and regex parsing.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified across all reports.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain executable logic, dynamic code, or network operations.\n- The regex patterns are straightforward and only used for input validation or extraction.\n- The templates are static, hardcoded strings with no embedded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- The reports' conclusions about safety and lack of malicious intent are consistent with the code content.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- No issues are apparent; the code is well-structured for its purpose.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed to the scores or assessments.\n- The risk score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The malware score should stay at 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code is purely static prompt templates and regex patterns.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The detailed reports support this conclusion.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| malware            | 0      |\n| obfuscated         | 0      |\n| securityRisk       | 0      |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and should be maintained.",
