{
  "purpose": "The code defines structured prompts for a conversational AI to perform search query validation, enhancement, and retrieval, guiding the AI to respond in specific formats.",
  "sources": "Prompt templates and pattern definitions for regular expressions used to validate and parse user input and AI responses.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code does not process or execute untrusted data, only defines prompt templates and regex patterns.",
  "flows": "User input is matched against regex patterns; the AI's output is constrained to specific XML-like formats; no data flows that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; patterns and prompts are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration of prompt templates and regex patterns for guiding an AI in search query validation and enhancement tasks. There are no data processing, execution, or data flow mechanisms that could be exploited. The structure is consistent with intent for prompt management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, setting up prompts and regex patterns for an AI assistant. It does not contain executable logic or data handling that could be malicious. No security concerns identified.",
