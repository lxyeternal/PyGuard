  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of static prompt templates, regex patterns, and formatting instructions.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing logic are present.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is static, well-structured, and intended for prompt management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that there are no suspicious behaviors, no anomalies, and no malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as static prompt templates with regex validation.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary unless new evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, and the code is static, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The highest risk here is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Regex patterns are used solely for input validation and extraction.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n   - Malware score remains at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are supported by the static nature of the code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly state the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the code's static, non-malicious design.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a static set of prompt templates for an AI system.\n- No security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n- The code is safe for deployment as a prompt configuration.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the static, benign nature of the code and the comprehensive analysis provided.",
