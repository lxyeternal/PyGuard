{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'findora' to perform a document search based on a user query, enhancing the query if needed, and retrieving relevant search results using a language model and prompt templates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'search_query', environment variables or external files for 'prompts' and 'llmatch' (from imported modules). It reads 'search_query' from user input and data from prompt templates.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not write or transmit untrusted data outside of function scope. It processes and returns data internally.",
  "flows": "User provides 'search_query' -> 'llmatch' validates and enhances query -> 'llmatch' performs search and retrieves results -> regex extracts URLs and titles -> results compiled and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on imported modules; no obfuscated or malicious code present. The 'max_retries' parameter set to 100, which is high but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a language model for validating and enhancing search queries, then performs a regex-based extraction of search results. It performs input validation on query length, checks validity via an 'llmatch' call, and optionally enhances the query. Results are deduplicated by URL. No external network calls, file manipulations, or suspicious operations detected. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate search helper function that validates and enhances queries before performing a search. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It relies on external modules for core functionality but within this code snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
