{
  "purpose": "Provides inference utilities for loading data, converting to tensors, and running models with optional custom output converters.",
  "sources": "File system reads (for model files and audio files), data inputs (numbers, tensors, bytes, file paths), environment variables are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "torch.load potentially executing code during model loading, file reads for audio and model files, tensor conversions.",
  "flows": "Input data → _raw_to_tensor → model(*tensors) → _convert → output",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no hidden backdoors, standard use of torch.load which can execute arbitrary code if model is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ML inference utility supporting audio data loading, tensor conversion, and model inference. The primary security concern is the use of torch.load, which can execute malicious code if the model file is compromised. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The deserialization process is a known supply chain risk but not malicious in itself. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The potential for malicious activity depends on external model files, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk arises from loading untrusted models via torch.load, which can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk to a moderate level (~0.5) reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Proper validation or sandboxing of model files is recommended in deployment scenarios.",
