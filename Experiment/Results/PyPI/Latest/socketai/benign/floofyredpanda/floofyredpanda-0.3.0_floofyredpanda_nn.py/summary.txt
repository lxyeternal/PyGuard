  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk arises from loading untrusted models via torch.load, which can execute arbitrary code. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk to a moderate level (~0.5) reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Proper validation or sandboxing of model files is recommended in deployment scenarios."
