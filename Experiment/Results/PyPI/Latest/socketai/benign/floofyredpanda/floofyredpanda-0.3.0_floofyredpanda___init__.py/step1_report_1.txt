{
  "purpose": "Defines package version and imports modules related to neural networks and training.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment, and the imported modules 'nn' and 'train' along with 'register_output_converter'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicate untrusted data handling, user input, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and imports specific components from local modules. There is no evidence of data processing, external communication, or suspicious operations. The imports appear standard for a machine learning library, and the version string is typical metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward module setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines version information and imports modules relevant to neural network training.",
