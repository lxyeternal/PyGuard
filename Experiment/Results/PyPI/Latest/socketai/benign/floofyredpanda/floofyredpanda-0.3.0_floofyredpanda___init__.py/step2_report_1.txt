  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the corresponding code snippets.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code snippets are simple module initializations, setting a version string and importing internal modules.\n- No external data handling, user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning maximum confidence (1) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code does not contain any issues or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as standard package setup code.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score Validity:\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0  \n  These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential for score adjustment:**  \n  Since the code is straightforward and safe, scores are justified as-is.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- **Any higher scores?**  \n  No. The code shows no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The risk scores are correctly set to zero.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- **Malware detection?**  \n  None. The code is purely structural, with no malicious payloads or suspicious operations.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid speculative claims. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- **Scores are consistent** across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is standard initialization code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the risk is minimal.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores as-is: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No further action needed.",
