{
  "purpose": "Module initialization defining version and importing core functionalities related to neural networks and training.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink operations involving untrusted data or external communications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only internal module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports specific functions from internal modules '.nn' and '.train'. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The import statements are typical for package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic version assignment and imports core modules for neural network operations and training.",
