  "purpose": "Package initialization code setting version and importing internal modules",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__, imports from .nn and .train modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Version string assignment and module imports; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and imports specific functions from internal modules, typical for a Python package's __init__.py. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leaks are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, aligning with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.",
