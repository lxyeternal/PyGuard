{
  "purpose": "This code implements a neural network training routine using PyTorch, processing input data through an external utility function, and training a configurable feed-forward model.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the raw_inputs and raw_outputs parameters, processed via the external function _raw_to_tensor.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data externally or communicate over networks; untrusted data could potentially influence the model if _raw_to_tensor is malicious, but no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from raw_inputs/raw_outputs through _raw_to_tensor to tensors X and Y, then into the model for training, with no external data leaks or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The only external dependency is _raw_to_tensor, whose implementation is unknown; no other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard neural network training script that converts inputs to tensors, constructs a model based on specified layers and activation, and trains it with MSE loss. The main point of uncertainty is the external function _raw_to_tensor, which could be benign or malicious. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The malware score is justified as 0 due to the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the unknown utility function but no evidence of malicious intent. Confidence is high that the code is benign, assuming _raw_to_tensor is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard ML training routine with no malicious or sabotage behavior. The only potential concern is the external _raw_to_tensor function, which should be reviewed if possible, but based on current evidence, the code is safe.",
