{
  "purpose": "The code trains a simple feed-forward neural network model using provided input and output data, with configurable layers, activation functions, and training parameters.",
  "sources": "raw_inputs and raw_outputs (function arguments), which are processed via _raw_to_tensor() for input data; the _raw_to_tensor() function (imported from a local module) may read from files, bytes, or other sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted and stacked into tensors; the model training involves standard data flow, with data passed into model.predict() and loss computed via MSELoss. No data is written to external locations or transmitted over network in this code.",
  "flows": "raw_inputs/raw_outputs -> _raw_to_tensor() -> tensor conversion -> DataLoader -> model training (forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation) -> model is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The _raw_to_tensor() function's behavior is unknown, which could be a concern if it performs unsafe operations, but based on this code, its usage appears standard. No code injection, data leaks, or network communications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard training pipeline for a neural network with configurable parameters. It uses safe PyTorch operations, processes data into tensors, and performs training within a controlled loop. No suspicious behavior or malicious code segments are evident. The only external dependency, _raw_to_tensor(), is imported locally; its implementation is unknown but presumed safe. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious file operations are observed. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for model training.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard neural network training script with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The use of _raw_to_tensor() could warrant further review if its implementation is suspicious, but based on this snippet alone, it is likely safe.",
