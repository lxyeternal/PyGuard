{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to train a simple feed-forward neural network model on provided input-output data, with configurable layers, activation function, learning rate, and training epochs.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'raw_inputs' and 'raw_outputs' parameters, which can be lists of numbers, lists, file paths, or bytes, processed via the '_raw_to_tensor' function. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code performs tensor conversions, model training, and prints training loss per epoch. There are no data leaks, network communications, or file writes involved that would be suspicious.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'raw_inputs' and 'raw_outputs' into '_raw_to_tensor' functions, then into tensors, which are processed by the model during training. No external sinks or untrusted output channels are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard model training procedures with typical PyTorch operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a training function that converts raw data into tensors, builds a neural network model, and trains it using Adam optimizer and MSE loss. The data handling, model creation, and training steps are typical. The only noteworthy aspect is the '_raw_to_tensor' function, which is imported from a relative module; its implementation is unknown, but its usage appears standard. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be legitimate, focusing on model training.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for training a neural network with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a normal training script that uses typical PyTorch practices. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
