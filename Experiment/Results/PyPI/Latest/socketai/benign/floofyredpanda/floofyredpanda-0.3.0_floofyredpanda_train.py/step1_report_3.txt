{
  "purpose": "The code trains a simple feed-forward neural network using user-provided inputs and outputs, with customizable layers and activation functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from raw_inputs and raw_outputs parameters, which are processed by the _raw_to_tensor function, likely converting various input formats into tensors.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in tensors and used for model training; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are evident, but the code involves data conversion and model training routines.",
  "flows": "Input data from raw_inputs/raw_outputs -> _raw_to_tensor conversion -> tensors (X, Y) -> model training with optimizer and loss calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of _raw_to_tensor could be a point of concern if it performs unsafe operations, but its implementation isn't provided. The print statement in the training loop outputs loss per epoch, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a neural network training routine with standard practices: data conversion, model construction, training loop, loss calculation, and optimization. The use of _raw_to_tensor is a potential source of concern if it performs unsafe conversions, but this cannot be determined without its implementation. There are no network communications, system modifications, or data exfiltration activities visible. The code appears to be a typical ML training script with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard neural network training implementation without any clear malicious behavior or malicious payloads. No suspicious data handling or harmful operations are observed. The only minor concern is the unspecified _raw_to_tensor function, which could potentially introduce risk if malicious, but this cannot be assessed from provided code.",
