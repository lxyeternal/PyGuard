{
  "purpose": "Train a simple feed-forward neural network model using provided inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "raw_inputs and raw_outputs parameters; data read from these inputs, passed into _raw_to_tensor for conversion.",
  "sinks": "Model training steps; loss computation, optimizer updates, and potential print statements.",
  "flows": "raw_inputs/raw_outputs -> _raw_to_tensor -> torch tensors -> model training loop.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for loss output during training; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious file access; no evident data leaks or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data conversion, model creation, training loop with loss calculation, and optimizer steps. No unusual code patterns, no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. Usage of _raw_to_tensor depends on its implementation but is assumed benign since it’s imported from a local module. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. No signs of malicious intent or data exfiltration are visible. The print statement is for progress reporting and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward neural network training script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
