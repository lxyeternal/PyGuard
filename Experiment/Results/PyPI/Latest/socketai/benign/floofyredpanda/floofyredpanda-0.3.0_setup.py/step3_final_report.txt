  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, reading local README.md for long description, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, static dependency declarations in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data processing beyond reading a local file.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' into long_description variable; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file for description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and sets package metadata. It does not execute dynamic code, perform network operations, or handle user input. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. All dependencies are standard, and the code structure is conventional. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
