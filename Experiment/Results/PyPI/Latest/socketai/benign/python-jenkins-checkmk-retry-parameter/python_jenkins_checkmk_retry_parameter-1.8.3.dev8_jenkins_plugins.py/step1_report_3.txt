  "purpose": "Define classes for managing and comparing Jenkins plugin versions, including legacy version parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for operator and re modules; version parsing regex patterns; class initializers and methods.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is sent or written to external sources, no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; code performs internal version parsing and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated logic. Use of regex and class inheritance appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for plugin metadata management and version comparison, including legacy version handling. It imports standard modules, uses regex for version parsing, and implements comparison operators. No external data input, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing solely on internal version logic without any suspicious operations or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of version comparison classes for Jenkins plugins, including legacy support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. It appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
