  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for managing and comparing Jenkins plugin versions with custom version parsing and comparison logic.",
  "sources": "None; the code is primarily class and function definitions, with version strings as input.",
  "sinks": "None; no direct data leaks, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process external untrusted data through source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to implement version parsing and comparison logic without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and comparison methods for plugin versioning, including regular expressions and custom comparison logic. It processes version strings internally without external input or network communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code does not perform any I/O operations, network requests, or execute external commands. The version parsing and comparison mechanisms are standard for handling software version strings, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of version comparison logic with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely handles version parsing and comparison for Jenkins plugins, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
