  "purpose": "To define and retrieve version information for the 'jenkins' project using the pbr library.",
  "sources": "Importing pbr.version and accessing pbr.version.VersionInfo('jenkins')",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the version_info object could be used in ways that expose internal version data, but no direct sink for untrusted data or malicious behavior is present.",
  "flows": "Import of pbr.version -> creation of VersionInfo object with 'jenkins' -> potential use of version_info object in the application (not shown here)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code follows standard versioning practices. The file contains license headers and a straightforward version info assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known versioning library (pbr), assigns version information to a variable, and contains only licensing comments. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for version management in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version info assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical, benign snippet used for version tracking in a project.",
