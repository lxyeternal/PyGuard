The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the minimal concern about reading 'README.md'. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation. No adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion of malicious intent. No definitive malicious payloads are identified, but the presence of eval/exec warrants cautious scoring. Overall, the security risk is moderate, with the highest concern centered on dynamic code constructs. The scores are generally consistent with the analyses, with a minor suggestion to slightly increase the malware score for better alignment."
