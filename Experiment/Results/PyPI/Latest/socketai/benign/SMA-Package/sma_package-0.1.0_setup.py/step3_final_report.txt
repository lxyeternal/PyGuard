  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to populate 'long_description'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into 'long_description' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; placeholder email is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It reads a static file for description, with no dynamic or network activity. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The placeholder email and URL are typical in sample code. The minimal security risk stems from reading 'README.md', which could contain sensitive info, but this is a common practice and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no malicious intent or security threats. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the minimal concern about reading 'README.md'. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation. No adjustments are necessary.",
