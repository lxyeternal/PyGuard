{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, intended for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' via open('README.md').read().",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak if 'README.md' contains sensitive information; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'long_description' flows from reading 'README.md' into the setup configuration; no other flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration. It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, reads the long description from a file, and specifies dependencies and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md', which could contain sensitive info if misused, but this is common practice in setup scripts. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
