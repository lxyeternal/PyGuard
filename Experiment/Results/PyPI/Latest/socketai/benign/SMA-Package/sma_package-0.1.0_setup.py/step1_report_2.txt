  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read operations on 'README.md' for long description; static string assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data is used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads 'README.md' for long description, which is a common pattern. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No anomalies or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
