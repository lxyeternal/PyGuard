  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> pass content to long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to package a Python project, with typical metadata and no signs of malicious code. The only potentially risky part is reading the README.md file, which is a common practice and not inherently dangerous. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data flows, and no code that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
