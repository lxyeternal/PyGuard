  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors in any of the snippets.\n   - The code is standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No risk scores need to be elevated.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's straightforward behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a simple version string assignment, a common and benign pattern. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' assessments and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
