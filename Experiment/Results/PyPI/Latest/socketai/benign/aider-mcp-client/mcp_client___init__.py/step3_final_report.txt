  "purpose": "Define the package version as a simple string assignment.",

  "sinks": "None; the code does not write output or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string to __version__, a common practice for versioning in Python packages. It contains no input/output, control flow, or external data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity and standard nature of this code indicate it is benign and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
