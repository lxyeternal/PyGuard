  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only a version string assignment, no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify versioning. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or obfuscation present. The simplicity suggests standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version string assignment with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns.",
