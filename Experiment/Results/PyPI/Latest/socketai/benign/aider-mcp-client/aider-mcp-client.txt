      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward MCP client for documentation retrieval. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is external command execution if configuration files are maliciously altered, but defaults mitigate this risk. Overall, the code is safe for typical use with low security risk."
