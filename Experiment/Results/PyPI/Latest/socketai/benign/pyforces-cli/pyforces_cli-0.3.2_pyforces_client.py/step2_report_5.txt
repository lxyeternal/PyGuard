  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears to be a legitimate web client for interacting with Codeforces, supporting session management, problem parsing, submissions, and data extraction.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code segments are present.\n   - The code relies on external files for headers and tokens, which is standard for such automation tools.\n   - The network interactions (GET/POST requests) and HTML parsing functions are typical for web automation.\n   - Commented-out code involving `os.urandom` is benign and unused; it suggests potential future features but currently does not pose a risk.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a standard, legitimate client for Codeforces.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n   - They acknowledge the use of external files for session data, which is normal.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning; the analysis aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for such tools)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The low security risk score (0.2) reflects the standard use of external files and web requests without any malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's apparent functionality and security posture.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a legitimate automation client.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified by the detailed reasoning.\n   - The high confidence levels (0.9-0.95) further support the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured client for automating interactions with Codeforces. It handles session tokens, headers, and submissions securely and without malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malware signatures are present. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal security concern associated with such automation tools, which are common and generally safe when used responsibly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, the code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose a security threat. The current scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
