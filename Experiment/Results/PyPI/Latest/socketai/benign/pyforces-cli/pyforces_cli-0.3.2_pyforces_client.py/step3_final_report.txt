  "purpose": "A web client for interacting with Codeforces, handling login, problem parsing, submissions, and contest data extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads headers and CSRF tokens from external files, network requests to Codeforces URLs, HTML parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network requests for submission and data retrieval, reading/writing configuration files.",
  "flows": "External files (headers, tokens) -> HTTP requests -> HTML parsing -> data extraction or submission responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; commented os.urandom lines are benign; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate automation client for Codeforces, with standard practices for session management, data parsing, and submission. It reads tokens and headers from external files, performs network requests, and parses HTML responses. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear. The commented-out os.urandom lines are harmless and unused. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client for Codeforces automation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
