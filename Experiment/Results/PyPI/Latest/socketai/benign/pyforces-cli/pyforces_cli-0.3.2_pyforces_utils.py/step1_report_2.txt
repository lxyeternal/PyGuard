{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, and file management related to a contest problem environment.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`input()`) reading user input; `glob.glob()` reading filesystem for `.cpp` files; `Path.cwd()` accessing current directory; `headers` argument in `parse_firefox_http_headers` for header data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable code where user input is converted to integers or booleans without validation (`input()` functions); filesystem access in `get_current_cpp_file()`; parsing of headers in `parse_firefox_http_headers()`.",
  "flows": "User input flows from `input()` calls to subsequent control logic; header data from external source passed into `parse_firefox_http_headers()` and then processed; filesystem files are read via `glob.glob()` and their paths returned.",
  "anomalies": "The `parse_firefox_http_headers()` function assumes a specific nested structure in headers which could lead to errors if input is malformed, but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward utility functions with typical patterns for input handling, header parsing, and filesystem operations. The header parsing function expects a specific nested structure, which could cause errors but does not pose security threats. User input functions handle prompts and return booleans or indices, with minimal validation. The filesystem function searches for `.cpp` files, returning the path if exactly one is found, otherwise printing warnings. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. No evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code appears benign and consistent with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs utility operations such as user prompts, header parsing, and file discovery without harmful behavior. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
