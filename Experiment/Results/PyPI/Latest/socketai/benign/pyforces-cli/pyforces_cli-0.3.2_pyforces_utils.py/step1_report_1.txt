{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, and file handling, likely used in a coding contest or automation tool.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function, current working directory via Path.cwd(), glob for filename matching, headers dictionary input to parse_firefox_http_headers().",
  "sinks": "Input functions that accept untrusted data (user input), parse_firefox_http_headers() that processes external headers, get_current_cpp_file() that accesses the filesystem.",
  "flows": "User inputs (via input()) flow into control logic for validation, headers dictionary flow into parsing function, filesystem data flow from glob and Path into the return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code, no network activity, no cryptomining, or data exfiltration observed. The code includes simple input validation and filesystem access without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, header parsing, and filesystem queries with standard Python libraries. The input functions properly handle user input, the header parser extracts headers from a dictionary, and the file handler searches for C++ files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hidden or malicious side-effects are evident. The code appears to be part of a utility or helper module for a larger application, with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing routine user interaction, header processing, and file handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to be a safe utility script with no malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior.",
