{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, header parsing, and file handling, likely used in a coding contest or script environment.",
  "sources": "Input functions (`input()`) reading user responses, `glob.glob()` reading filesystem for cpp files, `Path.cwd()` accessing current directory path, `headers` dictionary parameter in `parse_firefox_http_headers()`.",
  "sinks": "User input validation and prompts, printing error messages, returning file paths, and manipulating headers. No data is sent over the network or written to files by this code itself.",
  "flows": "User inputs are validated and returned; headers are processed from an input dictionary; current directory info is extracted; file list is obtained and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Functions operate in expected ways. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions: prompting user input with validation, parsing headers from a nested dictionary, retrieving contest/problem identifiers from directory structure, and locating C++ source files in the current directory. The functions include basic assertions, input validation, and file handling, all typical and safe operations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and designed for general utility in a development or contest environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious backdoors, or security risks. All operations are straightforward and safe.",
