  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-oriented, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor assumption in header parsing does not pose security risks but could be improved for robustness. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential issues but no actual threats."
