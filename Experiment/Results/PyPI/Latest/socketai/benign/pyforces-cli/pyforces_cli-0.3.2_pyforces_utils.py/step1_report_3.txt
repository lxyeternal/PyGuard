  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, and file detection in a programming contest environment.",
  "sources": "Reading input from the user (input()), reading header values from a dictionary argument, listing files in the current directory using glob.glob.",
  "sinks": "Input functions could potentially process untrusted user input; parsing headers involves untrusted data; file detection reads directory contents which could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into input_index and input_y_or_n; untrusted headers flow into parse_firefox_http_headers; directory listing flows into get_current_cpp_file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard input/output and file listing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for user prompts, header parsing, and file detection. The input functions process untrusted user input but do not execute it or transmit it. The header parsing function extracts headers from a provided dictionary, which could be manipulated if the input is malicious, but this is standard data handling. The file detection function lists files with a specific extension, which is common and safe; no code injection or malicious behavior is evident. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate utility purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for user interaction, header processing, and file detection within a development or contest environment. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
