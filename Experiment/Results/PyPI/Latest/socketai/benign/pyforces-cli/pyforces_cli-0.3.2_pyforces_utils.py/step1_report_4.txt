{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for user input, header parsing, and file handling, likely for use in a larger application related to contest problems and HTTP headers.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via input(), reads current directory structure via Path.cwd() and glob.glob(), and processes headers passed as a dictionary parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs prompts via input() and print(), processes headers, and returns data; no direct sink appears to be malicious or insecure. No data is written to external locations or transmitted.",
  "flows": "User inputs are read and validated; headers are parsed from a dictionary; current directory is inspected for specific files; outputs are printed or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward with typical input validation and directory/file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises functions for user interaction, header parsing, and file detection. Input functions do not handle untrusted data beyond user prompts. Header parsing assumes a specific structure but does not execute untrusted code. Directory and file handling are safe, relying on glob and pathlib. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, designed for utility within a larger application. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The functions perform expected operations with no evident security risks.",
