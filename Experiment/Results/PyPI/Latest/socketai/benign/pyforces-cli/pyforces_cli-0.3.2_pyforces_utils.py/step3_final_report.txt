  "purpose": "Utility functions for user input, HTTP header parsing, contest problem ID extraction, and C++ file detection.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, headers dictionary, current working directory path, filesystem glob for *.cpp files.",
  "sinks": "Input validation in input_index and input_y_or_n functions, header dictionary construction, filesystem path handling.",
  "flows": "User input flows into validation loops; headers values are processed to extract headers; filesystem glob results are used to identify files.",
  "anomalies": "Assumption of specific nested structure in parse_firefox_http_headers which could cause runtime errors if structure differs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign utility operations with minimal validation, handling untrusted data in a standard manner. Header parsing assumes a specific structure but does not execute code or perform dangerous operations. Filesystem access is limited to listing and returning a single .cpp file. User input functions validate input but do not sanitize beyond validation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The overall design is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-oriented, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor assumption in header parsing does not pose security risks but could be improved for robustness. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential issues but no actual threats.",
