  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets and the context provided.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions: user input prompts, HTTP header parsing, current contest problem ID extraction, and C++ file detection.\n- All reports agree that the code performs standard operations with no malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The functions handle untrusted data (user input, headers, filesystem) but do so in a benign manner.\n- The header parsing assumes a specific structure but does not execute code or perform dangerous operations.\n- The filesystem access is limited to listing files with `.cpp` extension and returning paths.\n\n**Review of specific points:**\n\n1. **Malicious Behavior & Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n2. **Obfuscation Score:**\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n\n3. **Security Risk & Risk Score:**\n   - The highest risk score is 0.2, assigned in report 2, due to potential unvalidated input handling.\n   - Given the code's nature, these risks are minimal; the functions are simple and do not perform dangerous operations.\n   - The overall security risk remains low, and the risk scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Flow & Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that user inputs are validated minimally (e.g., index within range, y/n responses).\n   - The header parsing function assumes a specific nested structure, which could cause errors if malformed, but does not pose a security threat.\n   - Files are listed and returned only if exactly one `.cpp` file is found, otherwise warnings are printed.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - The analysis correctly notes that no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Conclusion & my assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, utility-oriented, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The assigned scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The only minor concern is the header parsing function's assumption about structure, but it doesn't translate into security issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to unvalidated user input and assumptions in header parsing, but overall very low)\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, and no significant security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect               | Recommended Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware              | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated           | 0                   | Code is straightforward and readable                        |\n| Security Risk        | 0.1 - 0.2           | Minor risk from unvalidated inputs, but overall very low  |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and suitable for its utility purpose.**",
