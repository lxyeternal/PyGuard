  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations Across All Reports:\n- The code comprises utility functions: user input prompts, HTTP header parsing, current contest problem ID extraction, and C++ file detection.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- The functions handle untrusted data (user input, headers, filesystem info) but do so in a standard, benign manner.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, performing routine utility functions.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues found. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with minor note that `parse_firefox_http_headers()` assumes a specific nested structure which could cause errors but not maliciousness.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=0.9`\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to potential errors if headers are malformed, but no malicious activity. The score seems reasonable, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same functions, with emphasis on untrusted user input and filesystem access. No malicious code.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=0.9`\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The low security risk score matches the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with standard operations, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=0.9`\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, reflecting minimal to no security risk, which aligns with the code's operations.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1) or near (0.9), justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — The code is benign, with negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The header parsing function assumes a specific nested structure; while not malicious, it could cause runtime errors if the structure differs. This is a non-security concern but could be flagged for robustness.\n- User input functions do not sanitize inputs beyond validation, but since they are prompts, this is acceptable.\n- Filesystem access is safe, with no code injection risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final Recommended Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the code's safe, utility-oriented nature.",
