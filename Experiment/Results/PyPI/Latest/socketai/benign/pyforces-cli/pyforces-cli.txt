The minor assumption in header parsing does not pose security risks but could be improved for robustness. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential issues but no actual threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risks. It functions as a simple parser wrapper, depending on external functions that are assumed to be secure. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward HTML parser with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on regex and assumptions about HTML structure. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use without security concerns."

The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature."
