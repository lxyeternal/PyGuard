{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse various elements from HTML content related to test cases, user handles, CSRF tokens, countdown timers, problem counts, submission IDs, verdicts, and metadata such as 'cc' and 'pc' values.",
  "sources": "HTML content provided as input to functions; regex searches and XPath queries within the HTML content.",
  "sinks": "Extraction points where untrusted data is returned (e.g., regex matches, XPath results). No code writes or transmits data; functions simply parse and return values.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows through parsing functions; regex and XPath extract data, which is then returned or used within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for parsing JavaScript variables and meta tags, but no evident obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques. Logging errors on missing sample-divs and countdown divs is benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs HTML parsing and data extraction via standard libraries (lxml, re). It extracts test case data, user handles, CSRF tokens, countdown timers, problem counts, submission IDs, verdicts, and metadata. The use of regex to extract handle and tokens is typical for HTML parsing. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration is present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic is detected. The functions are straightforward, and all input handling is limited to parsing and returning data without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It handles untrusted HTML input safely by parsing and extracting data without executing code or transmitting data externally.",
