  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward HTML parser with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on regex and assumptions about HTML structure. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use without security concerns."
