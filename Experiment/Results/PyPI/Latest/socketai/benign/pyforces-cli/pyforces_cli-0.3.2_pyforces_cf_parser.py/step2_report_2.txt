  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard HTML parsing, extracting test cases, handle, CSRF token, countdown, problem count, submission ID, verdict, and metadata. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the benign nature described. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on safe parsing. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The very low risk score matches the benign analysis. Malware score remains justified at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard parsing with no malicious intent. Use of regex is typical; no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified given the benign description.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that regex extraction of sensitive data could be risky if HTML is manipulated. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is slightly higher but still low, considering potential risks if input HTML is maliciously crafted. No actual malicious behavior is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring reflects a cautious approach, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The zero risk and malware scores are justified given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect cautiousness about regex-based extraction, which could be brittle or risky if input HTML is maliciously crafted. Given the code's benign behavior, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, but considering potential HTML manipulation, a small margin is justified.\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior. No significant security concerns or malicious activity are evident.",
