  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of HTML parsing functions that use `lxml` and regex to extract data.\n- No code writes, transmits, or executes untrusted data.\n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident.\n- The regex patterns are straightforward and used for data extraction.\n- Logging is benign and used for error reporting.\n- The functions are stateless and only parse and return data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues & Logical Flaws:\n\n- **Presence of issues or vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not identify any functional issues or security flaws. The code appears robust for its purpose.\n\n- **Potential points of concern:**  \n  The only minor concern is the reliance on regex patterns assuming specific HTML structures, which could break if the HTML changes, but this is standard in such parsers and not inherently insecure.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:\n\n- No significant logical errors are detected.  \n- The use of regex for extracting variables from HTML is common but can be brittle if the HTML structure changes, but this does not imply a security risk.\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk. This is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Overall risk:**  \n  The code is a standard parsing utility with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n\n- No assumptions about malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration are justified here.  \n- The code only extracts data; it does not execute or transmit it.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n\n- All reports are consistent in scoring, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and low security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and the reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2**  \n  Slightly above zero due to reliance on regex, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe HTML parsing utility. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, well-structured, and safe for its purpose. The scoring aligns with the analysis.",
