{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse specific data from HTML content, such as test cases, user handle, CSRF tokens, countdown timers, problem counts, submission IDs, verdicts, and metadata. It is designed for data extraction without executing or transmitting data.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML strings, uses XPath and regex to extract data from HTML elements and scripts.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write, transmit, or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input HTML -> regex/XPath extraction -> returned data; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious code patterns detected. Regex patterns assume specific HTML structures, which could be brittle but not insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard parsing techniques with lxml and regex for data extraction. It does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration. Error handling is limited to logging. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and target specific HTML elements or scripts. The functions are stateless and purely for data retrieval, making the code benign. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential brittleness if HTML structure changes, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward HTML parser with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to reliance on regex and assumptions about HTML structure. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use without security concerns.",
