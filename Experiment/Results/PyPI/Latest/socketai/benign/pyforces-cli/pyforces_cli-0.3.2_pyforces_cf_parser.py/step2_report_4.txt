  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of parsing functions that extract data from HTML content.\n- The methods use standard libraries (`lxml`, `re`) and straightforward logic.\n- No code writes or transmits data; no network or system commands.\n- Regex patterns target specific HTML structures, e.g., JavaScript variables, meta tags.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- Error handling is limited to logging, which is benign.\n- The functions are designed for data extraction only.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAccurate; the code is a standard parser with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to potential misparsing if HTML structure changes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's scores seem reasonable. The low security risk reflects the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAgain, the code performs standard parsing. The regex patterns are typical for extracting variables.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, given the functions are safe, but regex reliance on HTML structure could be brittle.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nSame as above; standard parsing, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 — consistent with minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nAgain, the code is a safe parser, with regex extracting tokens and data.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, considering regex for sensitive data, but still benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & analysis:**  \nSame as others; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minimal risk of parsing issues or HTML structure brittleness.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- Given the code's straightforward nature, I would assign a **malware score of 0** across the board, which is consistent.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain 0.\n- The **security risk** could be uniformly set at **0.1** to **0.2**, acknowledging regex reliance but recognizing no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final verdict:**\n\n**The reports' assessments are accurate and well-justified.** They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to regex dependence, but overall very low risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
