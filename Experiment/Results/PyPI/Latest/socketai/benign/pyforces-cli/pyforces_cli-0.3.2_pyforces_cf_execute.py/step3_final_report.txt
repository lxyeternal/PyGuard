{
  "purpose": "The code provides a sandbox environment to execute external programs with resource limits, monitor their resource usage, and compare their output to expected answers.",
  "sources": "Reads input from provided TextIO objects, executes external commands via subprocess or psutil, and reads output for comparison.",
  "sinks": "Outputs comparison results, process termination signals, and resource usage data; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into subprocess execution; output is captured and compared; resource monitoring data flows into logging and decision-making.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Resource tracking is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code executes external programs with resource constraints, monitors resource usage via psutil when polling, handles timeouts and errors, and compares output with normalization. It employs standard libraries and techniques, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Resource tracking is consistent, and error handling is appropriate. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure execution harness suitable for testing or sandboxing external programs. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
