{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for executing external programs with resource limits, comparing their output to expected answers, and reporting execution results.",
  "sources": "Reads input from TextIO objects, reads answer data from TextIO objects, imports 'psutil' and 'subprocess', uses environment variables for program commands.",
  "sinks": "Executes external commands via subprocess or psutil.Popen, reads stdout and stderr of processes, kills processes on timeout or exceeding memory/time limits.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into subprocess commands; output is captured from subprocess stdout; process management via psutil or subprocess.run; output comparison determines pass/fail.",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern in dynamic execution: importing 'psutil' only if poll=True, but this is standard; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code present; resource limits are set via parameters, not via suspicious manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs process execution with resource tracking, comparing outputs, and handling errors. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident. The only noteworthy aspect is the optional use of 'psutil' for resource monitoring, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The code does execute external commands, but this is typical for such a task. No obfuscated code or misleading variables are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a program executor for testing purposes, with resource limits and output comparison. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. The implementation seems legitimate and safe.",
