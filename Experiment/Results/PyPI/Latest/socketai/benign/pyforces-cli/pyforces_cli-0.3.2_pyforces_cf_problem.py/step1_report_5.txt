{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing a programming problem from Codeforces, including parsing test cases from HTML content fetched via a web parser function.",
  "sources": "web_parser function (passed as argument to parse_from_url), parse_testcases_from_html function, url parameter",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flow leads to sensitive sinks such as network, file system, or environment manipulation",
  "flows": "url and web_parser -> parse_testcases_from_html -> testcases list; url used in parse_from_url, web_parser called with url",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard data parsing, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and methods to parse test cases from a given URL using an external HTML parser. The web_parser function is user-supplied, but there are no inherent malicious behaviors. The parse_testcases_from_html function is imported from an external module, and the code only uses its output. The method sets default problem type and limits, with no dynamic or sensitive operations. No code injection, data leaks, or network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class with parsing capability. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in the provided code fragment.",
