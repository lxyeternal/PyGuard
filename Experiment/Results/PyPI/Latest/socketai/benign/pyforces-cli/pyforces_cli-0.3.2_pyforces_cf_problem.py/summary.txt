  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risks. It functions as a simple parser wrapper, depending on external functions that are assumed to be secure. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
