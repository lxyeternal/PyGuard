  "purpose": "Define a class for representing a Codeforces problem with methods to parse testcases from a URL",
  "sources": "web_parser argument in parse_from_url method, parse_testcases_from_html function",
  "sink": "None observed; no untrusted data being written or executed",
  "flows": "web_parser(url) -> parse_testcases_from_html -> testcases list -> cls() instantiation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded default values for time and memory limits are not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines classes for representing programming problems. It utilizes an external parsing function 'parse_testcases_from_html' to extract test cases from HTML content fetched via a user-supplied web_parser function. The web_parser is a callable passed at runtime, which can be controlled externally, but in normal use, it is a dependency injection pattern, not malicious. The class methods are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations within the code, or data leaks. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for problem parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a problem parser with dependency injection for web content retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on external, controlled functions to fetch HTML, and no risky operations are present within this module.",
