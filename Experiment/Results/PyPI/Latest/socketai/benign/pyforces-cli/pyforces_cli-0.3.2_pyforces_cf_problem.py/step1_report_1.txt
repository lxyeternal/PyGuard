  "purpose": "Define a class for representing Codeforces problems, including parsing test cases from a URL",
  "sources": "web_parser function passed as argument, parse_testcases_from_html call with URL data",
  "sinks": "Potential use of web_parser and parse_testcases_from_html; no direct sinks for untrusted data",
  "flows": "web_parser(url) -> parse_testcases_from_html -> return cls(...)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no external data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and methods for parsing problem data from a URL. It uses external functions (web_parser and parse_testcases_from_html) to retrieve data. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The only external data source is the provided URL, and the functions involved are standard parsing functions without malicious intent. No untrusted data is being used in insecure ways, and the overall code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, standard implementation for parsing Codeforces problems. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks within this snippet.",
