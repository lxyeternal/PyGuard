  "purpose": "Define a class representing a Codeforces problem with methods to parse test cases from a given URL.",
  "sources": "The URL input and the web_parser callable used in parse_from_url method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential concern if web_parser returns malicious HTML or if the URL is untrusted and used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "URL and web_parser input flow into parse_testcases_from_html, which processes HTML to extract testcases.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of external parser is typical; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and classes to represent problems and parse test cases from a URL. The parse_from_url class method accepts a URL and a callable web_parser, then calls parse_testcases_from_html with the HTML returned by web_parser. There are no evident malicious code snippets, no network operations beyond the parser, and no suspicious data handling. The only potential concern is the reliance on external input (the URL and parser) which is standard for such modules. No data leakage or harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for parsing problem test cases from a URL with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It depends on the external web_parser function, but this is typical and not inherently malicious.",
