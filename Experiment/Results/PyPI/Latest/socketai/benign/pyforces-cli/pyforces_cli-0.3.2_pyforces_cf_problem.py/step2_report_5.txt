  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines an enum `ProblemType` and a class `CFProblem`.\n   - The class includes a method `parse_from_url` which takes a URL and a `web_parser` callable.\n   - Inside `parse_from_url`, it calls `web_parser(url)` to fetch HTML content, then passes that to `parse_testcases_from_html`.\n   - It constructs a `CFProblem` instance with default values for `problem_type`, `time_limit`, and `memory_limit`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious operations.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Analysis:**\n   - The external functions `web_parser` and `parse_testcases_from_html` are used as black boxes; their implementations are not shown.\n   - The code relies on external inputs (URL and parser), which is standard for such utilities.\n   - No network operations are performed directly within this code besides calling `web_parser`.\n   - No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any file I/O, network calls itself, or execute untrusted data.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is standard, with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - They mention the reliance on external functions but consider this normal and not malicious.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9-1), indicating that the reviewers agree on the safety.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All assign very low values (~0.1), reflecting minimal security risk. Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Overlooked Risks:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if `web_parser` is malicious or untrusted, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n   - The code does not validate the URL or the content fetched, but this is typical for such utility code; validation would be handled elsewhere if needed.\n   - No evidence of supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code appears safe, standard, and free from malware.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No modifications are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports; minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward utility for parsing Codeforces problems. It uses external functions responsibly, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
