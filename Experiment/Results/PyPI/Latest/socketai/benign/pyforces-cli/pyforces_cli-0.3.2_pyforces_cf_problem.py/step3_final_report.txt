{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to represent Codeforces problems and provides a method to parse problem data from a URL using external parsing functions.",
  "sources": "The URL input, the web_parser callable, and the external parse_testcases_from_html function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows within this code; relies on external functions for data fetching and parsing.",
  "flows": "Input URL and web_parser -> fetch HTML via web_parser -> parse_testcases_from_html -> create CFProblem instance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data model with a method to fetch and parse test cases from a URL, relying on external functions injected as callables. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The external dependencies are standard and do not introduce inherent risks. The code does not perform any network activity or data leaks itself, and the logic is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risks. It functions as a simple parser wrapper, depending on external functions that are assumed to be secure. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
