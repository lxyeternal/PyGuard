{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface, importing and executing the 'main' function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'cmd_main' from 'pyforces.cmd.main' and calls it within the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'cmd_main()', which may execute arbitrary commands or code within its implementation.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'cmd_main' and executes it when the script is run directly, with exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a simple launcher that invokes 'cmd_main' from an external module. Since 'cmd_main' is imported from a potentially external package ('pyforces'), the security of this code depends heavily on that module's implementation. The try-except block only catches KeyboardInterrupt, which is normal. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data leaks, or malicious code embedded here. The code does not perform any operations beyond calling an imported function.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard entry point wrapper for a CLI command. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks itself. Any potential risks are tied to the behavior of 'pyforces.cmd.main'. Without inspecting 'pyforces.cmd.main', no malicious activity can be confirmed, and the code itself is benign.",
