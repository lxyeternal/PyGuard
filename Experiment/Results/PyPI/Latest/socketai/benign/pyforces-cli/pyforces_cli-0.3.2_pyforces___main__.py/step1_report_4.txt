{
  "purpose": "This script serves as an entry point that calls the main function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, likely to execute command-line interface functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from 'pyforces.cmd.main', which may involve reading command-line arguments or other input within that module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks in this snippet; potential sinks would be within 'cmd_main()' if it handles untrusted data, but that is outside the scope of this code.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the script calls 'cmd_main()' within a try-except block catching KeyboardInterrupt; no data flows are explicitly visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, wrapping an imported main function with minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a submodule and executes it inside a try-except block that suppresses KeyboardInterrupt exceptions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data leaks. The structure is standard for command-line entry scripts. As the core logic resides in 'cmd_main()', which is not shown, the security implications depend on that module. However, within this code, no malicious or malicious-sounding behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign wrapper for executing a command-line main function from an imported module. No signs of malware or security risks are present in this code snippet. The security risk is minimal, assuming 'cmd_main()' is safe.",
