  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code confirmation:**\n- The code is a minimal wrapper that imports `main` from `pyforces.cmd.main` and executes it within a try-except block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt`.\n- No external inputs are read directly; the only sink is the call to `cmd_main()`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code's security profile hinges on the behavior of `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is external.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n- No logical flaws are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- The exception handling for `KeyboardInterrupt` is standard and benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**3. Scores given in reports:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0.1 or 0.2`.\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- The `malware` score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious code in the snippet.\n- The `securityRisk` is minimal, reflecting reliance on external code.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The scores are all well below 0.5, indicating low risk.\n- No justification is needed for higher scores given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only delegates to an external module, malware potential depends on that module.\n- The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**6. Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly state that security depends on `pyforces.cmd.main`.\n- Any potential vulnerabilities are outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code behavior:**  \nBenign wrapper script, minimal, standard, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Risk scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Security risk: 0.1–0.2 (minimal, depends on external module)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe in isolation. The primary concern is the external module `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is outside this snippet's scope.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Keep the scores as they are; they are reasonable.\n- Emphasize that the security profile depends on the external module's trustworthiness.\n- No changes needed unless additional context about `pyforces.cmd.main` suggests otherwise.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point wrapper.  \n- Scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.",
