{
  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper script that imports and executes 'cmd_main' from 'pyforces.cmd.main', handling KeyboardInterrupt gracefully.",
  "sources": "The call to 'cmd_main()' within the 'main()' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cmd_main()' which may invoke external code; no direct sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'cmd_main()' when run, passing control to the external module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and execution with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI entry point that imports 'main' from an external module and executes it within a try-except block. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on the behavior of 'pyforces.cmd.main'. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the minimal and straightforward nature of the code, and no modifications are necessary. The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of the external module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI wrapper with no malicious or suspicious features. The security profile is very low, and the scores assigned are appropriate. The overall risk depends on the external 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, but the code itself is safe.",
