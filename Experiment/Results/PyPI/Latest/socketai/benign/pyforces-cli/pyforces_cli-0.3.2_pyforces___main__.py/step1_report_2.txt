{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports and executes the main function from the pyforces.cmd.main module, handling KeyboardInterrupt exceptions gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pyforces.cmd.main', call to 'cmd_main()' within main()",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cmd_main()' could potentially execute untrusted code if the module is malicious, but this depends on the external module's implementation",
  "flows": "Import module -> call 'cmd_main()' -> handle KeyboardInterrupt",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; straightforward import and execution pattern, exception handling is standard",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a main function from a specific module and executes it within a try-except block that ignores KeyboardInterrupt. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The security risk and malware potential depend entirely on the contents of 'pyforces.cmd.main', which is external to this code fragment. The code itself is minimal, standard, and does not perform any malicious actions directly.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic script that delegates execution to an external module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The overall security posture depends on the contents of the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, which is outside the scope of this review.",
