{
  "purpose": "The script acts as a simple wrapper to invoke the main function from the 'pyforces.cmd.main' module, providing a try-except block to handle keyboard interrupts gracefully.",
  "sources": "The code imports and calls 'cmd_main' from an external module; no external input sources are directly read within this script.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the call to 'cmd_main', which may execute code from the imported module; no direct data leaks or system modifications are visible.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the script's main() function to 'cmd_main()' in the imported module. No untrusted data flows are evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation. The try-except block for KeyboardInterrupt is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a main function from a package, wraps it in a try-except to ignore KeyboardInterrupts, and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The security risk primarily depends on the behavior of 'pyforces.cmd.main', which is external to this code snippet. The structure and content are typical for a command-line entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign entry point wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks apparent within this snippet. The security profile hinges on the behavior of the imported 'cmd_main' function, which is outside the scope of this review.",
