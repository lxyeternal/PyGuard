  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal wrapper that imports and executes `cmd_main()` from an external module.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The primary concern is the behavior of the external module `pyforces.cmd.main`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The code's malware and obfuscated scores are consistently zero across reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code itself.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code and dependency on external behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Code correctness:**  \n- The code is straightforward, and all reports correctly identify it as a simple wrapper.  \n- No issues are present in the code logic or structure.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated scores:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified unless the external module is malicious.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n**Security Risk scores:**  \n- The scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.  \n- The only potential concern is the external module's trustworthiness, but the code itself doesn't introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or points of critique:\n\n- **Dependence on external module:** All reports correctly state that the security implications depend on `pyforces.cmd.main`. Without inspecting that module, we cannot definitively assess risk.  \n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?** No, all are appropriately low.  \n- **Malware scores higher than 0?** No, consistent with the benign code.  \n- **Claims based on assumptions?** All reports appropriately acknowledge that risks depend on external code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.  \n- No modifications needed based on the code snippet itself.  \n- For a comprehensive security assessment, review the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected here)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (minimal, dependent on external module)\n\n**If I were to assign scores independently:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on external code, but no inherent risk in this snippet)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the risk is minimal, contingent on the external module's trustworthiness. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe and straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
