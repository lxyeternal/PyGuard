  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `main` from `pyforces.cmd.main` as `cmd_main`.\n- Defines a `main()` function that calls `cmd_main()` inside a try-except block to catch `KeyboardInterrupt`.\n- Executes `main()` if the script is run directly.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a minimal wrapper acting as an entry point.\n- No suspicious or malicious code is visible.\n- The core behavior depends on the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, conclusion all indicate benign behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent; the code is benign, and the low risk score aligns with that. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and analysis, emphasizing that security depends on `pyforces.cmd.main`.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same overall conclusion, noting that the potential risk hinges on the external module.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis, emphasizing that no malicious activity is evident in this snippet.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Focuses on the trustworthiness of `pyforces`, noting that malicious behavior could be introduced if the package is compromised.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is reasonable, given the external dependency. The code itself remains benign, but the potential risk depends on the external package.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. Given the code is a simple wrapper, this is correct unless the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module is malicious. Since we cannot verify that here, the malware score remains at 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign `0.1` or `0.2`, reflecting minimal risk. This is appropriate because the code itself is benign, but the overall security depends on the external module.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary unless new information about `pyforces.cmd.main` surfaces.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if there's suspicion about the external package, but based on the current info, they are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — The code itself shows no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — Minimal, assuming the external module is trustworthy. If there's suspicion about `pyforces`, a slight increase to 0.2 could be justified, but current evidence suggests 0.1-0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, minimal CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated features. The security risk is low and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the external `pyforces.cmd.main` module.",
