  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a minimal wrapper that imports and executes `cmd_main()` from an external module (`pyforces.cmd.main`). The code itself does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It simply handles `KeyboardInterrupt` gracefully.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the security implications depend on the external module `pyforces.cmd.main`. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors apparent in the summaries.\n\n**3. Score Justifications and Reasonableness:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet. This is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk inherent in the wrapper code itself. Since the actual behavior depends on an external module, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**4. Risk Scores Higher than 0.5:**  \nNo report assigns a risk score above 0.2. This aligns with the code's benign nature. Given that the code is a straightforward wrapper, higher scores would be unjustified unless external factors are considered.\n\n**5. Malware and External Behavior:**  \nThe core concern is the behavior of `pyforces.cmd.main`. Since the code merely calls this function, any malicious activity would originate from that module. The current code does not introduce or facilitate malicious behavior itself.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the external module, correctly stating that security depends on `pyforces.cmd.main`.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity detected, and the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity within this code snippet.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal risk; depends on external module behavior.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- To fully assess security, review the implementation of `pyforces.cmd.main`.  \n- If `pyforces` is a known, trusted package, the overall risk remains low.  \n- If the package is untrusted or unknown, further scrutiny of its contents is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard CLI entry point wrapper. The security profile is very low, and scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary based on the provided reports.",
