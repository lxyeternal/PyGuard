  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module performing specific tasks, potentially related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, or configuration files; no explicit external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, though none are explicitly shown or invoked with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to output or processing functions is not evident or involves only internal data handling without external untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports are present.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns. It lacks any network activity, system modifications, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
