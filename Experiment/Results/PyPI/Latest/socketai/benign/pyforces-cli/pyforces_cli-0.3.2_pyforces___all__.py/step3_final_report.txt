  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; absence of data sources, input, or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows detected due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is missing or empty, indicating placeholder or incomplete upload.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The high confidence in benign assessment for report 2 aligns with the detailed analysis. The moderate confidence in report 5 appropriately reflects uncertainty due to missing content. Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with no malicious indicators. Obfuscation scores are zero, matching the lack of obfuscation evidence. Security risk scores are low, indicating minimal threat. The scores are coherent with the descriptions and observations, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports accurately reflect the absence of malicious code or suspicious activity. The scoring is consistent and appropriate given the available information. No further action or adjustments are required.",
