  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain task involving data processing or interaction with external resources, though the specific function cannot be determined without code context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files, depending on the implementation details. Without actual code, precise sources cannot be pinpointed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls where untrusted data could be exploited. Specifics depend on code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, possibly through transformations or checks. Without explicit code, this cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without actual code. Common concerns would include hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of code. Generally, one would check for hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, unusual control flow, or dynamic execution. As no code is provided, no specific issues can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks can be confirmed or denied. The overall risk is indeterminate.",
