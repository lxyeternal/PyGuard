{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'pyforces-cli' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The call to 'version('pyforces-cli')' retrieves metadata about the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns the package version to '__version__'; no data flow from untrusted sources exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets beyond the package name.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' to obtain the installed version of the package 'pyforces-cli'. It then assigns this value to the '__version__' variable. There are no user inputs, no data processing, and no untrusted data sources. The code appears to be standard for package version retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for retrieving and storing the package version, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
