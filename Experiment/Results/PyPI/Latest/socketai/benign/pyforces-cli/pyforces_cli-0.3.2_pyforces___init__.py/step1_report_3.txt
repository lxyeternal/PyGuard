  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the installed 'pyforces-cli' package.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' module, called with 'pyforces-cli'.",
  "sinks": "The returned version value, which is a string containing package version info.",
  "flows": "The 'version' function reads package metadata; the version string is assigned to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practice for version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' and assigns the result of 'version('pyforces-cli')' to '__version__'. This is a straightforward package metadata access pattern with no signs of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and does not perform any I/O beyond metadata retrieval. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves and stores the package version information. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe code snippet.",
