  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Issue presence in code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code simply calls `version('pyforces-cli')` and assigns it to `__version__`. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code only retrieves package metadata without any external communication, user input, or processing, the security risk score of 0 is justified. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as standard package metadata retrieval.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate for the benign, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, safe snippet used to retrieve package version info. No issues or risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code and reports accurately reflect the benign nature of this snippet.",
