  "sources": "The call to 'version('pyforces-cli')' which reads package metadata from the environment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; simply fetches package version information.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'version' with a package name, assigns the result to '__version__', and does not process untrusted input further.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata', then assigns the package version to '__version__'. It uses a standard method to retrieve package metadata. No user input, environment variable manipulation, or external communication present. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves and stores the version number of the 'pyforces-cli' package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
