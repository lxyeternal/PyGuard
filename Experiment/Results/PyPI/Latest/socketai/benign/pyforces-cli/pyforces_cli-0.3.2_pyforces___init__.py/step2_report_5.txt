  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward import and assignment:\n     ```python\n     from importlib.metadata import version\n     __version__ = version('pyforces-cli')\n     ```\n   - It simply retrieves the installed package version and assigns it to `__version__`.\n   - No user input, external communication, or data processing occurs.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, and data flows.\n   - They uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, communicate externally, or process untrusted input, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code is not malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard library usage.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard pattern for retrieving package version info in Python. It does not pose any security concerns or malicious risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, benign, and standard. No further action needed.",
