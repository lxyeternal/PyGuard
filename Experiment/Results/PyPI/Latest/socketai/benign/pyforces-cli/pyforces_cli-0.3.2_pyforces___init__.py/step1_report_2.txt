  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the installed 'pyforces-cli' package",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function call to get package version",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only reads package metadata",
  "flows": "Input: package metadata; Output: version string assigned to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple metadata retrieval, no suspicious activity or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function and uses it to obtain the version of a specified package, storing it in __version__. This is typical in Python packages to track version info and does not involve any data from untrusted sources or execute untrusted code. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, intended solely for retrieving package version information. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
