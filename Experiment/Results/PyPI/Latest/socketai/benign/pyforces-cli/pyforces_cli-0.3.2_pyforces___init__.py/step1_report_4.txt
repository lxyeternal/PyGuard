  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'pyforces-cli' package.",
  "sources": "The function call to 'version('pyforces-cli')' which reads the package metadata from the environment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code only reads metadata without any data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "The 'version' function retrieves package version info from the environment and assigns it to '__version__'. No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' and assigns the version of the 'pyforces-cli' package to the '__version__' variable. This is a standard practice to embed package version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves and stores the package version, with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
