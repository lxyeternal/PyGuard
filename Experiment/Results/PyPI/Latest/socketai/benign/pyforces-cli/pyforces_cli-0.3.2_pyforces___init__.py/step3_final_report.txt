{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'pyforces-cli' package using Python's importlib.metadata module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'pyforces-cli' in the call to version('pyforces-cli')",
  "sinks": "The code assigns the retrieved version to __version__, which is a local variable; no external sinks or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Source: package name string 'pyforces-cli' -> importlib.metadata.version() -> sink: assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'version' function from importlib.metadata, then retrieves the version of the 'pyforces-cli' package and assigns it to __version__. It does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions, and no security issues are evident. The lack of any suspicious patterns or anomalies indicates benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for retrieving package version information. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
