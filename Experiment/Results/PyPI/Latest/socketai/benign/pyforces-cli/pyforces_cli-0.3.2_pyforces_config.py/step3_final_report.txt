{
  "purpose": "Manage configuration data and code templates via JSON files and file copying operations.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON configuration files, paths provided in code or config, and user-specified source/destination paths for copying files.",
  "sinks": "File copying with shutil.copy() which could overwrite or copy files based on unvalidated paths.",
  "flows": "Configuration data read from JSON -> paths used in shutil.copy() -> files copied to specified destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or embedded secrets; standard file operations without validation of paths.",
  "analysis": "The code handles configuration management and template copying using standard libraries. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The main concern is the lack of path validation before copying files, which could be exploited if paths are maliciously controlled, but this is a common pattern in such utilities. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are present. Scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration and template management utility with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary risk relates to unvalidated file paths, which is a standard consideration in file I/O operations but does not indicate malicious activity.",
