{
  "purpose": "The code selects and generates a template file based on user input or default configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'cfg' object (cfg.templates, cfg.default_template) and the optional 'name' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'template.generate(f)', which writes a generated file 'f' in the current working directory.",
  "flows": "User input 'name' influences selection of 'template'; the filename 'f' is derived from current directory name plus template suffix; 'template.generate(f)' writes output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'Path.cwd().parts[-1]' to derive filename, which is generally safe; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or network activity observed; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from a provided 'cfg' object, with optional user input to select a template. It constructs a filename based on the current directory name and template suffix, then calls a generate method. The process appears standard for template generation workflows. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity is present. The code's logic is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no evident security risks or malicious intent. The use of 'logger' for error reporting is normal practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple template selection and generation process without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for template handling with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
