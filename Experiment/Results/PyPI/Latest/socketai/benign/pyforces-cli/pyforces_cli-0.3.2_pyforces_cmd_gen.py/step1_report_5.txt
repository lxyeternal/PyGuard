  "purpose": "Generate a filename based on the current directory and a selected template, then invoke a generate method on the template.",
  "sources": "cfg.templates, cfg.default_template, Path.cwd().parts",
  "sinks": "template.generate(f)",
  "flows": "template.generate(f) is called with filename derived from current directory and template suffix",
  "anomalies": "Concatenation of Path parts with string + suffix may lead to incorrect filename; no explicit security checks on input variables",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a template based on user input or default configuration, then constructs a filename from the current directory's name plus the template's suffix. The filename is passed to the generate method of the template object. The process is straightforward, with no visible external network communication, data storage, or execution of untrusted input beyond string concatenation. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is the construction of filename using current directory name and template suffix, which does not appear malicious but could lead to incorrect filenames if directory or template names are manipulated. Overall, the code appears benign with respect to malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple template selection and filename generation process with no evident malicious behavior. It reads configuration data and the current directory name, then calls a generate method. No network or data exfiltration occurs, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
