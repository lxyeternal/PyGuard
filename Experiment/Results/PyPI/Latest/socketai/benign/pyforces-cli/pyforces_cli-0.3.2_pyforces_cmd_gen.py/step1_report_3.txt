  "purpose": "Generate a filename based on the current directory name and a template, then generate a template file.",
  "sources": "cfg.templates (reads templates list), cfg.default_template (reads default template index), Path.cwd() (reads current working directory).",
  "sinks": "template.generate(f) (writes to a file named after current directory with template suffix).",
  "flows": "Reading configuration data -> constructing filename from current directory -> calling generate method with filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file paths, no obfuscated code, no external network access, no malicious API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data and current directory information to determine a filename. It then invokes a generate method on a template object, passing the filename. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or executing untrusted code. The code mainly handles file path manipulation and logging, which are typical for template generation workflows. The use of Path.cwd() and template.generate() appears legitimate within the context of a code generator or templating system.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file and configuration handling to generate a filename based on the current directory and selected template. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
