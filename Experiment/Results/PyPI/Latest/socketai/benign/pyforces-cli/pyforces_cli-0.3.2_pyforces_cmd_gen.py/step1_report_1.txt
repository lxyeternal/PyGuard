  "flows": "Template selection from cfg.templates or default, constructing filename f, then calling template.generate(f)",
  "anomalies": "Use of Path.cwd().parts[-1] to dynamically generate filename; no apparent malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses configuration data to select a template. It constructs a filename based on the current directory name and the template's suffix, then calls generate() on the template object. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources like user input or network, aside from configuration, which appears controlled. The filename construction is simple and based on current directory, which doesn't pose a security risk. The generate method's implementation isn't provided, but based on context, it likely generates files based on the filename, which appears safe. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code doesn't handle untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs controlled configuration-based template selection and filename generation without any malicious behavior or security risks. The operations are straightforward, and no suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
