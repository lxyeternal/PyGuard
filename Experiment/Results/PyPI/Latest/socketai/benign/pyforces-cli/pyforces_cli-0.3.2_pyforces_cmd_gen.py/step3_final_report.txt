{
  "purpose": "Selects a template based on configuration or user input, constructs a filename from the current directory name and template suffix, then calls generate() on the template.",
  "sources": "Current working directory name (`Path.cwd().parts[-1]`), template's suffix (`template.path.suffix`), optional `name` parameter for template selection.",
  "sinks": "The filename `f` used in `template.generate(f)`; potential for filename issues if directory names are manipulated, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Current directory name + template suffix → filename `f` → `template.generate(f)`",
  "anomalies": "Use of `Path.cwd().parts[-1]` for filename construction; no external untrusted input affecting filename; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs template selection based on configuration or input, constructs a filename from trusted internal data, and calls a generate method. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The filename construction method is straightforward but could be manipulated if directory names are malicious, though this is unlikely to be malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with low malware and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of external input or obfuscation support a conclusion of minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward template selection and filename generation routine with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores assigned are appropriate, and the code appears safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
