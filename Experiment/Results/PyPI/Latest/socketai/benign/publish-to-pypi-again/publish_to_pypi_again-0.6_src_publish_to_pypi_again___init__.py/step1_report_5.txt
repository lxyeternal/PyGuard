  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and then to sinks, such as network or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the actual code. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or unusual imports.",
