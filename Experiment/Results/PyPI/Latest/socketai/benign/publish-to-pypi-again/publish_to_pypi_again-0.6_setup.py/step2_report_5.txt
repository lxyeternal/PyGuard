  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0.1 or 0).\n\n**Confirmations and discrepancies:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows.\n- Dependencies are common scientific libraries, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated: All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- SecurityRisk: Mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in some reports. Since the script is purely static and standard, this might be slightly overestimating the risk, but it's not unreasonable considering that package dependencies could be malicious if compromised. However, no evidence of such here.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 might be slightly high for a static setup script but acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The setup script is safe, with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- The scores are justified and consistent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk exists.",
