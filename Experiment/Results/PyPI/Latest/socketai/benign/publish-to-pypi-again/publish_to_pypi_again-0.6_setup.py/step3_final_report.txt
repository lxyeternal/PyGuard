  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and package directory information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns. Dependencies are common scientific libraries ('scikit-learn', 'numpy') with no signs of malicious intent. The code structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscation or malicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script. All reports align with this assessment, confirming the code's safety.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious or suspicious features. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
