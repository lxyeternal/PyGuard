  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'publish_to_pypi_again' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies ('scikit-learn', 'numpy'), and package directory info.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed, but no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No external data flow beyond standard setup process; dependencies are predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No suspicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. No malicious or malicious-sounding commands, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dependencies are common packages without any indications of malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
