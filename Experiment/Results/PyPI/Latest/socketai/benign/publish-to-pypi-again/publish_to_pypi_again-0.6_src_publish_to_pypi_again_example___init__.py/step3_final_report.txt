  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sockets, external files, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, system commands, subprocess execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file outputs, possibly via dynamic code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network addresses, incomplete code, dynamic imports, potential backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with no suspicious indicators. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising suspicion. The other reports lack evidence of malicious activity. The scores assigned are generally consistent with the described behaviors. Report 2's malware score could be slightly increased to reflect the suspicious patterns more strongly, but remains moderate. The overall confidence in benign assessments is high for most reports, with moderate confidence in Report 2 due to the suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; Report 2 shows moderate suspicion due to eval/exec and obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment recommended for Report 2's malware score to better reflect the potential risk.",
