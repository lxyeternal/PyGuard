  "flows": "Import numpy -> call get_numpy_version -> return numpy.__version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a well-known library to get version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the numpy library and defines a function that returns its version number. There is no user input, no data leaks, no network activity, or any suspicious code. The code is simple and standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a harmless operation to retrieve the numpy version. There is no malware or security concern present.",
