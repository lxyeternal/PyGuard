  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the numpy library installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "Import statement for numpy; access to numpy.__version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the version string; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import numpy -> Access numpy.__version__ -> Return version string.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function that returns its version. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, simple utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, data leaks, or external data flows. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs a harmless operation with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for retrieving numpy's version. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
