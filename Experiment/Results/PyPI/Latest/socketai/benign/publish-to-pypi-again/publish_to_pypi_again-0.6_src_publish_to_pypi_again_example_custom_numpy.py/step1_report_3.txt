  "purpose": "The code retrieves and returns the version of the numpy library.",
  "sources": "The numpy library, specifically the attribute '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement accessing numpy.__version__.",
  "flows": "Import numpy -> get_numpy_version() -> return numpy.__version__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the numpy library and defines a simple function to return its version. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data, no data sinks that leak information, and no flow involving external data. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features without any unusual constructs or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility function for version checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, performing a simple retrieval of the numpy package version. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
