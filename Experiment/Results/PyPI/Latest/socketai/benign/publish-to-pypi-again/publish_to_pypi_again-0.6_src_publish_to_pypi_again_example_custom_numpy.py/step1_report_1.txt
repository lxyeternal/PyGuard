  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version of the numpy library.",
  "sources": "Reading the attribute 'numpy.__version__' to get the version information.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leak or malicious effect; simply returns version string.",
  "flows": "Source: numpy.__version__; Sink: return statement providing version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function to return its version. There are no inputs from external sources, no data being processed or transmitted, and no malicious or suspicious constructs present. Usage of a standard library attribute is safe and typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, serving only to retrieve numpy's version. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are identified.",
