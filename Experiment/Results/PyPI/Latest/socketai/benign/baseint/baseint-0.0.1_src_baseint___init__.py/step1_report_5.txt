{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling integers in arbitrary bases, allowing conversions and string representations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'values' parameter (int, str, list, tuple) and optional parameters like 'base', 'forceUpper', and 'charmap'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks or network communication points; it primarily processes data locally within the class.",
  "flows": "Input 'values' are processed and stored internally; methods convert between representations and bases, but there are no external data flows or untrusted data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard base conversion and string manipulation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes by validating input types and values, converts input to internal representation, and provides methods for string output and base conversion. All operations are straightforward mathematical transformations and string manipulations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation techniques are used. The code appears purely functional and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The design is typical for such a utility class, with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for base conversions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations without any suspicious behavior or malicious features.",
