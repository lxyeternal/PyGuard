{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for handling integers in arbitrary bases, allowing conversions and string representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'values', 'base', 'forceUpper', 'charmap' in __init__; data read from these parameters during initialization and conversion methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that could process or output data include __repr__, __str__, toDecimal, dec2base, sconvert, convert. No untrusted external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, with conversions and string representations based on these values. No external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The class performs standard base conversions, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BaseInt class for representing and converting integers between arbitrary bases. It accepts various input types, validates data, and provides methods for conversion and representation. No external data sinks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. All data handling appears safe, with proper validation and no embedded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of base conversions and string representations for integers. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
