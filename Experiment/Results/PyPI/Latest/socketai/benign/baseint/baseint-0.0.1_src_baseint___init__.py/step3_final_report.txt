  "purpose": "A class for handling integers in arbitrary bases, providing conversion, string representation, and validation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input values provided during class instantiation, specifically 'values' parameter; character map used in string conversion.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network activity, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Input 'values' are processed via index lookups in 'charmap' during string parsing; conversions between decimal and arbitrary bases; validation checks on input values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'self.charmap.index()' could raise exceptions if input contains characters not in 'charmap'; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard base conversion operations with input validation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of 'index()' is a normal validation step that could raise exceptions with malicious input, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and safe. The minor potential for exceptions does not indicate security issues or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a base conversion utility with proper validation. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by potential input validation exceptions but does not imply malicious intent.",
