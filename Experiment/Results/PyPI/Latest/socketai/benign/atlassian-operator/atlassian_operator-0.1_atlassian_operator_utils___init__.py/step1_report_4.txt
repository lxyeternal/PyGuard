  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, or data writes; specific details are not provided in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through various functions towards sinks like network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical malware indicators such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no malicious network activity or system commands are apparent within the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
