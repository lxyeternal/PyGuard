  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package related to Atlassian product deployment with Docker.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (BITBUCKET_TAG), reading and writing 'version_dev.txt', reading 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, file I/O, package setup configuration, and defining console scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable BITBUCKET_TAG or file 'version_dev.txt' -> setting VERSION; File reads for README.md and version_dev.txt -> setup configuration; Console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: dynamically determining package version, reading README content, and configuring package metadata. It reads environment variables and files securely, uses standard setup tools, and defines a console script. There are no suspicious network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
