  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, handling versioning, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BITBUCKET_TAG), version_dev.txt file, README.md file, package data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and files to determine version, then proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads version info from environment variables or a file, updates the version file if needed, reads README for long description, and configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The version handling via environment variables is common in CI/CD pipelines and does not pose security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate a safe setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
