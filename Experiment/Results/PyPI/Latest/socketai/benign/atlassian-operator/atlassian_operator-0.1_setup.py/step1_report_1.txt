{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'atlassian-operator' package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (BITBUCKET_TAG), reads and writes 'version_dev.txt', reads 'README.md', and imports setup-related modules.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'version_dev.txt' file, potentially reading environment variables, and executing the setup() function.",
  "flows": "Environment variable BITBUCKET_TAG or file read/write influences VERSION; setup() uses this version; reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic version generation based on environment variable or file read/write; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines the package version from an environment variable or a file, then configures package metadata and dependencies for setup. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code adheres to standard setup script practices without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with dynamic version handling. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It follows typical patterns for package configuration.",
