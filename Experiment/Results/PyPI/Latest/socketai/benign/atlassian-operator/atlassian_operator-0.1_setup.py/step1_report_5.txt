  "purpose": "Set up and configure a Python package for deploying Atlassian products with Docker.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BITBUCKET_TAG), file reads (version_dev.txt, README.md), and package data files.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data output or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or file read influences 'VERSION' value, which is then used in package setup; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated patterns. Version management via environment variable and file read is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading environment variables, files, and preparing package metadata. Versioning logic is straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
