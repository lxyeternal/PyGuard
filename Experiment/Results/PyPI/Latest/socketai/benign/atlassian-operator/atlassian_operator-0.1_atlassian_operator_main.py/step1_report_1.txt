  "purpose": "This script serves as the main entry point for the Atlassian Operator CLI, parsing command-line arguments and invoking corresponding API methods.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), imports functions and classes from atlassian_operator modules, and reads attributes from the args object.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods of the AppApi class dynamically via getattr, and may invoke methods based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs are parsed from sys.argv, processed to determine the command, which then dynamically calls corresponding methods in AppApi.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual logic observed. The code dynamically invokes methods based on user input but includes proper attribute checks.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an argument parser and handles user commands, providing help messages and error handling. It logs output via AppLogger and executes API commands based on parsed arguments. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions. The dynamic method invocation using getattr is standard and guarded against attribute errors. No external data exfiltration, reverse shells, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior. It securely processes user input to invoke class methods without executing untrusted code or exposing sensitive data. The overall security risk is minimal.",
