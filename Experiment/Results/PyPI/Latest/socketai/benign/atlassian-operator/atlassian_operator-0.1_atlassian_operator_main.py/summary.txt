  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, secure CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to the dynamic method invocation, which is properly guarded. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use, assuming external modules are secure."
