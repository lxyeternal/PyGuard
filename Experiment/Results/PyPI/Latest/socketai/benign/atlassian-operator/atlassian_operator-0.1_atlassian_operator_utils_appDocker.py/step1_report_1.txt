  "purpose": "Manage Docker containers and images for a specific application, providing commands to list, start, stop, pull, and upgrade containers.",
  "sources": "docker.from_env() initialization, docker container and image retrieval methods, environment variables, user-provided arguments for container management.",
  "sinks": "Docker container run and remove operations, image pull, container stop/remove, logging functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment or arguments -> Docker API calls for container/image management -> Logging and output.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard Docker SDK functions with no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual data handling. Logging of image digests and container info is standard for management tools. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Docker containers using the Docker SDK for Python. It initializes a Docker client, manages network creation, and provides methods for listing containers, starting, stopping, pulling images, and upgrading containers. The code includes error handling for Docker exceptions, uses environment variables and user inputs for container management, and logs significant actions. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No network communications beyond Docker API calls are observed. The code does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or remote command execution outside Docker operations. The functions are standard container management operations with appropriate error handling. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Docker container management script with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It uses common SDK functions for container operations and includes proper error handling. No signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious data handling are present.",
