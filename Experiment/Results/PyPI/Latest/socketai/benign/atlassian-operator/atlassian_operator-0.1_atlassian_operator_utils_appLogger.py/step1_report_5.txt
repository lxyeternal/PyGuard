{
  "purpose": "A simple logging utility that outputs formatted log messages with different severity levels and a logo display.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'log_content' for logging functions, and 'time_string' in print_relative_time method.",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs; no direct untrusted data sinks that lead to external systems or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input 'log_content' flows into print statements for various log types; 'time_string' flows into datetime parsing and calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code mainly performs formatted printing and date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class 'AppLogger' with static methods for various log levels, a logo display, and a relative time formatter. No user input is directly fetched or processed; the 'log_content' and 'time_string' are parameters provided during invocation. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration is present. The functions perform formatting and printing, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic logging utility without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It strictly outputs formatted logs and performs date calculations, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
