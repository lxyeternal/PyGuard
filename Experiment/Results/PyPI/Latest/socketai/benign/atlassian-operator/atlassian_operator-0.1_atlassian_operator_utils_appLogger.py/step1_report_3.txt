  "purpose": "This code defines a logging utility class for printing formatted log messages with various severity levels and a logo display, primarily for console output.",
  "sources": "Input source is the main program execution, with no external data or input reading; no external or untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data outputs that handle untrusted input or sensitive data. The code only prints static or provided log messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks. The class methods simply print provided strings; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code, are present. The code mainly contains static print statements and a logo generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with static methods for printing formatted messages to the console. No user input, network communication, or external data processing occurs. The methods are designed for status, warning, failure, and success messages, with no data transformations or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands, is evident. The code appears clean, with no obfuscated elements or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign logging utility that outputs messages to the console. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and purely for informational and debugging purposes.",
