{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple logging utility with various static methods for printing formatted log messages, including info, warning, failure, success, and logo display functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted inputs are read by the code. It primarily outputs static formatted messages.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs messages to the console via print statements. There are no sinks that send untrusted data over the network or write to files.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static method calls (e.g., launch, failure, warning) that print formatted strings to stdout, with no data transformations or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only notable feature is the use of Unicode characters for formatting, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static methods that generate formatted log messages with Unicode symbols for visual clarity. The only dynamic behavior involves printing to standard output and a method for printing relative time based on a timestamp. There are no input sources, external data reads, or data processing that could introduce security risks. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected. The code appears to serve as a straightforward logging utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility designed for formatting and printing messages with visual icons. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
