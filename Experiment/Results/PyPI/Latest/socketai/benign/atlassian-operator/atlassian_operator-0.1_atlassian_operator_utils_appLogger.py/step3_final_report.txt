  "purpose": "A simple logging utility providing styled console output and date-related functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to static methods (log_content, tab_string, time_string). No external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "Console print statements; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into print statements; date parsing in print_relative_time processes time_string to compute relative time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow. Unicode characters are benign stylistic choices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static class with methods for printing styled logs and a date difference calculator. No external data handling, network calls, or obfuscation. The only dynamic feature is date parsing in print_relative_time, which is standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The high security risk scores in the initial reports are unjustified; the code's benign nature warrants a score close to zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility with no malicious or security risks. The initial high security risk scores are overestimated; the code should be rated with malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1.",
