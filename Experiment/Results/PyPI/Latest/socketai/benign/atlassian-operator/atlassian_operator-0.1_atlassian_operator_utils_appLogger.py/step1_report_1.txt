{
  "purpose": "A simple logging utility providing various styled output methods for different log levels, including launch, failure, warning, success, and logo display.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; all inputs are method parameters with no direct user input or environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "Console print statements are used for output; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly formatted and printed; no data flows from external sources to sinks without validation or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, primarily involving print statements and date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AppLogger' with static methods for various logging functions, utilizing Unicode characters for visual appeal. There are no external data sources or network calls, and no suspicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system modification. The 'logo' method prints an ASCII art banner, and 'print_relative_time' computes time differences based on input. The code appears to be purely for logging and presentation purposes, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging utility with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It only outputs styled messages to the console and performs date calculations without external dependencies or data leaks.",
