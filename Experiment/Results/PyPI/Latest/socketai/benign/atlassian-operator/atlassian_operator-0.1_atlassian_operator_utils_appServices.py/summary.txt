  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader for Docker containers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risks inherent in its logic. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk score (0.2) are justified. External YAML files could pose risks if compromised, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
