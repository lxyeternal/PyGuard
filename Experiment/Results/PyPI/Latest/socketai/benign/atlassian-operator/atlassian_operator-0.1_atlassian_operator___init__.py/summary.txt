  "conclusion": "The code exhibits features typical of potentially malicious scripts, primarily due to dynamic code execution and network activity. While no explicit payloads are identified, these features justify a moderate security concern. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this risk, with malware at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.4, and security risk at 0.5."
