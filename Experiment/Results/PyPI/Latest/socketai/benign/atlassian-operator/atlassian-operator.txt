      "conclusion": "The code exhibits features typical of potentially malicious scripts, primarily due to dynamic code execution and network activity. While no explicit payloads are identified, these features justify a moderate security concern. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this risk, with malware at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.4, and security risk at 0.5."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, secure CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to the dynamic method invocation, which is properly guarded. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use, assuming external modules are secure."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader for Docker containers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risks inherent in its logic. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk score (0.2) are justified. External YAML files could pose risks if compromised, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

The overall threat level appears minimal, with cautious attention warranted primarily for obfuscated code that may conceal malicious intent."
