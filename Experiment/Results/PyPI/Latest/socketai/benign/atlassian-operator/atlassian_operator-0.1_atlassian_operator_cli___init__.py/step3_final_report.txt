    "reasoning": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or suspicious activity, assigning appropriate zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects the limited context and potential for hidden issues, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. Slightly reduced purpose and confidence scores in some reports are warranted due to missing code, but overall, the assessments are consistent and cautious. No significant adjustments are necessary."
