  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some operation involving data processing or network communication, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Data sources likely include input functions, environment variables, or network connections; however, no specific source code is available to identify exact locations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network transmission functions, file writes, or system commands; exact details are unavailable due to missing code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be mapped without the actual code, making it impossible to identify source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns can be identified without the code content. The absence of code precludes detection of hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "No code was provided for analysis. Without specific code snippets, it's impossible to evaluate for malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The review cannot proceed without code content.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to assess code for malicious behavior or security risks. Please provide the actual code for a detailed review.",
