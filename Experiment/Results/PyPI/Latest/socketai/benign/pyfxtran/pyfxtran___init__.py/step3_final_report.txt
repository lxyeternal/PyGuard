{
  "purpose": "A wrapper script that clones, builds, and executes the fxtran tool on a specified FORTRAN file, automating setup and execution.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory for cache, clones the fxtran repository via 'git clone', reads and modifies the makefile, and runs external commands ('git', 'make', fxtran binary).",
  "sinks": "Executes external commands ('git', 'make', the fxtran binary) which process files and produce output; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Cloning repository -> modifying makefile -> compiling with 'make' -> running fxtran on input file -> outputting transformed code.",
  "anomalies": "Modifies the makefile to append build instructions; runs 'make' with 'check=False', which may hide build failures; suppresses subprocess output during build steps.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build automation: cloning a specific repository version, adjusting build instructions, compiling, and executing the tool. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. External commands are used in a controlled manner, with error handling for build failures. The suppression of build output could hide errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The reliance on external repositories and commands is typical for such scripts but could be exploited if the repository or environment is compromised. Overall, the script is a legitimate automation wrapper with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward build-and-run wrapper for fxtran with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is reliance on external sources and commands, which is standard for such automation but warrants trust in the environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2–0.3).",
