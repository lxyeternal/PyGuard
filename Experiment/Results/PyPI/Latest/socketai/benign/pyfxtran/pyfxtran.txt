      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward build-and-run wrapper for fxtran with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is reliance on external sources and commands, which is standard for such automation but warrants trust in the environment. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2–0.3)."
