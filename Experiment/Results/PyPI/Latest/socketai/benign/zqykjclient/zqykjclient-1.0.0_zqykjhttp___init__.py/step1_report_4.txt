  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a demonstration or utility script related to Python dependency analysis or security review, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from standard input, possibly files or network sources if present; however, no explicit data sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system commands are present; code does not appear to perform unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident in the code; the code primarily performs static analysis or formatting tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a code review utility.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a static analysis or code formatting utility, with no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns are identified. Given the absence of data sources, sinks, or anomalous behavior, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems benign and focused on code review or formatting tasks. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
