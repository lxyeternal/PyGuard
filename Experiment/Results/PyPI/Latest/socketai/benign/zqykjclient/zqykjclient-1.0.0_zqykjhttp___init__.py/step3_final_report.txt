  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns based on static analysis and code review.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions, environment variables, external modules, data processing routines",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, system commands, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Input sources to data processing or external interactions, possibly leading to malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, unusual code structures, unnecessary dynamic execution, suspicious external calls, obfuscation indicators",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. Input and environment data are used in standard ways, with no evidence of malicious intent. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the absence of malicious indicators and the limited context. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and lower where only descriptions are available. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The overall assessment suggests the code is safe, with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided information. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a benign assessment.",
