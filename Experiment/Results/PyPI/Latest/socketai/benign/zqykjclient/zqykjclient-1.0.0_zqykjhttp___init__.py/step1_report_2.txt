  "flows": "Without the code, it is not possible to definitively identify source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of code content. There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs visible.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted without actual code; therefore, no detailed analysis of code structure, behavior, or potential malicious intent can be performed. It is essential to analyze the actual code to identify any security issues or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, no malicious activity or security risks can be confirmed. The provided input does not contain code to evaluate; thus, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Further review is necessary with the actual code snippet.",
