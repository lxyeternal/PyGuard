{
  "purpose": "A client wrapper for a finance-related REST API, providing methods to retrieve and manage models, rules, tasks, and protocols.",
  "sources": "HTTP request functions (`requests.Session().get()` and `.post()`), URL construction with input parameters, response JSON parsing.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data, exception raising with detailed error info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (rule_id, model_id, task_id, protocol_data) are used to construct URLs; network requests are made; responses are checked and parsed; errors are raised or data returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors; standard error handling; no malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client that constructs URLs dynamically, manages network requests with proper error handling, and returns parsed JSON data. It uses standard practices without obfuscation or malicious logic. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage are present. The response handling is robust, and no secrets or sensitive data are hardcoded. The network interactions are typical for such clients, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to network interactions which are standard for API clients.",
