{
  "purpose": "A client class to interact with a financial model API, including functions for fetching rules, models, tasks, and protocols, as well as handling responses and errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URLs, rule_id, model_id, task_id, and protocol data; response objects from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Response handling functions that parse JSON data; HTTP request methods (GET and POST) that send and receive data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → URL construction → HTTP request → response handling → return data or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of standard requests library; response parsing includes error handling but no suspicious data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for a financial modeling service. It constructs URLs from base_url and IDs, performs GET or POST requests, and handles responses with error checking. No data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The error handling includes parsing JSON error messages, which is standard. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present. The code structure and logic are typical for such API clients.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows. It is safe based on the provided content.",
