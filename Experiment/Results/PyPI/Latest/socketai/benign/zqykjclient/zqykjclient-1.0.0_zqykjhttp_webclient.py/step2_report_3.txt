  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a client wrapper around a REST API, performing GET and POST requests.\n- Response handling involves error checking and JSON parsing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is evident.\n- The code appears well-structured, with standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or supply chain attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Clear, well-structured, no malicious behavior, minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The low security risk score is justified given the code's nature. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward API client, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No security concerns or malware.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, standard API client, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Slightly higher security risk score is acceptable, but still minimal.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, justified given the code's purpose and implementation.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the consistent findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to network operations, but standard for API clients)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to network communication, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable and justified. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are or adjust the security risk slightly higher (e.g., 0.2) if considering the network interactions as potential attack vectors, but overall, the current scores are appropriate.",
