  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a client for a finance API, with methods for retrieving models, rules, tasks, and protocols. It uses standard requests, handles errors properly, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code's straightforward nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing standard API client practices, safe error handling, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No security issues or malware signals are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical API client with proper error handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard API client, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—standard API client, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score but still low, justified by the code's straightforwardness.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious activity or code behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which is appropriate considering the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content**. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond the minimal inherent risks of network communication, which are well-managed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (average of the reports' scores, reflecting minimal inherent network interaction risk)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or suspicious features.",
