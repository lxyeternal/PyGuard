  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code does not perform any command execution, write to files, or handle sensitive data insecurely.\n   - The network requests are straightforward, and response handling is standard.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Structure:**\n   - The code constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters.\n   - Uses `requests.Session()` for efficient HTTP connections.\n   - Handles HTTP errors gracefully, raising custom exceptions with detailed info.\n   - The functions are simple wrappers around API endpoints, with no complex or suspicious logic.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as a typical API client.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and free from malicious intent is sound.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risks (e.g., network requests), but overall very low.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk:**\n   - Since the code is a simple API client, and no malicious activity is detected, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The only potential concern could be if the API endpoints or data were malicious, but the code itself does not exhibit such behavior.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a well-structured, standard API client.\n   - No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n   - The response handling and error management are appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for networked API clients)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
