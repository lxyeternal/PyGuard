  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface to interact with a finance-related API, including methods to retrieve and manage models, rules, tasks, and protocols.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (e.g., rule_id, model_id, task_id, protocol_data) and configuration (base_url). Uses responses from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data handling is minimal; response data is parsed as JSON. No data is written to files, database, or external systems. No command execution or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (function arguments, configuration) -> HTTP requests -> Response handling and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; URL construction is straightforward. Use of requests.Session is standard; no suspicious headers or parameters are used. No evident obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for API interaction with methods for retrieving and managing financial models, rules, tasks, and protocols. Each method constructs URLs based on input parameters and makes GET or POST requests. Response handling involves raising errors for failed requests and parsing JSON results. The custom exception class encapsulates API error details. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network behavior are present. The code appears well-structured and secure in its current form, with no evident malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs routine data fetching and command execution via HTTP requests. There are no indications of sabotage, data exfiltration, or malware. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
