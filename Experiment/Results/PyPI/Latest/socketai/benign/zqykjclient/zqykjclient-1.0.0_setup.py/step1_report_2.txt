{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies ('requests'), package metadata (author, email, description), and the README file.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'open' function reading 'README.md' which could be manipulated if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "The setup() function gathers metadata and dependencies, primarily from static sources and a local file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns detected. Use of 'open' to read README.md is standard but could be risky if the file is tampered, though this is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package. It uses 'setuptools' to specify package name, version, dependencies, author info, and long description. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior present. The use of 'open' to read 'README.md' is standard, though it assumes the file is safe and correctly located. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
