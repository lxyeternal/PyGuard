  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and long description from static sources; reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data sinks leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Static data from package metadata to setup configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script employing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and description. It performs static operations without dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The use of open('README.md') is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to zero. The confidence in these assessments is high (score 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
