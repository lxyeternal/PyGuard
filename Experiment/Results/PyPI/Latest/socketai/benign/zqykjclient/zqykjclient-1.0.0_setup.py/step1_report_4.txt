{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "None, as the code does not read external inputs or untrusted data at runtime; it is a static setup script",
  "sinks": "None, the code does not include any data sinks or output operations, particularly no network or file output with untrusted data",
  "flows": "None, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; standard setup script, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration file using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package info, dependencies, and reads the README.md file for the long description. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious activity observed. No suspicious code structures, backdoors, or secret leaks. It appears to be a standard, benign packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
