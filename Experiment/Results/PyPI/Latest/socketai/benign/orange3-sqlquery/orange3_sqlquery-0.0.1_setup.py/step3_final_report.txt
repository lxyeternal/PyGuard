  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; standard setup invocation.",
  "flows": "Import setuptools -> call setup() in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal Python setup script that imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it within a main guard. It contains no parameters, arguments, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not handle external input, perform network operations, or write files. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no security issues or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
