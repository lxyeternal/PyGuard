  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, standard setup script importing `setup` from setuptools and calling it in the main block.\n- No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The code is typical for Python packaging.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code itself is benign, straightforward, and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the clear, minimal nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, with no contradictions or assumptions that could lead to misclassification.\n\n**Potential issues or adjustments:**\n- Since the code is extremely minimal, there is little room for malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a benign, standard packaging script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script. The scoring and reasoning are justified and consistent.",
