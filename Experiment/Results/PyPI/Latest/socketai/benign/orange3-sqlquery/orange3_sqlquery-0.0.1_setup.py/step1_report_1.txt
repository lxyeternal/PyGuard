  "purpose": "The script is used to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The script reads the module name, version, and other metadata indirectly through setup() if specified elsewhere, but none are provided here.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It imports the setup function and executes it within the main block, with no additional parameters or behavior. There are no indications of malicious activity, no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or backdoors. The script is typical for package distribution and lacks any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
