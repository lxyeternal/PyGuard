      "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and accurately assess the security posture of the code. No confirmed malicious activity is detected. Suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic code execution are present in some reports but lack definitive malicious payloads. Slightly increasing malware suspicion scores for Reports 2 and 4 to better reflect their obfuscation and dynamic behavior is justified. Overall, the codebase appears benign with some caution warranted due to obfuscation and dynamic features."

      "conclusion": "The widget performs standard SQL query execution on input tables with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk stems from executing untrusted SQL, which is inherent to such tools but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the risk score around 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential for misuse but not active malicious behavior."

The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code is safe and requires no modifications."
