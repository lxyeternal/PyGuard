  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a straightforward configuration snippet defining widget metadata and documentation paths.\n   - It uses `sysconfig.get_path('data')` to dynamically determine data directories, then formats these into URLs or file paths.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - The code is static, with only standard library calls and string formatting.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, serving only to set metadata and documentation paths.\n   - They highlight that the use of `sysconfig.get_path('data')` is standard and safe.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or potential vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - The reports correctly identify that no data leaks, untrusted data processing, or malicious activity exists.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting consensus on benign nature.\n   - The only report with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) still concludes safety.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Clarifications:**\n   - Since the code only references documentation paths, there are no reasons to assign any malware or security risk scores above 0.\n   - The use of `sysconfig.get_path('data')` is standard for locating data directories, not suspicious.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is purely configuration metadata with no security concerns. The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
