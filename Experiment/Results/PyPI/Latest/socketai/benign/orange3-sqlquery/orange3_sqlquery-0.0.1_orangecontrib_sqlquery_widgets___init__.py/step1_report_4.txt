  "purpose": "This code defines metadata and help documentation paths for an SQLQuery widget in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the sysconfig.get_path function call, which retrieves configuration data paths.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings and configuration paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code is straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sysconfig to dynamically determine the data path for documentation inclusion. It assigns descriptive metadata for the widget, including name, description, icon, priority, background color, and help documentation links. All paths are either static or retrieved through sysconfig, which is standard for configuration. No user input processing, network activity, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for widget metadata with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply sets static and dynamically obtained paths for documentation and metadata.",
