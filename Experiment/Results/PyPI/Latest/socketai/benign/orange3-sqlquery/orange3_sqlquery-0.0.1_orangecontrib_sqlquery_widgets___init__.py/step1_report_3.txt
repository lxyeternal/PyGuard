  "purpose": "Defines metadata and help documentation paths for the SQLQuery widget used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_path('data') call to determine documentation path",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data usage, no data leaks or insecure operations",
  "flows": "sysconfig.get_path('data') outputs to the help path string; no further data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and placeholder paths suggest a development or configuration setup; no malicious or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets widget metadata, including name, description, icon, priority, background color, and documentation paths. It uses sysconfig.get_path('data') to dynamically determine a documentation directory path. The paths are used for local help and online documentation. No user input, untrusted data, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be standard configuration for a widget in a larger system, with comments indicating development and documentation details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet setting up documentation paths and widget metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be safe and intended for documentation referencing in a widget system.",
