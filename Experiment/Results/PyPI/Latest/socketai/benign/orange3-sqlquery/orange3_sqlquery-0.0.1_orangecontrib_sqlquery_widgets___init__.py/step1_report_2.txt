  "purpose": "Define metadata and help documentation paths for the SQLQuery widget",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_path('data') to determine documentation path",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow leading to potential leaks or execution of untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only constructs constants and paths",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports sysconfig to determine the path for documentation files, constructs a list of help paths for local and online documentation, and defines widget metadata. There are no user inputs, network communications, or execution of untrusted code. It is purely configuration and metadata setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving as metadata for a widget. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
