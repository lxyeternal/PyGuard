  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily static configuration: defining widget metadata and documentation paths.\n- It uses `sysconfig.get_path('data')` to dynamically obtain a directory path for documentation files.\n- There are no user inputs, network operations, or code execution beyond standard library calls.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines constants and uses `sysconfig.get_path('data')` for dynamic path retrieval.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware is present; all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign obfuscated score 0.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks identified; all reports assign security risk 0.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is straightforward and serves configuration purposes.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with one report at 0.9, which is acceptable given the straightforward nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- All reports are consistent, and their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The only minor note is that some reports mention \"comments indicating development\" or \"placeholder paths,\" but these are benign and typical in configuration code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores seem appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n- **Risk justification:** Since all evidence points to benign configuration code, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is simple, static configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of `sysconfig.get_path()` is standard practice for dynamic path retrieval and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security issues are present, and the current scoring reflects this appropriately.",
