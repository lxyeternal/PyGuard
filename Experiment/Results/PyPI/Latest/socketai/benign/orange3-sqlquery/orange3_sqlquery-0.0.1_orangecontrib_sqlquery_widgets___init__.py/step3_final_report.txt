  "purpose": "Define widget metadata and documentation paths for the SQLQuery widget, utilizing dynamic data directory retrieval.",
  "sources": "sysconfig.get_path('data') used to obtain data directory paths for documentation URLs and file paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of documentation URLs and paths; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration code with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sysconfig, retrieves data directory paths dynamically, and constructs documentation URLs and paths. It contains no user input, network activity, code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to zero. The use of sysconfig.get_path('data') is standard practice and does not introduce security concerns. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration for widget metadata and documentation paths, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The code is safe and requires no modifications.",
