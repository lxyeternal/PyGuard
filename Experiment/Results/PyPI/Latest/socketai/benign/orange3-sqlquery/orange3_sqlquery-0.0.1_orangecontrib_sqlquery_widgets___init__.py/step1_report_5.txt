  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data usage or output.",
  "flows": "sysconfig.get_path('data') → string formatting for documentation URL.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of sysconfig.get_path is benign; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sysconfig to determine paths for documentation, either local or online. It defines constants related to a widget's metadata and documentation locations. All paths are either hardcoded or dynamically retrieved using sysconfig, with no user input, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The structure appears typical for configuration, with no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as metadata setup for a widget, with safe use of standard library functions and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
