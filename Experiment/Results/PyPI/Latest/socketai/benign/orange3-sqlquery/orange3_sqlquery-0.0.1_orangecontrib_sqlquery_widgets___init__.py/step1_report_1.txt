  "sources": "sysconfig.get_path('data') for dynamic documentation path retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of documentation path using sysconfig.get_path() with string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sysconfig.get_path() with string formatting to generate a URL path is generally safe; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and documentation paths for a widget. It uses sysconfig.get_path('data') to dynamically determine the data directory, then formats it into URLs for local help files and online documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and only involves static assignment and standard library calls.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving only to define metadata and documentation links for the widget. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
