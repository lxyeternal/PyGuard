{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the current package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically via __import__ and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations are present; thus, no sinks exist.",
  "flows": "The source (__import__('pkg_resources')) leads directly to declare_namespace(__name__), with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string argument is somewhat unusual but known in namespace declarations; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration pattern in Python, involving dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' and calling declare_namespace(__name__). It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute malicious logic. The pattern is well-understood and common in older setuptools-based packages. No anomalies, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code is minimal, clear, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
