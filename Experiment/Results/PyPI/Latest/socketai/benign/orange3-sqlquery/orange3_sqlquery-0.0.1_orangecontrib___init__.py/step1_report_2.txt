  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the pkg_resources module to declare a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources and declaring namespace; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual behavior. Declaring namespace is a common pattern in namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically using __import__, then calls declare_namespace with __name__. This pattern is typical for namespace packages, enabling multiple distributions to share a common namespace. There is no use of hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious constructs. The code does not perform any data processing or external communication. The minimal nature suggests it's a standard namespace declaration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
