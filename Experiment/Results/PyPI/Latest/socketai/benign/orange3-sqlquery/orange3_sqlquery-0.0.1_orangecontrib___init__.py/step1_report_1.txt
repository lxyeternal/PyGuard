  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path; the code only performs a namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of namespace declaration in a minimal code snippet; no apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and invokes 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a standard method for declaring namespace packages in Python. There are no inputs, no data handling, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is concise and performs a known, safe operation related to package namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
