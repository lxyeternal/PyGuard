  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and calls a function with a static argument; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. It involves no data input, output, or execution of untrusted code. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration used in Python packaging. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
