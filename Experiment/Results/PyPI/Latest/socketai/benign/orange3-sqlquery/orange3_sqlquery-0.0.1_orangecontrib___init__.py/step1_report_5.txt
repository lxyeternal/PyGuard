  "purpose": "Namespace declaration for a package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkg_resources' and declares namespace, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is a standard namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current namespace as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python for defining namespace packages, especially with the 'pkg_resources' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code is minimal and performs a standard namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources' with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a common pattern in Python package development.",
