{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__) statement, which imports the pkg_resources module and calls declare_namespace with the current module name.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data or sensitive information is accessed or written.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__ with a string argument is somewhat unusual but is a known pattern for namespace declaration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module dynamically and calls declare_namespace with the current module's name. This pattern is typical for defining namespace packages, especially in older setuptools-based distributions. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or privilege escalation. The code is minimal and focused solely on namespace declaration without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a common pattern in Python packaging and does not pose a security threat.",
