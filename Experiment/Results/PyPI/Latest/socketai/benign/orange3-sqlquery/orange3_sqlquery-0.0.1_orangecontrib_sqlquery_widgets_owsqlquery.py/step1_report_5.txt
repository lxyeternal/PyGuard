{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GUI widget for performing SQL queries on multiple input tables within the Orange data analysis framework.",
  "sources": "Input tables from connected Orange data ports; SQL query string from user input textbox.",
  "sinks": "The execution of the SQL query on the DuckDB in-memory database; outputting the resulting table.",
  "flows": "Input tables are registered in DuckDB as variables; user-provided SQL query runs against these tables; result is fetched and converted back to Orange Table for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures detected. The code uses standard database operations and UI elements. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The widget safely registers input tables into an in-memory DuckDB instance and executes user-supplied SQL queries. The process involves typical data handling and database querying routines, with no evident malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system damage. Error handling is limited to displaying exceptions related to query execution. There are no signs of backdoors or covert data leaks. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a SQL query interface within the Orange framework, utilizing established libraries and practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a GUI widget for SQL querying of input tables in Orange. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. It handles user data and query execution in a typical manner with no suspicious operations.",
