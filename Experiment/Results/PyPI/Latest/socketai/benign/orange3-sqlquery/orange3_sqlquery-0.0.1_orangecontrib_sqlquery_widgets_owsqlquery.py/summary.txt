  "conclusion": "The widget performs standard SQL query execution on input tables with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk stems from executing untrusted SQL, which is inherent to such tools but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the risk score around 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential for misuse but not active malicious behavior."
