  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the reported concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The widget executes user-defined SQL queries on multiple input tables via DuckDB. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the inherent risk of executing arbitrary SQL input.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** The code matches the description; it registers input tables and executes user SQL.\n  - **Malicious behavior:** None observed.\n  - **Security risk:** Low (0.2), mainly due to user-controlled SQL input.\n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the risk of malicious SQL commands being executed without validation. The risk score is higher (0.4), reflecting potential for data leakage or harmful queries.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code behavior:** Same as above; executes arbitrary SQL.\n  - **Malicious code:** Not present; no backdoors or malicious code snippets.\n  - **Security concern:** The potential for malicious SQL is inherent but not actualized in the code.\n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4 — justified given the nature of SQL execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar functionality. The concern is the lack of sanitization, but no malicious code is present.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code:** Matches description.\n  - **Malicious activity:** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same core logic; execution of arbitrary SQL with no validation, but no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Behavior:** Consistent with code.\n  - **Malicious code:** Absent.\n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward, no malicious code, standard database operations.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Behavior:** As described.\n  - **Malicious activity:** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report or the source code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware:** Not present.\n- **Security risk:** The main concern is executing arbitrary SQL input, which is inherently risky but not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** can be **around 0.2 to 0.4**, reflecting the potential dangers of executing untrusted SQL code, but not indicating active malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (since the code allows arbitrary SQL execution, which is a security concern but not malware)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is inherent to the functionality but not malicious. The scores should remain low, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero.",
