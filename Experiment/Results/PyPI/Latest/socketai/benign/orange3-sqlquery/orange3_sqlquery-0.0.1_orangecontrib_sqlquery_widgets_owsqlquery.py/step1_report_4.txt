  "purpose": "This code defines a GUI widget for performing SQL queries on multiple input tables within an Orange data analysis environment.",
  "sources": "Input tables received via the set_inputX methods; user-input SQL query from QTextEdit widget",
  "sinks": "Execution of the user-provided SQL query via duckdb's execute method, which processes the query on registered tables",
  "flows": "Input tables are registered into an in-memory duckdb database; user-entered SQL query from the textbox is executed on these tables; the resulting DataFrame is converted back into an Orange Table and output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code handles database connections and data transformations in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a GUI with input port handlers for multiple tables, allowing dynamic table registration. User-entered SQL is executed directly on these tables using duckdb, which can process arbitrary SQL queries. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or reverse shells. The only potential risk is the execution of arbitrary SQL code, which is expected behavior for this widget. No malicious or sabotage code is present. The code appears legitimate, focusing on data manipulation within a controlled environment. All inputs and data flows are contained within memory, with no external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard, controlled SQL execution widget for data analysis without any malicious intent or malicious code. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or external data exfiltration. The only security consideration is that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be dangerous if untrusted code is input, but within the context of this widget, it is expected functionality.",
