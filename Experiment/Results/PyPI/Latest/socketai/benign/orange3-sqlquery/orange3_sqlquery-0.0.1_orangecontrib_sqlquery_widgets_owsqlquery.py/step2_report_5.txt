  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The widget executes user-entered SQL on multiple input tables via DuckDB. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Risks stem from arbitrary SQL execution, which is typical for such tools.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — considering the inherent risk of executing arbitrary SQL, this seems reasonable but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's behavior is transparent, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential data leakage via malicious SQL commands. No validation or sanitization is performed.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware, but the risk of malicious SQL is acknowledged.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — increased due to the potential for malicious SQL commands to access or manipulate data.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate. The risk score reflects the danger of executing untrusted SQL, but there's no evidence of actual malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that arbitrary SQL can be executed; no malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the lack of validation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher than previous, perhaps considering the potential for malicious input.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — consistent with the previous report, acknowledging the risk.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slight increase in malware score is justifiable but still indicates no actual malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main concern is the execution of arbitrary SQL.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — considering the potential risks but no active malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Reasoning is solid; the code is straightforward and transparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard behavior with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Risks are typical for user-defined SQL execution.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — same as others, acknowledging the risk inherent in executing arbitrary SQL.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Vary between 0.2 and 0.4, reflecting the inherent risk of executing arbitrary user SQL. This is reasonable, though some might argue that 0.2 is conservative given the potential for malicious SQL commands.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard GUI widget for executing user-defined SQL queries on input tables within the Orange environment.\n\n- There is **no evidence of malware**, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- The **security risk** stems from the potential misuse of arbitrary SQL execution, which is an accepted trade-off for such tools. The scores assigned (0.2 to 0.4) are appropriate.\n\n- **No changes needed** in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Justification                                                                                   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated     | 0 — Clear, straightforward code.                                                                |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2 to 0.4 — Reflects the inherent risk of executing arbitrary SQL without validation.       |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-reasoned. The code itself does not pose a malware threat but carries typical risks associated with executing user-provided SQL.",
