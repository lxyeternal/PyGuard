  "purpose": "A GUI widget for executing user-defined SQL queries on multiple input tables within the Orange data analysis environment.",
  "sources": "Input tables received via multiple ports; user enters SQL query in the text box.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-provided SQL query on registered in-memory DuckDB tables; results output as Orange Table.",
  "flows": "Input tables are registered in DuckDB; user SQL query is executed on these tables; resulting DataFrame is converted back to Orange Table and sent to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. No sanitization or validation of SQL input is performed, which is a known risk but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code registers multiple input tables into an in-memory DuckDB database, then executes arbitrary SQL provided by the user without sanitization. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the execution of untrusted SQL, which could lead to data leaks or manipulation, but this is inherent to the widget's functionality. The code is straightforward and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 to 0.4) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The widget performs standard SQL query execution on input tables with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk stems from executing untrusted SQL, which is inherent to such tools but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the risk score around 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential for misuse but not active malicious behavior.",
