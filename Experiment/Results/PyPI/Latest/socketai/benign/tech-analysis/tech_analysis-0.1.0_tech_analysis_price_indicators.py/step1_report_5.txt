{
  "purpose": "This code implements various technical analysis indicators used in financial trading strategies, such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and others, likely for analyzing stock or asset price data.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'prices', 'highs', 'lows', 'closes', which are read from external sources and passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform computations on these inputs without writing or transmitting data externally, but they do involve mathematical operations that could be exploited if input data is maliciously crafted (e.g., causing computational issues). There are no network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations like moving averages, differences, and ratios within each function; there are no untrusted data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears straightforward, utilizing standard mathematical formulas for financial indicators. No suspicious imports or code injection points are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for technical analysis: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, stochastic oscillator, Williams R, ATR, ROC, TRIX, and CCI. All functions process numerical input data using standard formulas without any external calls, dynamic code execution, or side effects. The use of 'core' module functions 'sma', 'ema' is consistent with typical dependency usage for mathematical computations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure is clear, with no obfuscated code, and no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of standard financial indicator calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate module for technical analysis purposes, relying solely on mathematical processing of input data. No malicious activities, security risks, or obfuscated code are present.",
