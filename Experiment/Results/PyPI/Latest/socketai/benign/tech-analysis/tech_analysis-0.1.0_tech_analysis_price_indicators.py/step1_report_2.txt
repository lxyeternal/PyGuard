{
  "purpose": "The code provides implementations of various technical analysis indicators used in financial data analysis and trading strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as prices, highs, lows, and closes provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process input data internally; no sinks involving untrusted data or external data output are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations within each function; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of standard mathematical and statistical calculations appears normal. No obfuscated or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of technical indicator calculations for financial analysis, relying solely on mathematical operations and list processing. It imports 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core', likely a library or module, but their usage seems appropriate. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are evident. No unusual patterns, such as dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors, are present. The functions perform standard calculations for indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams R, ATR, ROC, TRIX, and CCI, with proper handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero, insufficient data).",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of technical analysis indicators with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It serves a legitimate purpose for financial data analysis and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
