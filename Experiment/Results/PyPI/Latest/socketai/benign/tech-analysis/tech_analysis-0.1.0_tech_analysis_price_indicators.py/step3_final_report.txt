  "purpose": "Implementation of various financial technical indicators for analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data such as prices, highs, lows, and closes; imported functions 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; calculations are performed locally without data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through mathematical calculations within each function, with no external or untrusted data affecting control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper handling of edge cases like division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard financial indicators with correct formulas and edge case handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. Dependency on 'core' functions is assumed legitimate. No external network or system calls are made. The code processes data locally and safely, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of technical analysis indicators. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.0–0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
