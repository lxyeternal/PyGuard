{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations of various technical analysis indicators used in financial trading strategies.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters: prices, highs, lows, closes, and other related data series.",
  "sinks": "Calculates and returns indicator values; no direct sinks like network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical computations to output indicator series.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Usage of common financial formulas appears legitimate. No obfuscated or misleading code features. No external system calls or network operations. The code uses only standard calculations for technical analysis, with no hidden data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core'—assumed to be legitimate, standard functions. All functions perform standard calculations for financial indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams R, ATR, ROC, TRIX, and CCI. No dynamic code execution, eval calls, or obfuscated logic. No suspicious data handling, credential usage, or network activity. The computations involve mathematical operations only and are consistent with typical implementations. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of financial technical indicators with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is benign, serving analytical purposes only.",
