{
  "purpose": "This code provides various technical analysis functions for financial data, including calculations for RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams R, ATR, ROC, TRIX, and CCI, to assist in trading or market analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data such as 'prices', 'highs', 'lows', 'closes' from function arguments; these are supplied externally when functions are called.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions perform data leaks, network communication, or system modifications. No untrusted data is sent outside the process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through calculations like moving averages, standard deviations, and min/max functions, ending in returned analysis results; no untrusted or external outputs are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code consists solely of standard mathematical computations for technical indicators. No suspicious imports or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sma' and 'ema' from a module named 'core', and uses them throughout; no suspicious import behavior or dynamic code execution is present. All calculations are standard for financial indicators, with proper handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero). There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious side effects, or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward and serve a clear analytical purpose. The code does not attempt to read or write sensitive data, nor does it perform network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of legitimate technical analysis functions without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The code is well-structured, uses standard computations, and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
