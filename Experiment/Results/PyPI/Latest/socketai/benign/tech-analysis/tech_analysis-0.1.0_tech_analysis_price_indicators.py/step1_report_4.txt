{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations of various technical analysis indicators used in trading strategies, such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams R, ATR, ROC, TRIX, and CCI.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters: prices, highs, lows, closes, which are supplied externally when functions are called.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any suspicious sinks that send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (prices, highs, lows, closes) into calculations within each function, with intermediate variables for calculations such as gains, losses, standard deviations, etc., but no untrusted data is used in insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. All computations are standard for technical analysis. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious imports are used.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sma', 'ema' from 'core', likely standard or open-source implementations of simple and exponential moving averages. It processes input data to compute standard trading indicators. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The functions handle numerical calculations using typical mathematical formulas for each indicator, with appropriate handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero). All data is processed locally, and no external or untrusted sources are invoked during runtime. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of technical analysis indicators without any malicious intent. It functions solely to process market data for analysis purposes. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is evident based on the provided code.",
