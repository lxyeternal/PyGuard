  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the key points:\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code implements standard financial technical indicators.\n- The code imports 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core', assumed to be legitimate functions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- No external network, file, or system calls are present.\n- The calculations are mathematically standard, with proper handling of edge cases.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of common indicators. No issues like malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are evident.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code and the standard implementation of indicators.\n\n- **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The security risk scores are also very low, reflecting no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis & Recommendations:\n\n**Malware Score Justification:**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. No code suggests data exfiltration, network activity, or sabotage.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified. No obfuscation techniques are present.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n\n- The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). This is reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n\n- The only external dependency is 'core' with 'sma' and 'ema'. If these are malicious or compromised, that could introduce risk, but based on the reports, this is not indicated.\n- The functions handle data safely, with proper checks for division by zero and insufficient data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Are there any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is standard, with no suspicious features.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimate:**\n\n| Score Type          | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score       | **0.0**           | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated Score    | **0.0**           | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk Score | **0.1**           | Very low; standard calculations with proper handling.       |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe and suitable for supply chain use without concern for malicious activity or obfuscation.",
