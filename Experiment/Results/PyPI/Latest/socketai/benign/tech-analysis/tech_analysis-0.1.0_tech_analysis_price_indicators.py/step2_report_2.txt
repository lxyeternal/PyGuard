  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code performs standard financial technical indicator calculations.\n- No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are identified across reports.\n- The code relies on 'sma' and 'ema' functions from a 'core' module, assumed to be standard.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The reasoning is consistent, and the confidence levels are high.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of standard indicator calculations:** The functions implement well-known formulas with proper handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero).\n- **No malicious or suspicious behavior detected:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Dependency on 'core' module:** Assumed to be legitimate; no indication of malicious behavior from this.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning:\n\n- **No significant logical flaws:** The implementations appear correct and standard.\n- **Potential minor improvements:** Some functions could optimize or clarify, but these are not security issues.\n- **No misinterpretation or incorrect assumptions:** All reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation (0.0 to 0.1), but generally low, reflecting no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No issues warranting a high risk score are present.\n- The code is purely computational, with no network, file, or system modifications.\n- The potential for misuse exists only if malicious input data causes computational errors, but this is a standard concern and not indicative of malicious code.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reliance on 'core' module functions 'sma' and 'ema' could be a concern if 'core' is compromised, but based on the reports, there's no evidence of this.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or external calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- Security risk scores are low, which is appropriate.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation and recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category          | Suggested Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0               | Clear, straightforward implementation.                                       |\n| Security Risk     | 0.0 – 0.1         | Minimal risk; standard calculations with no external dependencies or side effects. |\n\n**Note:** Slightly higher scores (up to 0.1) could be justified if considering the dependency on 'core', but without evidence of compromise, 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code is benign, standard, and well-implemented.**\n- **No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**\n- **Scores assigned in reports are reasonable and consistent.**\n- **No modifications needed unless further context about 'core' is provided.**\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with scores of 0.0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk score (around 0.0–0.1).",
