{
  "purpose": "Calculates simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' which is a list of numerical data points, and 'period' which is a numerical value for window size.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed sequentially to produce SMA and EMA values; no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for calculating SMA and EMA on numerical data. The logic is straightforward and typical for financial calculations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or harmful side effects. No external calls, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign and solely focused on computing financial indicators. No malicious or suspicious activity is identified.",
