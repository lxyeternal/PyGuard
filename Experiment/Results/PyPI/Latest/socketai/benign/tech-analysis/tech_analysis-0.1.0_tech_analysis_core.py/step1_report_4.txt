{
  "purpose": "The code calculates Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for a given dataset, likely for financial or data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from the 'data' parameter, which is expected to be a list of numerical values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is sent outside the functions; the code performs purely computational operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' input through the SMA and EMA calculations, resulting in lists of computed moving averages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code performs standard calculations without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'sma' and 'ema', which compute moving averages. The functions utilize straightforward list comprehensions and loops, with no external network or system interactions. No use of environment variables, file I/O, or external commands is evident. The calculations are standard and do not exhibit malicious patterns. The code is well-structured, with clear logic for the intended calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic financial data calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate utility code for computing moving averages. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
