  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, performing standard financial calculations.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are detected.\n- Malware scores are all zero, and the reasoning aligns with benign code.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; code calculates SMA and EMA, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. \n- **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, detailed and correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar, standard calculations.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1, slightly higher, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, straightforward code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 1, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- The confidence levels are high, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1 is appropriate; some reports assign 0.1 perhaps to account for minimal risk in case of future misuse, but given the current analysis, 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is standard, benign, and does not pose security threats.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
