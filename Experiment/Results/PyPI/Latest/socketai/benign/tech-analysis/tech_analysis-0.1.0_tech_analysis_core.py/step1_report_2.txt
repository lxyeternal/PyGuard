  "purpose": "Calculate simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for financial data series.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' (a list of numerical values), 'period' (an integer).",
  "sinks": "Return values of moving averages; no external sinks or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through calculations to return values; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs standard financial calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'sma' and 'ema'. 'sma' computes a simple moving average over a specified period, returning a list with None for indices before the period. 'ema' calculates an exponential moving average, initializing the first value as the first data point and iteratively applying the EMA formula. Both functions use standard list comprehensions and loops with straightforward calculations. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be for financial analysis without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard financial indicator calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is minimal.",
