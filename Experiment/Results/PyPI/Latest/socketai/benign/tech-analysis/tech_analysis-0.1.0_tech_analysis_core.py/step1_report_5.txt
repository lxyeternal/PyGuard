{
  "purpose": "The code computes Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for a given dataset, likely for financial or signal analysis.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'data' in both functions, which is a list of numerical values.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or write output to external sources; functions return computed lists locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through calculations to output lists; no external data manipulation or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward mathematical calculations without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement standard SMA and EMA calculations. No input validation or sanitization is performed, but that is typical for such mathematical functions. No external dependencies, no file I/O, network access, or environment variable usage. The code appears to be a basic implementation for computing moving averages. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are self-contained and do not perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of financial technical analysis functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted external input beyond the input parameter and does not perform any external actions. Overall, it appears benign and suitable for use in data analysis contexts.",
