  "purpose": "Functions to compute Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data list 'data' for both functions.",
  "sinks": "Return of computed lists; no external data sinks or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into calculations within each function; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SMA and EMA calculations with straightforward logic, no external dependencies, network activity, or malicious constructs. The functions operate solely on numerical data, returning computed lists. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for financial data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard financial calculations, and poses no security threats or malicious intent. The existing reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0, obfuscation scores at 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the benign and straightforward nature of the code, the minimal security risk scores can be confidently set to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports are justified.",
