{
  "purpose": "Calculate simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for a dataset, likely for financial or data analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'data' which is a list of numerical values.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing the computed moving averages; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through calculations in 'sma' and 'ema' functions, resulting in output lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for calculating SMA and EMA, both straightforward mathematical computations. The 'sma' function sums slices of the data list, dividing by the period, while 'ema' computes a weighted exponential average using a standard formula. Both functions only process numerical data and return results directly. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for data analysis purposes and does not include obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing common financial calculations without any malicious intent. No security threats or malware behaviors are evident.",
