  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'tech_analysis'.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from 'README.md' and gathers package information via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; the script primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; 'open' reads from local filesystem, and dependencies are specified explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without exception handling; standard setup code with no suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the README file to provide a long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
