{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tech_analysis' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from variables and a README.md file; also specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. No untrusted data handling or output is visible.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads static metadata and the README file; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of open() to read 'README.md' is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions to define package configuration. It sets static metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, and dependencies. The only file operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is standard practice. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. No potential security issues or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks.",
