  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads static file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools. It performs static operations: defining package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The use of open() for reading README.md is standard, with minimal risk. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. Slightly elevated risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are overly cautious but acceptable; overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
