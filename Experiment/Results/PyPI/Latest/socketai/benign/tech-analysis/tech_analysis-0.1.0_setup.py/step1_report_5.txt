  "sources": "Reading the package's README file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is static and does not execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads the README.md file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. Dependencies are standard and benign. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
