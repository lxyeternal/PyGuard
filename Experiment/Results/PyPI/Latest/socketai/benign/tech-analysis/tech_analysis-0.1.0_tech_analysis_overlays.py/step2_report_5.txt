  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions for moving averages and Donchian channels, importing 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core'. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware indicated.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears straightforward, standard in financial analysis, with no malicious intent. The 'malware' score is 0, and 'obfuscated' is 0, which is consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 seems slightly high given the lack of any suspicious behavior, but perhaps it's a default minimal risk.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard functions, no anomalies, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; scores are consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard calculations, imported 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core', no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; scores align.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard financial indicator functions, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators; scores consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is acceptable given the consistency.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** The security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0.0). Given the code's purpose (financial indicators) and lack of suspicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a standard implementation of financial indicators, relying on trusted external functions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned in each report are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, default low risk for such code, but could be 0 given no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and aligns with standard financial analysis practices.\n- The scoring reflects this accurately.\n- No further action required.",
