  "purpose": "Calculates moving averages and Donchian channels for financial data analysis using trusted external functions.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays: 'prices', 'highs', 'lows'; external functions 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "None; code performs computations only, no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data -> 'sma'/'ema' functions -> computed values; no untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted functions for simple and exponential moving averages, then defines functions that process input data to produce indicator values. The logic is standard, with no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. External functions 'sma' and 'ema' are assumed benign; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose is clear and typical for financial analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate given the context. No further action required.",
