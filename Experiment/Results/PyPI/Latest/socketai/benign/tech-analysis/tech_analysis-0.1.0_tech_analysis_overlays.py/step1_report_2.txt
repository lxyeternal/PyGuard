  "purpose": "Calculate moving averages and Donchian channels for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'prices', 'highs', and 'lows' data inputs provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed moving averages and channel bounds; no data is written or transmitted externally within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data (prices, highs, lows) flows into functions; results are generated without further external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard list comprehensions and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: 'moving_average_overlay' and 'exponential_moving_average_overlay' compute simple and exponential moving averages respectively using imported 'sma' and 'ema' functions. These functions appear straightforward and utilize parameters to process input price data. The 'donchian_channel' function calculates upper and lower bounds based on maximum and minimum values over a sliding window, with checks to assign 'None' for insufficient data points at the start. All operations are typical for financial data analysis and do not involve obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No external network calls, credential handling, or potentially malicious operations are present. The code relies on external, presumably benign, 'core' library functions, which are standard in trading algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard financial calculations with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It is typical in structure and purpose for data analysis purposes.",
