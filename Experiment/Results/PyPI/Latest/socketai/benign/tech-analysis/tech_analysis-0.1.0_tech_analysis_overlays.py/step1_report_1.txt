  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating moving averages and Donchian channels for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Inputs: prices, highs, lows, period parameters.",
  "sinks": "Returns: dictionaries of moving averages and channel boundaries; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Inputs are used directly in calculations; outputs are derived from trusted mathematical functions; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; no obfuscated or unusual code structures. Uses standard data processing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core functions 'sma' and 'ema', which are presumed to be standard or trusted implementations for simple and exponential moving averages. It defines functions that compute moving averages over specified periods and a Donchian channel, which calculates upper and lower bounds based on max/min over a sliding window. The code employs list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions for clarity. No signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs, are present. The functions rely solely on mathematical operations with passed-in data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of financial indicator calculations with no malicious intent. It uses standard techniques and trusted external functions, with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
