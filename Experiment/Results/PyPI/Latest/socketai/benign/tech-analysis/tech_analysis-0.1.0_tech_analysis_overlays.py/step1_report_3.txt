{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating moving averages and Donchian channels, likely for financial analysis or trading strategies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'prices', 'highs', 'lows', and 'period'.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported functions 'sma' and 'ema' from 'core' module; data outputs are return values of these functions and calculated upper/lower channels.",
  "flows": "Input data (prices, highs, lows) flows into moving average functions and Donchian channel calculations, with results returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for financial computations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions 'sma' and 'ema' from a local 'core' module, then defines three functions: 'moving_average_overlay', 'exponential_moving_average_overlay', and 'donchian_channel'. These functions perform standard financial calculations: moving averages and Donchian channels, with no signs of malicious intent. The functions operate purely on input data, without external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The logic is transparent and typical for technical analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements common financial indicator calculations with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
