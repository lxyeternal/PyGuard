  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward, uses trusted functions, and performs standard calculations.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard financial indicator calculations.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, standard functions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem fine.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains a typical implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.0). Given the code is purely computational and does not involve external communications, I would consider the risk to be very low, possibly 0 or 0.05.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware** scores are appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are appropriate.\n- The **securityRisk** scores could be lowered slightly to 0, as there's no apparent risk beyond standard computational functions.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05, but 0 is justified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for financial data analysis. The current scores are reasonable, but I suggest reducing the security risk score to 0 for an even more accurate reflection of the minimal risk involved.",
