{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute moving averages and Donchian channels for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sma' and 'ema' from the 'core' module; reads input data through function parameters: prices, highs, lows.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; no data output or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input data (prices, highs, lows) flows into functions; outputs are computed dictionaries or tuples; no external untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward implementation; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, 'sma' and 'ema', likely standard indicators, from a module named 'core'. The functions generate moving average overlays and Donchian channels based on input data. All code appears typical for financial analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The logic is clear, with no dynamic code execution or hidden operations. The data processing is straightforward and lacks any suspicious network activity or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard financial analysis code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external functions 'sma' and 'ema' but does not include any suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads.",
