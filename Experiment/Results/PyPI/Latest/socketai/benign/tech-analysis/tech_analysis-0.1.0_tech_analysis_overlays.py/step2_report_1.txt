  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code imports 'sma' and 'ema' from a 'core' module, which are presumably standard or trusted implementations for calculating simple and exponential moving averages.\n- Defines functions for calculating moving averages and Donchian channels based solely on input data.\n- Uses straightforward list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.\n- No network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The logic is transparent and typical for financial indicator calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of Malicious Code:**\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The code is purely computational, with no network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in the Report's Logic:**\n- No errors are evident in the code itself.\n- The reports correctly identify the functions as standard and straightforward.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- The reports assign `securityRisk` scores around 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature of the code.\n- The report with a `confidence` of 0.9 or 1. appropriately reflects high confidence in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The malware score of 0 aligns with the lack of malicious indicators. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities justified?**  \n  No. The code does not contain vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior. The reports' conclusions are justified.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, typical for financial calculation code)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard, relies on external trusted functions, and performs common financial calculations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious behavior or payloads detected.                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    | Low risk due to standard data processing; no vulnerabilities. |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
