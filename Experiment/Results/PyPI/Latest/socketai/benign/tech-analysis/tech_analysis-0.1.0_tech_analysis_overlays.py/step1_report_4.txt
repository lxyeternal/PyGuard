{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating moving averages and Donchian channels, likely for technical analysis in trading.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data: prices, highs, and lows, supplied as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculations to produce moving averages and channel bounds; no external or untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. The code uses standard mathematical operations and list comprehensions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a 'core' module, presumably for statistical calculations. It defines functions to compute simple moving averages, exponential moving averages, and Donchian channels, all based on input data provided as arguments. The calculations appear straightforward and appropriate for their intended purposes. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features are present. The logic is clear, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of technical analysis functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input data to generate indicators commonly used in trading strategies.",
