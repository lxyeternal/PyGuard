  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of candlestick pattern recognition functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis."
