{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement various candlestick pattern recognition functions for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "The functions process input data such as open, high, low, and close prices, provided as arrays or lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; the code mainly performs computations and returns boolean or string results.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculations in each function, resulting in pattern detection flags; no external data or untrusted sources are actively involved in control or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous pattern recognition functions with similar structure, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code features or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing multiple candlestick pattern detection algorithms based on input arrays. It uses simple arithmetic, comparisons, and loops. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be designed solely for technical analysis of stock data. The functions are well-structured and perform calculations typical in financial analysis. No external libraries or unsafe coding practices are evident. The overall structure suggests intent for legitimate data analysis rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely performs candlestick pattern recognition with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. It appears to be a legitimate implementation for financial data analysis. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malware risk based on the provided code.",
