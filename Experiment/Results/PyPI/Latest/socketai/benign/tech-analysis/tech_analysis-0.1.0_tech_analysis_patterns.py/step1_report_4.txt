{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to identify various candlestick patterns and technical analysis signals in financial market data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: open_, close, high, low, and thresholds. These are used for pattern detection and calculations.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally; no direct data leaks or network operations are present. No sinks involve untrusted data leading to security effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through pattern detection logic, returning boolean lists indicating pattern presence. No untrusted data is used in security-sensitive contexts.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of pattern detection algorithms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. No unusual language features or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements candlestick pattern recognition without external input handling or network operations. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The functions are standard pattern recognitions, with no hidden or obfuscated code. The functions use straightforward calculations and logic consistent with technical analysis libraries. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. The code is well-structured, with clear logic, and appears to be a legitimate technical analysis tool.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of technical analysis pattern detection functions with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs pattern recognition purely on supplied market data. No malicious or sabotage elements detected.",
