  "purpose": "This code provides functions for identifying various candlestick patterns and technical analysis signals in financial trading data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arrays representing open, high, low, close prices, which are passed as arguments to the functions.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are present; functions return boolean lists or string labels based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through pattern detection logic, resulting in boolean or string outputs indicating pattern presence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. Functions are pure and focus on pattern recognition.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements candlestick pattern recognition algorithms without any network communication, system modification, or suspicious side-effects. All data processing is confined to array inputs, and no external calls or environment manipulations are observed. The functions are standard pattern recognition implementations with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code appears benign, serving its purpose of technical analysis without incorporating any malicious payloads or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of pattern recognition functions for financial data analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is straightforward, pure, and focused solely on pattern detection. No malicious or maliciously crafted code is detected.",
