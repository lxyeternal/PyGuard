  "purpose": "Collection of candlestick pattern recognition functions analyzing financial market data based on open, high, low, and close prices.",
  "sources": "Input arrays for open, high, low, close prices; no external data sources or system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Pure data processing within functions; no external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed through logical and arithmetic operations within each function; no external or untrusted data flows outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward, deterministic functions for pattern detection in financial data. It uses simple arithmetic comparisons and logical conditions without external dependencies or side effects. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions operate solely on numerical input arrays, with no network or system interactions. The code's clarity and purpose align with standard technical analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of candlestick pattern recognition functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
