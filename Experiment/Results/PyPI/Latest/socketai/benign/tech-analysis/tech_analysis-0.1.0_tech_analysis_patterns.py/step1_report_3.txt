{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of functions to identify various candlestick and technical analysis patterns in financial data, such as doji, hammer, engulfing, harami, star formations, and breakout signals.",
  "sources": "Functions read data from input lists: open_, close, high, low, which are sequences of numerical values representing stock prices.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks like network, file, or system commands; however, if these functions are integrated into larger systems, their output could influence trading decisions or be used for automated trading actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input lists through pattern detection logic, resulting in boolean lists indicating pattern presence; no external data manipulation or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for technical pattern detection; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. All functions follow predictable pattern-matching logic. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of candlestick and chart pattern recognition functions, operating purely on numerical inputs. Functions use straightforward calculations and logical conditions to identify specific patterns. No evidence of malicious activity, such as network communication, file operations, or environment manipulation, is present. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate technical analysis utilities. There are no signs of sabotage, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate set of technical analysis functions for financial data pattern detection. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
