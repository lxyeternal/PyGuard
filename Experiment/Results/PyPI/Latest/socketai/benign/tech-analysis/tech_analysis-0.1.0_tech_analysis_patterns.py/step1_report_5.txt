{
  "purpose": "The code defines various functions for detecting candlestick patterns and technical analysis signals in financial market data.",
  "sources": "The functions read data from input parameters such as open_, close, high, low arrays, which are expected to be numeric lists representing market prices.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform calculations and return boolean lists or categorical signals; no untrusted data output, external communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within functions to produce pattern detection signals; there are no external data flows or untrusted data sinks such as network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is purely analytical, with straightforward logic. No obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of pattern detection functions for candlestick analysis, all operating on numeric input arrays. No input validation, external data fetching, or side effects are present. The functions do not include any code that sends data externally, executes system commands, or manipulates files. The structure is consistent and clear, focused solely on calculations related to technical analysis patterns. There is no suspicious logic or anomalies that suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of candlestick pattern recognition functions used in technical analysis. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
