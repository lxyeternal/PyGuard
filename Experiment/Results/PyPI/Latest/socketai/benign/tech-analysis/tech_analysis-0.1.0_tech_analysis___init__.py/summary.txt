  "malware_score": 0.4,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that could be malicious, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion without confirmation. The overall security risk is elevated but not critical, warranting cautious review before deployment."
