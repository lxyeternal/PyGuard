  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving network requests, environment variables, user input, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), and obfuscation techniques.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file modifications, or environment variable access that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval()/exec() or network requests, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscation techniques, hardcoded suspicious URLs or credentials, and unusual code structures that hinder readability.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, combined with network activity, suggests potential malicious behavior. Lack of code or benign patterns in some reports reduces suspicion. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.55) in the most suspicious report are justified given the evidence. Overall, the suspicion is moderate, with no definitive malicious payload confirmed. The analysis aligns with the observed patterns and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that could be malicious, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion without confirmation. The overall security risk is elevated but not critical, warranting cautious review before deployment.",
