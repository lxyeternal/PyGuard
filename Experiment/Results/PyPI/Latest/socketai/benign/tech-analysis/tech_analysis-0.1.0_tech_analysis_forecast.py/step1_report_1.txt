{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for linear regression, moving average forecasting, mean squared error calculation, and ASCII visualization for stock data forecasting.",
  "sources": "The data input 'data' in the 'forecast_stock' function, which is used for analysis and prediction.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'forecast_stock' (actual, predicted, mse), which could potentially leak data if exposed externally. No other external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through forecasting methods (linear or moving average), then to error calculation and visualization outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code performs standard statistical operations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines standard functions for linear regression, moving average, error measurement, and visualization. The 'forecast_stock' function orchestrates these, handling basic input validation and method selection. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a legitimate statistical modeling tool for stock data without malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of stock forecasting methods with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It only processes and outputs data locally for visualization and error assessment.",
