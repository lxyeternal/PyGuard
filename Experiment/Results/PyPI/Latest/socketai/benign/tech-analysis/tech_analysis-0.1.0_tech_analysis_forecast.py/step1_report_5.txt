{
  "purpose": "The code performs stock data forecasting using linear regression or moving average methods, providing visual and numerical evaluation of the predictions.",
  "sources": "Input data parameter 'data' in forecast_stock function, user-defined method, window size.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external connections.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows into forecasting functions, calculations produce predictions and MSE, which are returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard time-series forecasting techniques with straightforward mathematical functions. It includes data validation for input size, supports two forecast methods, and provides visualization. There are no code injections, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated or misleading code is present. The functions utilize common Python idioms and are logically structured without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of basic stock forecasting methods without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
