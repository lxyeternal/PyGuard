{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for simple stock data forecasting using linear regression and moving average methods, along with visualization and error calculation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data 'data' parameter in forecast_stock function, and input parameters for methods (method, window).",
  "sinks": "Outputs forecast results, including actual and predicted values, and mean squared error; does not write to files or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into forecast_stock, which processes via linear_regression or moving_average, then computes mse and returns results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script implements basic statistical functions and a forecast pipeline with clear, standard calculations. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present; functions are straightforward. Visualization only prints ASCII art to stdout, which is benign. The code validates input data size, but does not access external sources or perform network operations. The data processing is purely in-memory and mathematically standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of simple stock forecast algorithms with visualization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious activities, data leaks, or backdoors are observed.",
