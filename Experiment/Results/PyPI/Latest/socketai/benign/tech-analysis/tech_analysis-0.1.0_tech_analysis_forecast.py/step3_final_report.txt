{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for linear regression, moving average, mean squared error, ASCII visualization, and a stock forecasting pipeline supporting multiple methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'data' list passed to 'forecast_stock'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with actual data, predictions, and MSE; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into statistical functions; predictions and actuals are returned; no external sinks or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations for time series forecasting with straightforward logic. It operates solely on in-memory data, with no external network or file I/O. The functions are well-structured, with input validation and method selection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The ASCII visualization is purely local. The security implications are minimal, with no external data leaks or malicious routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of stock forecasting methods with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the provided reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
