{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for linear regression, moving average forecasting, and visualization of stock data predictions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' parameter passed into the 'forecast_stock' function. User input is indirectly involved through method selection and window size.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include the predicted forecast data and the ASCII visualization, which are generally safe. No untrusted data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'data' parameter into forecasting functions; the forecast results are then used for visualization and error calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard statistical computations with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The script implements standard forecasting methods with straightforward calculations for linear regression, moving average, and error metrics. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions do not access environment variables, files, or network, and there are no backdoors or hidden routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of stock data forecasting techniques. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The functions are safe, well-structured, and use common statistical methods.",
