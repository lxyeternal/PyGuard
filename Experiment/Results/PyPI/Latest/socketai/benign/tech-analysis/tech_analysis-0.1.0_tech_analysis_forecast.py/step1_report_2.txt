{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for linear regression, moving average forecasting, mean squared error calculation, ASCII visualization, and stock data forecasting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'data' parameter in the 'forecast_stock' function, and user inputs for method and window size.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network, file, or environment variable interactions. The code outputs are returned as dictionaries and printed to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter through analysis functions, with calculations performed internally. There are no external data flows or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a statistical forecasting module, with no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard functions for statistical analysis and visualization, with no indication of malicious intent. Input validation is minimal but appropriate for its purpose. The functions operate solely on provided data, with no network or file system interactions. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with typical data analysis scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign statistical forecasting module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data analysis, visualization, and forecasting with standard methods, without any suspicious code or external interactions.",
