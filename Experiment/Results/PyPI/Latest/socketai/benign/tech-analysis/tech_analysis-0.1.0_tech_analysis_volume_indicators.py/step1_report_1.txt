{
  "purpose": "The code provides various technical analysis indicators used for stock market analysis, such as OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, and Ease of Movement.",
  "sources": "Reads input data: prices, volume, highs, lows, closes, and volumes arrays.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; functions process provided data without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through calculations within functions; no external data transmission or use of untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The calculations appear standard for technical indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code implements several standard technical analysis functions without any suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The code does not handle external inputs insecurely; it processes provided arrays for calculations only. The functions rely solely on passed parameters and perform numerical computations typical of financial analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of standard financial indicator calculations without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured and straightforward, with no signs of malware or malicious data handling.",
