  "purpose": "Implementation of standard financial technical indicators (OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, EOM) for analyzing market data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: prices, volume, highs, lows, closes, volumes (various data arrays).",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; data processed internally and returned as indicator lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations within each function, resulting in indicator value lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known financial indicators using straightforward formulas. Functions process input data arrays without external communication or side effects. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The implementation appears correct and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of financial technical indicators, free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions perform calculations solely based on input data, with no external effects or malicious actions.",
