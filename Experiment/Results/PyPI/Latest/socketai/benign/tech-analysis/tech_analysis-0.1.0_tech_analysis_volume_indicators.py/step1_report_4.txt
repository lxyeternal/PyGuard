{
  "purpose": "This code provides various technical analysis functions for financial data, such as On-Balance Volume (OBV), Price-Volume Trend (PVT), Money Flow Index (MFI), Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), and Ease of Movement (EOM).",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from parameters such as prices, volume, highs, lows, and closes, which are typically supplied externally when the functions are called.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is written out, sent over network, or stored insecurely within this code. No external communication or data exfiltration functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations within each function, with no data being sent outside or processed in insecure ways.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform standard financial calculations with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present. All functions perform straightforward mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for technical analysis using input data arrays. Each function computes indicators based on typical trading calculations. There is no use of external network calls, file I/O, or other side effects. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The structure is clear, with proper handling of typical edge cases such as division by zero or index bounds. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard financial indicator calculations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, intended solely for technical analysis purposes.",
