{
  "purpose": "The code provides financial technical indicators for analyzing stock prices and volumes, such as OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, and Ease of Movement.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include 'prices', 'volume', 'highs', 'lows', 'closes', 'volumes', which are used for calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that send data externally, nor does it process untrusted input to produce external effects.",
  "flows": "The functions process input data to compute indicator values internally without external data transmission or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears standard for technical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions implementing common technical analysis indicators. Each function processes numerical data provided as arguments, performing calculations like moving averages and ratios. There are no network calls, file I/O, or external communications. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed. Data is processed in straightforward loops, and all calculations rely solely on input parameters. The code appears to be a typical implementation of financial indicators with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of financial technical indicators with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely on input data without external communication or side effects.",
