  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently state that the code implements standard financial technical indicators (OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, EOM).\n- They mention that the code reads data from input parameters, processes it with straightforward calculations, and does not contain external data transmission, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), and all reports assign malware scores of 0.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n- **Function correctness:** The code appears to implement standard formulas correctly.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evidence of external data handling, injection, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- **Malware presence:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward implementation of common technical analysis indicators, with no issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is standard and safe.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The high confidence levels and zero malware scores are justified based on the code provided.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, which seems accurate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which seems reasonable given the code's scope.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious or suspicious behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n- The code is purely computational, with no external communication or data leakage mechanisms.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** Given the absence of any security issues, I would assign a very low risk score, e.g., **0.1**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code performs purely computational tasks.\n- No external data transmission, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- The functions are standard implementations of well-known indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No signs of malicious activity or malware.                                   |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1          | Very low risk; minimal security concern given the code's nature.            |\n\n---\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.**",
