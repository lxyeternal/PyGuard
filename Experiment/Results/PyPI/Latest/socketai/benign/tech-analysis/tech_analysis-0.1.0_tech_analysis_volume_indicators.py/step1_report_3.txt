{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating various financial technical indicators (OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, Ease of Movement) used in trading analysis.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from parameters such as prices, volume, highs, lows, and closes. No external data sources or user input are directly accessed within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data outputs, network communications, file writes, or other sinks that could be exploited for data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The data flows are confined within the functions, processing the input arrays to produce indicator values. No external or untrusted data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard implementations of technical indicators. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions that process input arrays to compute financial indicators. Each function performs mathematical calculations based solely on input parameters. No external network calls, file access, or execution of dynamic code is present. The structure is clear, and the logic aligns with standard indicator calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The implementation does not involve any obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of financial indicator calculations with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe for use in financial analysis contexts. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or sabotage mechanisms.",
