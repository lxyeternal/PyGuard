{
  "purpose": "The code provides implementations of various financial technical indicators such as OBV, PVT, MFI, Chaikin Money Flow, and Ease of Movement, likely for analysis or trading strategies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: prices, volume, highs, lows, closes, and volumes, which are assumed to be data arrays or lists provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, perform network operations, or execute external commands. It only computes and returns indicator values.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculations within each function, producing indicator lists; no external output or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. All functions perform standard financial calculations. The code appears straightforward and lacks obfuscated or misleading code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard financial indicator calculations using typical Python constructs: list comprehensions, loops, and conditional logic. It processes input lists to produce indicator lists, with boundary conditions managed (e.g., None values for initial periods). No external system calls, network activities, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses conventional formulas. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, non-malicious financial indicator functions with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs data processing only, with no external side-effects or hidden malicious code.",
