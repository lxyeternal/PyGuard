  "purpose": "Calculate the percentage change between current and previous values safely, handling division by zero.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'current' and 'previous'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement computing percentage change; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Calculation in return statement -> Output percentage change.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward arithmetic operation with division-by-zero safeguard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that computes percentage change with a conditional to prevent division by zero. All reports correctly identify it as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. No external dependencies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The function's logic is correct and safe, with no anomalies or security issues. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for percentage change calculation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
