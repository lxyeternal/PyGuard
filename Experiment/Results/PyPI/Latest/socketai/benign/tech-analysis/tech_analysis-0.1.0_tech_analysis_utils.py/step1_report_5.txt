  "purpose": "Calculate the percent change between current and previous values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'current' and 'previous' to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the computed percent change; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'current' and 'previous' flow into the calculation, which is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a simple mathematical calculation to determine percent change. It includes a check to prevent division by zero, returning 0 if 'previous' is zero or falsy. There are no external dependencies, network calls, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and lacks any malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign calculation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard utility code.",
