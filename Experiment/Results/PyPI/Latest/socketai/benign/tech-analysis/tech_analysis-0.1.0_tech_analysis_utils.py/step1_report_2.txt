  "purpose": "Calculate the percentage change between current and previous values",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'current' and 'previous' as input data",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the computed percentage change",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> calculation -> return output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple arithmetic operation with input validation for division by zero",
  "analysis": "The function performs a straightforward calculation of percentage change, with a conditional to prevent division by zero. No external input handling, environment variables, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of standard Python arithmetic and control structures indicates normal behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign utility function for percentage calculation without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
