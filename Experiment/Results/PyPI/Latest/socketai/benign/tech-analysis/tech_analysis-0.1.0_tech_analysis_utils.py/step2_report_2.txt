  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\ndef percent_change(current, previous):\n    return ((current - previous) / previous) * 100 if previous else 0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and performs a basic percentage change calculation.\n- It handles division by zero by returning 0 if `previous` is falsy (zero or None).\n- No external data sources, environment variables, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- No malware or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, simple, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, benign utility function.\n- They correctly identify the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- They all assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n- The securityRisk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any issues?**  \n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is correct; the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports; no security risk is present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of all reports, and the simplicity of the code, I would **agree with the scores assigned**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a simple, safe utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
