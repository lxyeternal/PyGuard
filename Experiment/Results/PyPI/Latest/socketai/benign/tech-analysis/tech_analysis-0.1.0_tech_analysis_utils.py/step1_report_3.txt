  "purpose": "Calculate the percent change between two numerical values.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'current' and 'previous'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; function returns a computed value.",
  "flows": "Input parameters directly influence the output; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The function computes the percentage change, with a conditional to handle division by zero. It is straightforward and uses simple arithmetic operations. No external data, environment variables, or potentially malicious constructs are involved. The code appears standard for such calculations and lacks any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility function for percentage calculation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
