  "purpose": "Calculate the percentage change between two values.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: current, previous.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the calculated percentage or zero.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in the calculation, resulting in a numeric output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward calculation with division by previous if non-zero.",
  "analysis": "The function takes two numerical inputs, current and previous. It performs a conditional check: if previous is non-zero, it computes the percentage change; otherwise, it returns zero to avoid division by zero. There are no external data reads, no untrusted data sources, and no malicious code behaviors present. The code appears to be a simple utility function for statistical or analytical purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for calculating percentage change. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
