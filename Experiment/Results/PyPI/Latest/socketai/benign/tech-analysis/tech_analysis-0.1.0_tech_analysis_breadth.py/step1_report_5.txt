{
  "purpose": "Perform financial data analysis using functions that calculate advance-decline metrics, ratios, highs and lows, and a trinar indicator.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: advancing, declining, unchanged, new_highs, new_lows; data is passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generate lists; no external data sinks or untrusted data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into computations; results are returned as new lists; no external communication or data leaks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Functions perform straightforward calculations without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains four functions for financial calculations: advance_decline, advance_decline_ratio, new_highs_lows, trinar_indicator. Each function performs simple arithmetic operations (subtraction, division, summation) on input lists. No use of external data sources, environment variables, or system calls. The calculations are typical for financial analysis. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate financial analysis functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is straightforward and lacks suspicious behaviors. Overall security risk is very low.",
