{
  "purpose": "Provides financial market indicators and calculations related to advance/decline data, such as trend lines, ratios, and indicators.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: advancing, declining, unchanged, new_highs, new_lows; data passed into functions from external modules or datasets.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing processed data; no untrusted data written to external systems or files; no network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (advancing, declining, etc.) flows into calculations; results are returned directly. No external data sinks or system commands are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The functions perform straightforward mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic financial calculations with standard Python syntax. Functions process input lists to generate indicators. No dynamic code execution, external resource access, or data exfiltration observed. The logic is transparent and typical for data analysis scripts. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security concerns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard financial calculations without malicious intent or security risks. It is purely computational and does not exhibit any suspicious patterns.",
