{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing financial market data such as advancing and declining stocks, new highs and lows, and trinary indicators, likely used for market trend analysis.",
  "sources": "Function inputs: 'advancing', 'declining', 'new_highs', 'new_lows', 'unchanged' - these are data arrays or lists passed as arguments, presumably from external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations on these inputs but does not directly output or transmit data; potential concerns would be if outputs are used in further data flows, but no network or file operations are present here.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, which process and return new lists or values. No external sinks (e.g., network, file) are directly involved in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The functions are straightforward mathematical operations; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or external data manipulations are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several financial analysis functions: 'advance_decline' accumulates net advances; 'advance_decline_ratio' computes ratios with division-by-zero safeguards; 'new_highs_lows' calculates differences; 'trinar_indicator' computes a normalized indicator with division-by-zero protection. All functions perform standard statistical calculations without any suspicious or malicious code patterns. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious data handling, or backdoors. The code appears benign and intended for analytical purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of financial market indicators with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware features. Overall, it appears to be a safe, purpose-specific module.",
