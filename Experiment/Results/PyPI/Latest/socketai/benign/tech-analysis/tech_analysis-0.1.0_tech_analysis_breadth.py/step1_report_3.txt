{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for technical analysis metrics related to advancing/declining issues, highs/lows, and indicator calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: 'advancing', 'declining', 'new_highs', 'new_lows', 'unchanged'. These are likely lists or sequences of numerical data.",
  "sinks": "Returns computed lists; no direct output sinks like file writes or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, which perform arithmetic calculations and return new lists; no external data flows or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior; the code performs straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four functions to perform simple financial calculations on input lists: 'advance_decline' accumulates differences, 'advance_decline_ratio' computes ratios with zero handling, 'new_highs_lows' computes differences, and 'trinar_indicator' calculates a ratio with zero division safety. All functions are pure, perform basic list processing, and contain no external calls, network access, or data leaks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalous code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for technical analysis calculations with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and intended for normal financial data processing.",
