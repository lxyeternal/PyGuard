{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for financial data analysis, including calculations for advance-decline lines, ratios, new highs/lows, and trinar indicators.",
  "sources": "The functions take input data arrays (advancing, declining, new_highs, new_lows, unchanged) which are expected to come from external data sources such as market data feeds or user input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions, as it only performs numerical calculations and returns results.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed through arithmetic operations and list comprehensions, resulting in output lists; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of system-critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward mathematical operations with proper checks for division by zero.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four functions that process input lists related to financial market indicators. Each function performs simple list comprehensions with arithmetic operations, including division with zero checks. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden functionality, or malicious logic. Usage of standard Python syntax and no external system calls suggest benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of financial indicator calculations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate analytical functions.",
