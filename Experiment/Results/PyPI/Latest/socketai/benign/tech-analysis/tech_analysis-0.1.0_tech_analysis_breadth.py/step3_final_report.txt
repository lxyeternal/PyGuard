{
  "purpose": "Provides basic financial indicator calculations such as advance-decline line, ratio, new highs/lows, and trinar indicator.",
  "sources": "Input lists: advancing, declining, unchanged, new_highs, new_lows",
  "sinks": "None; all calculations are in-memory and do not involve external data or system calls",
  "flows": "Input data flows directly into calculations; no external sinks or data leaks identified",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with proper zero-division safeguards and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, transparent numerical computations on input lists. No external interactions, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Zero-division checks are correctly implemented. The functions are standard for financial data analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The security assessment should reflect a very low malware likelihood and risk. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
