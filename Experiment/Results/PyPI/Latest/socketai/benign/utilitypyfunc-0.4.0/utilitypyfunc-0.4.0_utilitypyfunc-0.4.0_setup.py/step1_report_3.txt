  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package called 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "Input data from the setup() function arguments and the find_packages() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow beyond standard setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for packaging, calls setup() with metadata including package name, version, author info, description, classifiers, required Python version, and dependencies. The 'install_requires' specifies 'requests', a common library. No input from untrusted sources or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard Python package configuration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious activity.",
