  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package name, version, dependencies, author info, description, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the setup script does not execute or evaluate untrusted data; it merely defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and requirements with no dynamic execution or untrusted data handling. All elements are static strings and lists typical for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code insertion. The email address appears to be a personal email but does not pose a security risk. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
