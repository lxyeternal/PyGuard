  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for 'utilitypyfunc' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, dependency list, and package discovery via find_packages(). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data streams.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the script only executes static configuration commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to specify package metadata and dependencies. All inputs are static strings or function calls with no external input or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. It securely and transparently defines package metadata and dependencies.",
