  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup.py configuration for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, and author info are straightforward and static.\n- The description mentions \"a simple dimasik trolling library,\" which appears benign.\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code provided matches the description: a typical setup.py script.\n   - No suspicious code, malicious logic, or anomalies are detected.\n   - The package name, version, author, dependencies, and classifiers are standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code is straightforward and correctly structured.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, consistent with the clear, benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and malware justification:**\n   - Since the code is static, standard, and free of malicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - No reason to increase scores.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious features. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
