  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for packaging a Python library named 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() parameters; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard setup configuration with no unusual constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define a Python package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, email, description, classifiers, required Python version, and dependencies. All components are static and standard for a Python package setup script. No code executes dynamic input, network operations, or file manipulations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks detected. It merely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
