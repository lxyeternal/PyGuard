  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and author information from the setup function.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is static configuration data; no dynamic data flow from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, specifies package metadata, dependencies, author info, and classifiers. It appears to be a standard setup.py file for distributing a Python package. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic detected. The description mentions 'a simple dimasik trolling library,' which suggests a benign intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. All code appears typical for Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
