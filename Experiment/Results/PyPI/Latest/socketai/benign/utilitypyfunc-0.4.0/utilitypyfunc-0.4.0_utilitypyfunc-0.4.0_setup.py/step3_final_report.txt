  "purpose": "Static setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, author info, and classifiers within setup.py.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; the code is static and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static setup.py script importing setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The description mentions 'a simple dimasik trolling library,' which appears benign. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0, confidence 1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
