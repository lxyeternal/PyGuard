{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'utils' module, likely for utility functions, but provides no further context.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'utils'. No other input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is observable from the single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing a module without any usage, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for 'utils'. There are no functions, data handling, or other logic to evaluate. Importing a module alone does not indicate malicious behavior; it depends on how the module is used later, which is not shown here. The snippet provides no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal code provided, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import alone is harmless but offers no insight into the overall intent or security posture of the complete code.",
