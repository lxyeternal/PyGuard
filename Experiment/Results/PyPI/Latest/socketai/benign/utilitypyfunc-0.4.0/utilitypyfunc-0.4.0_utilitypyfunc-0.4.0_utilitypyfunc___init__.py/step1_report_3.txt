  "purpose": "Importing the utils module, likely for utility functions or code reuse within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import utils' indicates reading from the utils module, which may contain functions or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially unsafe data handling observed in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined from just the import statement; no execution or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement is minimal; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which alone does not imply malicious intent. Since no further code, input handling, or data processing is present, there are no observable security risks or malicious behavior. The utils module may contain code, but its contents are unknown and cannot be assessed from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign in this minimal form.",
