{
  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of a minimal Python import statement 'import utils' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement 'import utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there is no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable beyond the import statement itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior are observed in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with no additional code, data flow, or network activity. Given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The 'utils' module's content remains unknown, but the import alone is benign. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with this assessment. The cautious approach of the reports is appropriate, and no further suspicion can be derived without additional code or context.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the minimal import statement. No adjustments are necessary.",
