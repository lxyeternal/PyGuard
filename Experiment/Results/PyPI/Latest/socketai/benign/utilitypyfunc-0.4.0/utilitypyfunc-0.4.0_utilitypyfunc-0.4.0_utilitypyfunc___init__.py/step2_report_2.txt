  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement of 'utils' with no additional code.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies are identified beyond the minimal import.\n- The reports consistently conclude that there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet.\n- Confidence levels vary from 0.3 to 0.8, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of context.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no suspicion of malicious intent based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains an import statement. No other code or behavior is shown.\n- **Malicious behavior:** Since the code is only an import statement, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The 'utils' module could be benign or malicious, but from this snippet alone, no conclusion can be drawn.\n- **Potential flaws in reasoning:**\n  - The reports are cautious and consistent, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n  - They do not assume malicious intent solely based on the import, which is correct.\n  - The reasoning that no suspicious activity is evident is sound.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Since the code is minimal, the confidence scores could be slightly adjusted upward, especially for reports with 0.3 or 0.4, to reflect the certainty that, with more context, the code could be benign or potentially malicious.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, but if this import is from an untrusted source, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified, though the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based solely on this minimal snippet,** I agree with the reports' conclusions that there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The 'utils' module's nature remains unknown, but the import itself is standard.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, unless additional context suggests otherwise)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are consistent and reasonable given the minimal code snippet. No changes are necessary unless further code or context is provided.",
