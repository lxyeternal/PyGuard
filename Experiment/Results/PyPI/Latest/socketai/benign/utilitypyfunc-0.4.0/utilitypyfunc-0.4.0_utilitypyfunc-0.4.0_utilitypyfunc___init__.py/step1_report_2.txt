  "purpose": "Importing a module named utils, likely for utility functions or support code within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads the utils module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing observed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident in this single line.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of an import statement for a module named utils. Since there is no further code or data handling, there are no apparent sources, sinks, or data flows. The utils module could be benign or malicious, but from this fragment alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The import is standard in Python and does not inherently suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple import statement with no suspicious activity detected.",
