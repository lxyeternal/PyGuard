{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'utils', which is likely intended to provide utility functions or helpers for the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'utils' module; no other data sources or inputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present; the code does not process or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from a simple import statement; no source-to-sink flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with no additional logic or context. The 'utils' module could be benign or malicious, but from this fragment alone, there's no suspicious behavior or unusual code activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'utils' with no other instructions or logic. Without additional context, this import is standard in Python projects. Since no functions, data processing, or network activity are shown, there's no apparent malicious behavior. The lack of further code prevents any detailed flow or anomaly detection. Therefore, the analysis relies solely on this minimal snippet, which appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The import statement is standard and does not, by itself, present any security concern.",
