{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for RDF serialization annotations, allowing customization of RDF predicates and data types for model fields.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code reads class attributes and annotations via the 'field' parameter in extract methods.",
  "sinks": "The extract methods read metadata from fields; however, they do not write or execute untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only inspects metadata within class fields.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, defining annotation classes and extraction methods. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two data classes, WithPredicate and WithDataType, for RDF field annotations. Each class contains a method to extract relevant URI references from field metadata. The code relies on standard Python features, type annotations, and RDFlib constructs. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It primarily serves as a utility for RDF serialization customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for RDF annotation purposes. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
