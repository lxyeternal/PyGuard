  "purpose": "Defines annotation classes for customizing RDF predicate and datatype serialization in Python data models.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, rdflib, and type annotations; class attributes; class methods extracting metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions and class methods extract metadata from fields; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and primarily metadata handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dataclasses with class methods to extract RDF-related metadata annotations from model fields. No data input, external communication, or executable logic that could be malicious is present. The purpose is to facilitate RDF serialization customization. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for RDF serialization customization with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
