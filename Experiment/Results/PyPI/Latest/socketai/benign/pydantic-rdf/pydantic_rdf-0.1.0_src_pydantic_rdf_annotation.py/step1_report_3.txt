  "purpose": "Define annotations for specifying custom RDF predicates and datatypes for model fields in RDF serialization.",
  "sources": "None (the code defines classes and methods; it does not read external input or data).",
  "sinks": "None (the code does not process untrusted data, write to external systems, or perform network operations).",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, WithPredicate and WithDataType, each containing an extract method to retrieve metadata from field annotations. The classes are purely for static annotation purposes and do not include input/output operations or dynamic code execution. There are no embedded network calls, file operations, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure appears straightforward, and the annotations are standard for defining RDF serialization preferences. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data classes for RDF field annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as metadata helpers within RDF serialization workflows.",
