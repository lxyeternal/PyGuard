{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes to annotate RDF predicates and data types for serializing model fields in RDF format.",
  "sources": "Field annotations and metadata within the data classes and their extract methods.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is sent or written to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Annotations are extracted from field metadata for serialization purposes; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines two data classes, WithPredicate and WithDataType, for use as annotations to specify RDF serialization details. Both classes include an extract method to retrieve metadata from field annotations. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The import of rdflib.URIRef is standard for RDF data modeling. No external calls or system modifications are present. Overall, the code's structure and content are typical for a serialization annotation system, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of data annotation classes for RDF serialization, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious activity.",
