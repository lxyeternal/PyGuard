  "purpose": "Define annotations for customizing RDF serialization of model fields, specifically for RDF predicates and data types.",
  "sources": "Class attributes 'predicate' and 'data_type'; class methods 'extract'; uses 'getattr' to access 'metadata' on fields.",
  "sinks": "Return of 'predicate' and 'data_type' values; no external data sinks or network communication; no direct data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Extraction of annotation metadata from fields to determine RDF predicates and data types; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes 'WithPredicate' and 'WithDataType' used as annotations for RDF serialization customization. The 'extract' class methods retrieve annotation data from field metadata. The implementation relies on standard Python practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a benign utility for metadata annotation in RDF models.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as metadata annotation helpers for RDF serialization. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is detected.",
