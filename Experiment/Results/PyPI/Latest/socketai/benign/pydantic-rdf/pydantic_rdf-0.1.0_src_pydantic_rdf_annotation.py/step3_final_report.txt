{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes used as annotations to specify custom RDF predicates and data types for model fields during RDF serialization, facilitating flexible and explicit RDF mapping.",
  "sources": "The extract methods read the 'metadata' attribute from the 'field' object, which contains annotation metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations; the code only retrieves metadata without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The extract methods iterate over 'field.metadata' to find instances of annotation classes and return associated URIs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, 'WithPredicate' and 'WithDataType', each serving as annotations for RDF serialization. Their 'extract' methods retrieve specific metadata from the 'field' annotations. The implementation uses standard Python practices and 'rdflib.URIRef'. There are no external data flows, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is static metadata annotation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility annotations for RDF serialization. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
