  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is purely definitional, with no execution, data processing, or network activity.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and the security risk is also 0.\n- Confidence is perfect (1) across all reports.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code contains only class definitions for exceptions; no functional or malicious code.\n   - No evidence of code that reads, writes, or processes untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Security risk: 0, also appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, accurate given the straightforward code.\n   - Given the nature of the code, these scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No such scores are assigned; the code is non-executable, non-networked, and only defines exceptions.\n   - No reason to elevate risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Exception classes are standard and safe.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only analyze the code as-is.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted security concerns.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - All scores are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The reports correctly assess the code as non-malicious with no security risks.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, and the unanimous expert assessments, I agree with the current scores. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
