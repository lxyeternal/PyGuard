  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for error handling in RDF parsing processes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; code contains only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. Exception classes are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors: CircularReferenceError and UnsupportedFieldTypeError. Both classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class, with constructors that format error messages involving provided parameters. There is no code execution, data processing, or external communication; the code purely defines error types. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling during RDF parsing. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is standard, safe, and clear.",
