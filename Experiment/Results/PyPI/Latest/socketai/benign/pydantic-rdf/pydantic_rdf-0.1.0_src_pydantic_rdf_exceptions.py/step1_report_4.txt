{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors during RDF parsing, specifically for circular references and unsupported field types.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources are read; the code defines classes and does not process runtime input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as there is no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with clear intent. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single class from a library and defines two exception classes with descriptive messages. There are no data processing, input handling, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be part of a larger RDF parsing system but on its own is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
