  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors, specifically for circular references and unsupported field types.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions without any suspicious or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'URIRef' from rdflib and defines two custom exception classes with detailed messages. Both classes are straightforward and serve to signal specific RDF parsing errors. No input handling, data processing, network communication, or other behavior that could be malicious is present. The exception classes are typical for error handling in RDF parsing contexts and do not contain any suspicious constructs or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for RDF parsing error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears purely functional and safe.",
