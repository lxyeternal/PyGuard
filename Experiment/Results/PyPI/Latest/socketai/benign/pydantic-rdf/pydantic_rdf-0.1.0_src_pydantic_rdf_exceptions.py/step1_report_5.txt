  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors related to circular references and unsupported field types.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported URIRef from the rdflib library, and the parameters passed to the exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input from URIRef or exception parameters flows into exception messages, but no untrusted data is used in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class (URIRef) and defines two custom exception classes with initialization methods that generate messages. No data is read from external sources, and no untrusted data is processed in a manner that could lead to security issues. The exception messages incorporate parameters but do not include user input directly, reducing risk. The code appears to serve as part of a larger RDF parsing framework but contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines exception classes for RDF parsing errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is standard and safe.",
