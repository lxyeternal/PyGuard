{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors, specifically handling circular references and unsupported field types.",
  "sources": "The class constructor parameters and exception raising code, which receive data at runtime (URIRef object, field_type, field_name).",
  "sinks": "Exception messages generated and potentially logged or displayed; no other data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to exception constructors create messages, which are then passed to super().__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code performs straightforward exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library, defines two custom exception classes, and constructs error messages with input parameters. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Exception handling appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for RDF parsing errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
