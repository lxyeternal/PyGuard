{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors, specifically handling circular references and unsupported field types.",
  "sources": "Class constructors receiving parameters such as URIRef, field_type, and field_name; constructing error messages.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; exception messages are constructed from parameters but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs to exception constructors leading to message creation; no data flow beyond class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard class definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two exception class definitions with constructors that generate messages based on parameters. It imports URIRef but does not process or handle data beyond class initialization. No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code is standard, safe, and serves as error signaling within an RDF parsing context. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, definitional nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
