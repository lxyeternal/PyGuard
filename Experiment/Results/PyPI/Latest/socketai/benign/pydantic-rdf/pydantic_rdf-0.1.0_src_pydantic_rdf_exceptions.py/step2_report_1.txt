  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of two custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors.\n- No data input/output, network communication, or dynamic execution is present.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware and obfuscation, and zero or very low for security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None are identified; the code is correct and conventional.\n- **Scores review:** The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only defines exception classes without any external data handling or execution, a high risk score isn't justified.\n- **Malware considerations:** No malicious activity is suggested; the malware score of 0 is correct.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** No assumptions lead to vulnerabilities; the code is purely definitional.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the report accurately reflects the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.",
