  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is minimal, defining two custom exception classes.\n- It imports `URIRef` from `rdflib`, but does not process any data.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with messages constructed from parameters.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct, idiomatic, and typical for such exception classes.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk, and the code does not perform any risky operations. Therefore, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  No malicious activity is evident. The code does not execute any code beyond class definitions, nor does it handle untrusted data in a harmful way.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  All reports correctly avoid basing concerns on unfounded assumptions. The code's simplicity and clarity support this.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  The code is purely defining exception classes; no malicious code exists.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0  \n  No security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for RDF parsing errors. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent in their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
