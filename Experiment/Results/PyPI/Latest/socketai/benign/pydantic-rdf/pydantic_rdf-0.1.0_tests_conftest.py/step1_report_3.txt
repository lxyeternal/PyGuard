  "purpose": "Setup fixtures for testing RDF graph operations using rdflib and pytest",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are used in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that could leak data or be exploited",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines fixtures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest fixtures to create an RDF Graph object and a Namespace. These are standard testing utilities for RDF data manipulation. There are no external inputs, network calls, or potentially malicious constructs present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup for testing RDF graph operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
