  "purpose": "Set up fixtures for testing RDF graph manipulations using rdflib and pytest",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only initializes objects and fixtures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variables, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest fixtures: one creates an RDF Graph object with a namespace binding; the other provides a namespace object. All operations are standard library usage for testing setup, with no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no external data sources, network activities, or sensitive information handling. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for testing RDF data using pytest and rdflib. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
