  "purpose": "Setup fixtures for testing RDF graphs using pytest and rdflib",
  "sources": "Input parameters EX in the graph fixture, which provides a Namespace object",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "EX fixture supplies Namespace to the graph fixture, no data flows to untrusted sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest fixtures: one for creating an RDF graph and another for providing a Namespace object. The Namespace is hardcoded with a generic URL ('http://example.com/'), which is standard for testing. No data is read from external or untrusted sources, and no sensitive data is handled. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The rdflib library is used normally for RDF data management. The structure and content are typical for test setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. It simply prepares objects for testing purposes.",
