  "purpose": "Setup pytest fixtures for RDF graph testing using rdflib.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it creates objects internally.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into any sink; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; only object creation and binding occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two fixtures: one returning a Namespace with a fixed URL, and another creating an RDF Graph, binding the 'ex' prefix to the namespace. It uses standard libraries (pytest, rdflib) without external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a typical test setup, benign and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate benign behavior, and scores are appropriately zero.",
