  "purpose": "Demonstrates defining, serializing, and deserializing RDF models using pydantic-rdf and Schema.org types.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters and hardcoded strings in model instances.",
  "sinks": "Serialization output to RDF graph (Turtle format) and console print statements.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from instance creation to serialization; deserialized back into model instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and models.",
  "analysis": "The code creates data models for RDF serialization/deserialization using pydantic-rdf and Schema.org. It serializes model instances into RDF graphs and then deserializes them back, with no user input or untrusted data sources involved. No external network connections, system modifications, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The code follows typical usage patterns for RDF modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of RDF modeling with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles data serialization/deserialization without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
