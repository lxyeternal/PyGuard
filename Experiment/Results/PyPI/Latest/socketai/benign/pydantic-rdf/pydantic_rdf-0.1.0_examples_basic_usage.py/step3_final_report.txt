  "purpose": "Demonstrates RDF modeling and serialization/deserialization using pydantic-rdf with Schema.org types.",
  "sources": "Input data from hardcoded values in class instantiations (e.g., name, email, address fields).",
  "sinks": "Serialization to RDF graph, deserialization back to model instances.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation (sources) through model_dump_rdf() (serialization) and parse_graph() (deserialization).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of data modeling with pydantic-rdf, involving defining models, serializing to RDF, and deserializing back. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code uses default values and static data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational demonstration of RDF modeling with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The low security risk score (0.1) in some reports is acceptable but could be standardized to 0, as no real vulnerabilities exist.",
