  "purpose": "Demonstrates the creation, serialization, and deserialization of RDF data models using Pydantic and Schema.org types.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded strings for person name, email, job title, and address fields; RDF graph data during serialization and deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Serialization output as RDF/Turtle format; data passed to RDF graph methods; deserialization from RDF graphs.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded data flows into RDF models; models serialize to RDF graphs; RDF graphs are parsed back into models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of standard libraries (pydantic, rdflib) for RDF handling is typical. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or system manipulation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with RDF mapping and handles serialization/deserialization using pydantic_rdf and rdflib. Data is statically defined via hardcoded strings, which is typical for example scripts. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling present. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of RDF data modeling and processing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is an example of RDF modeling with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manipulates data within the scope of RDF serialization/deserialization using open-source libraries, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected.",
