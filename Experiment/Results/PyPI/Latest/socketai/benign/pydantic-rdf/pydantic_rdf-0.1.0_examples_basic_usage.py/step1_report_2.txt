  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of pydantic-rdf library with Schema.org types for defining models, serializing to RDF, and deserializing from RDF.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic, rdflib, and pydantic_rdf; usage of SDO namespace; reading of model attributes (name, email, jobTitle, address, knowsAbout); default values for addressCountry.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of RDF graph to Turtle format; parsing RDF graph back into model instances.",
  "flows": "Input data (model attributes) flow into model instances; model serialization outputs RDF graph; RDF graph input used for parsing back into models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; default value for addressCountry is benign; no evidence of code injection or obfuscation; straightforward use of library features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with RDF mapping, creates instances with provided data, serializes these instances into RDF graphs, and then deserializes RDF graphs back into model instances. It uses standard library functions and features with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are observed. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or malicious code. It functions solely as a demonstration of the pydantic-rdf library capabilities, with no signs of hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating schema mapping, RDF serialization, and deserialization using pydantic-rdf and Schema.org types. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
