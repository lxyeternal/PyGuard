  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational demonstration of RDF modeling with no malicious intent or security risks. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The low security risk score (0.1) in some reports is acceptable but could be standardized to 0, as no real vulnerabilities exist."
