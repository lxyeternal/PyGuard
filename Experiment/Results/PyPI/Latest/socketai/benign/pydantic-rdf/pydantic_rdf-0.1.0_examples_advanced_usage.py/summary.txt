  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, illustrative example with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from the general concern of RDF parsing untrusted data, which is not applicable in this controlled example. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect this theoretical concern."
