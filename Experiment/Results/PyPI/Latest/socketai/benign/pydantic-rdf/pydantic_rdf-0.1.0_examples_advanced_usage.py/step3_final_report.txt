  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of pydantic-rdf features including validation, computed fields, circular references, and RDF serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Internal class fields, hardcoded data within main(), no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "RDF graph serialization/deserialization, no external network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model input to RDF serialization and back via parsing; no external untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; circular references are explicitly handled; no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of pydantic-rdf capabilities, including validation, inheritance, circular references, and RDF serialization. It uses internal, hardcoded data, with no external data sources or network activity. Circular references are handled properly with 'Self' annotations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The RDF parsing occurs on internal data, with no indication of untrusted input. The code structure is clear and well-organized, with no obfuscation. Potential minor security considerations relate to RDF parsing of untrusted data or circular references, but these are not exploited here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, illustrative example with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from the general concern of RDF parsing untrusted data, which is not applicable in this controlled example. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect this theoretical concern.",
