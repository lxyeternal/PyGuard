{
  "purpose": "This code provides a library interface for bridging Pydantic V2 models with RDF graphs, enabling serialization and validation for semantic web data.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from 'pydantic_rdf.annotation' and 'pydantic_rdf.model'. It also defines an example usage within a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data outputs or external connections are shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining model classes, and setting class attributes for RDF serialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward library code with no hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or obfuscated elements. The example is typical for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules for RDF and Pydantic integration, defines a simple model class with RDF namespace and properties, and exposes these via __all__. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected. The example code within the docstring is standard for documentation and does not execute any dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library interface for data modeling with RDF and Pydantic. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use.",
