{
  "purpose": "This source code provides a library interface for bridging Pydantic V2 models with RDF graphs, facilitating serialization and deserialization of data models for semantic web applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pydantic_rdf.annotation' and 'pydantic_rdf.model', as well as the inline example code defining a namespace and a model.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or system calls, data output, or sensitive data handling identified.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines classes; the example code shows a potential source-to-sink flow of defining data models but does not process untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The example uses standard Python constructs and typical library usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes for RDF and Pydantic model integration. The included example demonstrates typical usage without executing or handling untrusted data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. The imports are from a known library structure, and the code serves a standard purpose for data modeling. No network or file system operations are present that could be exploited. Overall, this appears to be clean, intended library code with no malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign library module with an example usage; no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are detected. It solely defines data models and imports necessary components for a semantic web integration library.",
