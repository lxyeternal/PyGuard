  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily import statements, documentation, and a straightforward example. There are no indications of code execution, dynamic behavior, or data handling that could be malicious.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data directly.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports uniformly note that the code is standard, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident; the code is a typical library interface with clear purpose and no hidden behaviors.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, well-structured, and intended for library purposes only.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score here is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - No justification exists for elevating the risk score since there's no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or dangerous behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus on the static analysis of the code, which is safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the findings: no malicious or obfuscated code, no security risks, and high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward library interface with an example usage, containing no dynamic, network, or data-processing behavior that could be malicious or risky. The consistent reports and analysis support this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, well-documented, and serves a standard purpose in a library. No security concerns are evident, and the scores assigned are appropriate.",
