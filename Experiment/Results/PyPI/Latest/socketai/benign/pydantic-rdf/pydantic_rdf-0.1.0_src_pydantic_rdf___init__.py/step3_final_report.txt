{
  "purpose": "This module provides a static interface for bridging Pydantic V2 models with RDF graphs, including documentation and example usage.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and documentation within the module; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static library interface with a descriptive docstring and import statements. It contains no functions, data processing, or network activity. The imports are from a known package structure, and the code serves as documentation and setup for library components. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its safety. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
