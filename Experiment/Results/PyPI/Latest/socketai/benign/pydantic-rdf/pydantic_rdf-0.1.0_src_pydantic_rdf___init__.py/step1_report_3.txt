{
  "purpose": "To provide a bridge between Pydantic V2 models and RDF graphs, enabling serialization and validation of semantic web data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pydantic_rdf.annotation' and 'pydantic_rdf.model', and the module's __all__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no execution of untrusted data, network activity, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and functions that are intended for use in defining models; no data flow or untrusted input processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code consists of standard imports and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module-level documentation, import statements, and an explicit export list. It imports classes meant for model definition and annotations related to RDF and Pydantic integration. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution that could introduce security issues. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this static code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining imports and documentation for a library that integrates Pydantic models with RDF graphs. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for a library interface.",
