{
  "purpose": "Provide a description and example of a library that bridges Pydantic models with RDF graphs for semantic web data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic_rdf.annotation and pydantic_rdf.model, as well as the module's docstring",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is being processed, stored, or transmitted within this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a docstring explaining the library's purpose and usage, along with straightforward imports and exports. There are no runtime behaviors, user input handling, or external data processing. No functions or executable code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The imported modules are part of the intended library functions, and no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module defining and exporting classes related to RDF and Pydantic integration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
