  "purpose": "The code provides a documentation string and imports for a library that bridges Pydantic models with RDF graphs, enabling serialization and validation for semantic web applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic_rdf.annotation and pydantic_rdf.model modules.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks are present in the provided code; it mainly defines module exports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or outputs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be standard library setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a descriptive docstring explaining the purpose of the library and example usage, followed by imports and an export list. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or network operations are present. The code is typical for a Python package's interface and documentation; no malicious patterns or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a Python library module, primarily containing documentation, imports, and exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
