  "purpose": "Define protocols for namespace handling and a NamedTuple for type information in RDF processing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; imports from standard library and rdflib.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be straightforward interface and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Protocol classes for namespace access patterns and a NamedTuple for type information. There are no functions executing external commands, network access, or handling untrusted data. The imported modules are standard and rdflib, which is commonly used for RDF data manipulation. No malicious intent or obfuscation is evident. The code is clean, simple, and serves as type hints or interface definitions without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural part of an RDF handling library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
