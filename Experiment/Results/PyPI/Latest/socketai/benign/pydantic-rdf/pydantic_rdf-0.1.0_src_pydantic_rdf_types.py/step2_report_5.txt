  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues found.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the code as purely structural, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All scores are zero or one, reflecting benign nature. The malware score is zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, defining protocols and a NamedTuple for type info. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is consistent with the description; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis correctly states the code is standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware is zero; appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code only defines interfaces and data structures, with no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code matches description.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware is zero; appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is simple interface and data structure definitions, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code matches description.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware is zero; appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard type hints and protocols, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code matches description.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware is zero; appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely declarative, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reasoning is sound, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the code and reports, I agree with the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-understood pattern for defining interfaces and data structures in Python, especially for type hinting and protocol enforcement in RDF namespace handling contexts.",
