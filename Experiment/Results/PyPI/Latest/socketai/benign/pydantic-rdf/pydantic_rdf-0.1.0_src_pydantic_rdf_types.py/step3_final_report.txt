  "purpose": "Define interface protocols for namespace handling and a data structure for type information in RDF contexts.",
  "sources": "No external data input; code defines class interfaces and a NamedTuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python Protocol classes with __getitem__ methods returning URIRef, and a simple NamedTuple for type info. It is purely declarative, used for type checking and interface enforcement. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of interface protocols and data structures for RDF namespace handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
