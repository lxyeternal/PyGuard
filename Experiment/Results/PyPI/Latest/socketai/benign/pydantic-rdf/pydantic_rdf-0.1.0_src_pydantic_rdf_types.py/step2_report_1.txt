  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely structural, defining protocols and data structures for namespace handling and type info.\n- No external data input/output, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- The imports (typing, rdflib) are standard for RDF and type hinting.\n- The Protocol classes specify expected interface methods, which is typical for flexible API design.\n- The NamedTuple is a simple data container with no behavior.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any signs of malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it. Since there's no security risk or malicious intent, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent; no claims of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior are justified.\n- The code is intended for type checking and interface enforcement, which is common and safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign part of a larger RDF namespace handling system.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the reports' assessments: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and consensus in the reports.",
