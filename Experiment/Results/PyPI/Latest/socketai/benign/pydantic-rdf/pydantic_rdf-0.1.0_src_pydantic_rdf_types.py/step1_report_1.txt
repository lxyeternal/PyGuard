  "purpose": "Define protocol interfaces for namespace handling and a data structure for type information.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading; the code only defines classes and protocols.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Protocol classes with __getitem__ methods, indicating expected interface behaviors for namespace objects, and a NamedTuple for type metadata. All methods are type-annotated, and the structure appears to be for type hinting and interface enforcement. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and purely structural, used for type checking and design enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Python interface and data structure definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system for namespace management and type annotation.",
