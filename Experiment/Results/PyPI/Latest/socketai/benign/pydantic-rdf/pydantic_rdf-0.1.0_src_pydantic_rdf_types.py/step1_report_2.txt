{
  "purpose": "Defines protocols and a named tuple for type information, likely for use in RDF/semantic web contexts.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports modules and defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code consists solely of type/interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hinting modules and rdflib for RDF handling. It defines two Protocols to specify interfaces for namespace objects, with __getitem__ methods that return URIRef instances. The TypeInfo NamedTuple records metadata about data types. There are no data processing, input/output, or external communications. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be standard type interface declarations with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type interfaces and data structures for RDF namespace handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
