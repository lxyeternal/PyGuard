{
  "purpose": "Define protocols and a data structure for type information related to RDF namespaces and fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'rdflib'; class definitions including methods with type hints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, input, or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares protocols and a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Protocols are standard Python typing constructs. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type hints, protocols, and a NamedTuple for type info. Protocols specify expected method signatures for namespace objects, which is typical for flexible interface definitions. The NamedTuple 'TypeInfo' encapsulates metadata about fields. No input/output handling, no external data manipulation, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be purely declarative and standard for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks. It is a straightforward set of type definitions and interface protocols used for type checking or API design.",
