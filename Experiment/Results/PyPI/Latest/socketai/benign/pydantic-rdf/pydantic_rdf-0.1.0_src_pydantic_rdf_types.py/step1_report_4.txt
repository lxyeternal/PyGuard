{
  "purpose": "Define protocol interfaces for namespace handling and a data structure for type information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of type hints and protocols appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two protocol classes, IsPrefixNamespace and IsDefinedNamespace, which specify method signatures for namespace access patterns, and a NamedTuple class TypeInfo for holding type metadata. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward type/interface definition module with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining data structures and protocols without any malicious or risky behavior. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
