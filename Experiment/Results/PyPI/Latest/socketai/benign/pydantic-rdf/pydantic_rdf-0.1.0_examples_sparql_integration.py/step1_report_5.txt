{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates RDF data loading, SPARQL querying, and mapping results to Pydantic models for RDF data.",
  "sources": "Graph creation and population with RDF triples; SPARQL query strings",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; data is only used internally for RDF graph querying and model creation",
  "flows": "Graph data is queried via SPARQL; results are processed and mapped into Pydantic models",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script builds a local RDF graph with sample data, then runs predefined SPARQL queries to retrieve data about persons and books. The SPARQL queries are static string literals and do not include user input. The results are processed to instantiate models without involving external untrusted input. No network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration code is present. The code uses standard RDF and Pydantic libraries, with clear intent for RDF data handling and modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward RDF data processing example, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as an RDF data query and modeling example without external or untrusted data sources. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
