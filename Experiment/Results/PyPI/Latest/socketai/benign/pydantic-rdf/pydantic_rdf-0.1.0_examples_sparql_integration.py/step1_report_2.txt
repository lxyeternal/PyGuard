  "purpose": "Demonstrates loading RDF data, executing SPARQL queries, and converting results to Pydantic models using rdflib and pydantic-rdf.",
  "sources": "Reading RDF triples from the in-memory Graph object; executing SPARQL queries on the graph.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Data is added to the RDF graph from hardcoded triples, then queried with SPARQL, and results are mapped to Pydantic models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Usage of standard libraries for RDF handling and data modeling; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script creates an RDF graph, populates it with sample data, and performs SPARQL queries to retrieve data about persons and books. The data is processed into Pydantic models without any untrusted input or external data sources. The code uses standard libraries and functions with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no network operations, system modifications, or external command executions. The code appears to be a straightforward RDF data processing example.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating RDF data handling and SPARQL querying with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
