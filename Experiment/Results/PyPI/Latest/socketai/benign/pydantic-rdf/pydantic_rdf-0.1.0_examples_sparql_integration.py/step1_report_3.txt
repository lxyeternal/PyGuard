  "purpose": "Demonstrates RDF data loading, SPARQL querying, and conversion to Pydantic models using rdflib and pydantic-rdf.",
  "sources": "Graph data populated within the script (triples added via g.add). External RDF/SPARQL data sources are not used.",
  "sinks": "Results from SPARQL queries, especially the conversion functions (Person.from_sparql_result, parse_graph). No direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Graph data creation -> SPARQL query execution -> Query results processed by from_sparql_result or parse_graph methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an RDF graph with sample data, executes SPARQL queries to retrieve persons and books, then converts query results into Pydantic models. No external data fetching, no user input handling, and no data leaks or network activity. The functions used are standard for RDF handling and data modeling, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, and there are no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign demonstration of RDF and SPARQL functionalities using standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious payloads. The usage aligns with typical data processing and modeling tasks.",
