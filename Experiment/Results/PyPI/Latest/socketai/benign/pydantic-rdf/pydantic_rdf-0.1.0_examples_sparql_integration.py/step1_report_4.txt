{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates loading RDF data, running SPARQL queries, and converting results into Pydantic RDF models.",
  "sources": "Graph data initialized within the script; SPARQL query strings defined in code.",
  "sinks": "Results processed into models, printed to console; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "RDF graph data is queried via SPARQL, then results flow into model creation functions and are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code structures or obfuscated code; no external network activity; the code is straightforward and educational.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an RDF graph with sample data, performs SPARQL queries to retrieve data about people and books, and converts query results into Pydantic RDF models. The data is contained locally within the script, with no external input or output channels other than printing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code uses standard libraries, has clear and legitimate logic, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a benign example for RDF and SPARQL integration, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example script for RDF data handling with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely performs local data processing and printing, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
