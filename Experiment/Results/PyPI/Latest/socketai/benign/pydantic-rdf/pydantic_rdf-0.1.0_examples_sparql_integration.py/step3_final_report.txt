  "purpose": "A static example demonstrating RDF data loading, SPARQL querying, and mapping results into Pydantic models without external inputs or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded RDF triples within the in-memory graph.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static RDF data loaded into graph -> SPARQL query results -> Pydantic model instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a static RDF graph with predefined data about persons and books, performs SPARQL queries to retrieve this data, and maps results into Pydantic models. It does not accept external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code uses standard libraries and simple data structures. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The slight security risk scores of 0.1 are conservative and can be considered overestimations given the controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static demonstration of RDF and SPARQL with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and overall security risk 0. The existing assessments are accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
