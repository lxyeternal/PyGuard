  "purpose": "Base class for RDF-mappable Pydantic models supporting serialization and deserialization of RDF data, including nested models and circular reference handling.",
  "sources": "Reads RDF graph objects via predicates, extracting values for model fields based on RDF predicates and annotations.",
  "sinks": "Constructs RDF graphs from model instances, adding triples for each field, including nested models and lists.",
  "flows": "Graph objects are read from RDF triples (sources) and converted into model fields; model fields are serialized back into RDF triples (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; cache used for circular reference detection is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard RDF serialization/deserialization with proper type handling, nested models, and circular reference prevention. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Cache management and exception handling are appropriate. The code operates solely on data parsing and serialization, with no external communication or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard RDF data handling utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
