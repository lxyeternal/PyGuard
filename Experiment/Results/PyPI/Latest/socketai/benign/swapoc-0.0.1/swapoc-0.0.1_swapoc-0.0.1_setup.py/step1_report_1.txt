{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'swapoc' including package metadata and description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README' file for long description, and uses setuptools.find_packages() to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reads long description from file, then passes package metadata to setuptools.setup() to package the code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a non-standard filename 'README' instead of 'README.md' or 'README.txt'; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads a README file and configures package metadata. No code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The use of 'setuptools' and 'find_packages' is typical for packaging purposes. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares a package for distribution.",
