  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No malicious or obfuscated code present. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data insecurely. All code appears to be standard packaging boilerplate for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in this snippet.",
