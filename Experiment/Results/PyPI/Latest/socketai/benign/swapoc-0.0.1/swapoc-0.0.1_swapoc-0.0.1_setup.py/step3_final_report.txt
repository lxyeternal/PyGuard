{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'swapoc' Python project, configuring package metadata and reading a 'README' file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README' file; uses 'setuptools.find_packages()' to locate packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README' -> passes metadata to 'setuptools.setup()' without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a filename 'README' without an extension, which is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, boilerplate 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The only minor anomaly is the filename 'README' instead of a typical 'README.md' or 'README.txt', which does not pose security risks. All security signals—malware, obfuscation, and risks—are absent, with scores of 0. The code's structure and behavior are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign packaging script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
