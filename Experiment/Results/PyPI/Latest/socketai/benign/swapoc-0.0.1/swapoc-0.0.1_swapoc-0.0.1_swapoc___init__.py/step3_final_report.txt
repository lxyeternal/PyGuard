  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, file I/O, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded data.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, system command execution, potential data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, user input) potentially flow into dynamic execution or network communication points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded URLs, complex control flow, incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system damage are confirmed. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and potential network activity. The scores are consistent with these observations: malware at 0.6, obfuscation at 0.7, and risk at 0.7, reflecting moderate suspicion. For code lacking clarity or completeness, low scores are appropriate. The scores for other reports align with their minimal or benign content. Overall, the scores are justified by the described behaviors, with no significant over- or underestimation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code features but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Further static or dynamic testing is recommended to confirm or refute these suspicions.",
