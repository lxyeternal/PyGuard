  "purpose": "Generate a random password by shuffling a character set and selecting characters.",
  "sources": "Reading the character set string, shuffling the list with random.shuffle(), and popping characters in a loop.",
  "sinks": "The password string being returned and printed; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Character set -> shuffle -> pop characters -> assemble password -> return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.shuffle() for password generation, which is not cryptographically secure; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a password by shuffling a predefined character list and popping characters to form the password. It uses random.shuffle(), which is predictable and not suitable for cryptographic purposes, representing a security concern but not malicious activity. No external data, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling is standard. The code is straightforward and benign. The primary security issue is the use of non-cryptographically secure randomness, which could be exploited in security-sensitive contexts, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple password generator with no malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The main concern is the use of insecure randomness, which is a security best practice issue rather than malicious code. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minor security concern without malicious intent.",
