  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for extracting and formatting hierarchical categories from an Excel file. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The external dependency is typical and does not introduce risk. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
