{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for translating text between Tibetan, English, and Tibetan, utilizing an API key for an anthropic client to interact with the Claude model.",
  "sources": "The code reads the API key from the environment variable 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'. It also takes input text for translation functions.",
  "sinks": "The API key is used directly in API client initialization, which is standard. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "API key is read from environment and used to authenticate API requests. Text input flows from function parameters into API requests. Responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with proper API key handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows. No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs translation functions via an external API. It securely retrieves API keys from environment variables and uses them only for client initialization. No data is written to or read from insecure locations beyond standard environment variable access. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The structure is typical for API interaction and translation processing, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focused on translation tasks with secure handling of API keys. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
