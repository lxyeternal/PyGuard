  "purpose": "Download a Google Sheets spreadsheet as an XLSX file using urllib3 and save it to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The URL for the Google Sheets export link, the response data from urllib3 request.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a temporary file on disk.",
  "flows": "Request to URL -> receive response -> read data -> write data to temp file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL domains beyond Google Sheets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for temporary files and HTTP requests. It constructs a Google Sheets export URL with a fixed spreadsheet ID. The 'download_spreedsheet' function initializes an HTTP connection, performs a GET request to download the spreadsheet content, and writes the data in chunks to a temporary file. The response connection is released properly, and the temporary filename is returned. The code performs a standard download operation without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved beyond the fixed URL, and no dangerous operations like code execution or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely downloads a spreadsheet file from a fixed URL and saves it temporarily. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility function with no indicators of supply chain or malware concerns.",
