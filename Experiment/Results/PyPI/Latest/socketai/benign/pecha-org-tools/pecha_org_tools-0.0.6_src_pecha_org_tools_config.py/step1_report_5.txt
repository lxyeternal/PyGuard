  "sinks": "urllib3 request to download data, temporary file to save downloaded data",
  "flows": "Function input (spreedsheet_link) -> HTTP GET request -> data read in chunks -> write to temporary file",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious domains, or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to download a specific Google Sheets spreadsheet as an XLSX file, saving it temporarily. It uses urllib3 to perform an HTTP GET request without any input validation or sanitization. The download process reads data in chunks and writes it directly to a temporary file. No external or untrusted input beyond the parameter is used, and the data flow appears straightforward and safe. The URL is hardcoded with a known spreadsheet ID, but no malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The use of tempfile is standard for temporary file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple and legitimate operation of downloading a spreadsheet and saving it locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
