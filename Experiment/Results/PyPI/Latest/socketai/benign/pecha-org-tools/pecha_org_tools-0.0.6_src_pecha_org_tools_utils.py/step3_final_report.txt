{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for reading and writing JSON files using standard Python libraries.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as arguments to open() in read_json and write_json functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing beyond file I/O, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "flows": "Input file path from read_json or write_json functions flows into open(), data read or written via json.load/json.dump.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises two simple functions that perform standard JSON file operations. Both functions use Python's built-in json module and open() for file handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions accept file paths, which could be misused if untrusted, but this is typical for utility functions and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of JSON read/write utilities with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
