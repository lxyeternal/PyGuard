  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to read from and write to JSON files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a file specified by 'file_path' in the 'read_json' function.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to a file specified by 'file_path' in the 'write_json' function.",
  "flows": "Input file path → reading JSON data → output data to file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of json.load and json.dump are standard for JSON handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'read_json' reads data from a file path and loads it as JSON; 'write_json' writes JSON data to a specified file path with indentation. Both functions use standard library functions without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No malicious intent, data exfiltration, or security issues are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for JSON file handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard utility for reading and writing JSON files with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as expected for JSON data processing.",
