  "flows": "Input file_path -> open() -> json.load() -> return data; data -> open() -> json.dump() -> output file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard json library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: read_json and write_json. read_json opens a specified file in read mode and loads JSON data. write_json opens a specified file in write mode and dumps JSON data into it. Both functions use standard Python library functions with no user input validation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic. The functions are simple and serve as utilities for JSON file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for reading and writing JSON files with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
