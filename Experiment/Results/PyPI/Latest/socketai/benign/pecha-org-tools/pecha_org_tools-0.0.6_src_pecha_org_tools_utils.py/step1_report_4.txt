  "purpose": "Utility functions to read from and write to JSON files",
  "sources": "File input via 'file_path' parameter in 'read_json' and 'write_json' functions",
  "sinks": "File writing operation in 'write_json' function; potential to overwrite files or write malicious data if input is malicious",
  "flows": "Data is read from a file in 'read_json' and then written to a file in 'write_json'; no external data processing or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; use of standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: 'read_json' loads JSON data from a specified file, and 'write_json' writes JSON data to a specified file with formatting. There are no obfuscated code patterns, dynamic execution, or suspicious control flows. No user input beyond file paths is processed, and no network or system commands are invoked. The functions perform standard file I/O operations using the json module, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and performs basic JSON file I/O without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks or malware indications in this fragment.",
