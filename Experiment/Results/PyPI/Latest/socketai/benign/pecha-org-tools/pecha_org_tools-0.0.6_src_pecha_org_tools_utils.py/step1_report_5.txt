  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to read from and write to JSON files",
  "sources": "File path input to read_json and write_json functions",
  "sinks": "File open and json.load/json.dump functions potentially writing to or reading from files",
  "flows": "Input file path -> open(file_path) -> json.load -> return data; Data -> open(file_path, 'w') -> json.dump",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious file paths or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions to handle JSON files: read_json and write_json. Both functions open files based on provided file paths and process JSON data accordingly. There are no input validations, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. The functions rely solely on Python's standard json and file handling modules. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. The code appears to be a simple utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for JSON file handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
