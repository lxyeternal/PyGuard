  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading from and writing to JSON files.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as input arguments to read_json and write_json functions.",
  "sinks": "json.load and json.dump functions, which handle file data; no external network or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "Input file_path flows into open(), data read into 'data', then potentially written back via write_json.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple file I/O operations using the json module. It reads data from a specified file in read_json and writes data to a specified file in write_json. Both functions use open() with user-provided file paths, which could be exploited if untrusted input is supplied, but this is typical for such utility functions. No data leaks, no network communication, no malicious code, and no obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic JSON file operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation of JSON read/write functions suitable for general use.",
