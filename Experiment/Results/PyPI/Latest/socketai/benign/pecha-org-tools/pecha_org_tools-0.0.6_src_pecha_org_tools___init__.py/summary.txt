  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution with some network activity, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are justified and consistent with the observations, with moderate suspicion in key reports. Further detailed static and dynamic analysis is recommended before full trust or deployment."
