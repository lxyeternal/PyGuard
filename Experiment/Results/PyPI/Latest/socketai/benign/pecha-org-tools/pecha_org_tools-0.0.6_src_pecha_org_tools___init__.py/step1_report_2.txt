  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing, possibly involving network communication or data manipulation. The exact intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables or input functions) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network calls, file operations, or system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are immediately apparent. There are no unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obfuscated constructs, unusual variable naming, or unnecessary dynamic evaluation. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. There are no explicit hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, or malicious system manipulations. The overall structure is straightforward, and no suspicious flows are detected based on the provided code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without including malware or security flaws.",
