  "purpose": "The code creates a specified output directory if it does not already exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, os.makedirs, and print functions which access the filesystem and output messages.",
  "targets": "The filesystem where directories are created and messages are printed; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input (output_dir parameter) is checked for existence; if missing, directory creation is attempted, with status messages outputted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code performs standard directory creation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python functions to check for the existence of a directory and creates it if missing, with error handling for directory creation failures. No user input is directly read; the directory path is passed as a parameter. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or hidden backdoors. No network activity, data leakage, or suspicious logic is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is straightforward code for creating a directory if it doesn't exist. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
