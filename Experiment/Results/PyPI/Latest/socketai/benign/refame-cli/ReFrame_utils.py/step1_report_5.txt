  "purpose": "Create an output directory if it does not exist",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'output_dir' received from function argument",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs() creates directory; print statements output information; no untrusted data handling beyond 'output_dir'",
  "flows": "Function checks 'output_dir' for existence, then creates directory if missing, and outputs status messages",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed; no malicious code or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it verifies if a directory exists at the given path and attempts to create it if not. It handles errors gracefully with exception handling. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. Usage of print statements for status output is benign and does not pose security concerns. The code relies solely on standard library functions, and there are no suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign directory creation function with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
