  "purpose": "CLI tool for video and image manipulation tasks such as extracting frames, converting images, and creating GIFs.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for input paths, output directories, formats, and other parameters.",
  "sinks": "External functions (extract_frames, convert_image, create_gif) that perform file operations based on user input.",
  "flows": "User inputs (paths, formats, options) flow from command-line arguments to functions that process files accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and imported modules appears typical for CLI utilities.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to execute specific functions related to media processing. The parameters are sanitized through argparse choices and types, reducing injection risk. No network activity, system modifications, or sensitive data handling is evident. The imported functions are assumed to handle file operations securely. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI utility for media processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely delegates tasks to well-defined functions with validated input parameters. Overall, the script itself does not contain malware or security issues.",
