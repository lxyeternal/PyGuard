{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for video and image processing tasks such as extracting frames, converting image formats, and creating GIFs.",
  "sources": "Input paths for video files, image files or directories, and output paths specified via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output directories and files where processed images or GIFs are saved, based on user input.",
  "flows": "User provides input paths; functions process these inputs and save results to specified output locations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that calls external functions for media processing. All input paths are provided by the user via arguments, and output paths are also user-specified. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. No embedded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard command-line interface for media processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply passes user inputs to imported functions without processing or transmitting data internally. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate media manipulation tasks.",
