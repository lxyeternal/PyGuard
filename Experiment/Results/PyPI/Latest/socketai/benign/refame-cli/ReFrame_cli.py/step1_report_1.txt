  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool for extracting frames from videos, converting images between formats, and creating GIFs from images.",
  "sources": "User-supplied arguments for input paths, output paths, formats, and parameters; potentially untrusted user input from CLI.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading from input paths and writing to output paths), subprocesses potentially invoked within imported functions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed directly to functions that perform file I/O based on user input, with no sanitization or validation shown in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious string manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses user input via argparse and calls functions imported from ReFrame modules to perform file and media processing tasks. It handles input paths, output paths, and format options, but does not include any code that directly executes system commands, processes untrusted data beyond file paths, or manipulates data insecurely within this snippet. The functions called are external, so potential risks depend on their implementations, but no malicious patterns are evident in this segment. The code structure is straightforward and typical for CLI tools, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for media processing functions with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this code segment. However, the overall security depends on the implementations of the imported functions, which are not shown here.",
