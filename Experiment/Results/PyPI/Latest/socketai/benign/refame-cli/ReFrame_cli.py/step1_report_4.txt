  "purpose": "Command-line interface tool for video and image processing tasks including frame extraction, image conversion, and GIF creation.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments: input_path, output_dir, output_path, input_dir, and other parameters for commands.",
  "sinks": "Functions that process files based on user inputs: extract_frames, convert_image, create_gif; these process user-specified files and directories.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from command-line arguments flow into respective functions to process files, e.g., input_path -> extract_frames or convert_image, input_dir -> create_gif.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No external network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around image/video processing functions, routing user inputs to respective processing functions. It only handles file paths and parameters without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI tool for media processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries for actual processing, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
