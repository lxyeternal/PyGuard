{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to convert images from one format to another, supporting batch processing and handling various image formats including HEIC/HEIF using Pillow and pillow-heif libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified file paths or directories, and also imports libraries such as cv2, os, sys, numpy, PIL, and custom utils.",
  "sinks": "Writes converted image files to output directories, deletes original files if in-place replacement is specified, and imports external libraries for HEIC/HEIF processing.",
  "flows": "Sources (image input files, libraries) flow into processing functions that read images, possibly convert formats, and then save or delete files, depending on configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic imports for pillow_heif within functions, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or secret leaks; no network communication, code injection, or backdoors detected; deletion of original files after conversion could be potentially destructive but is consistent with intended functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs image format conversion with support for multiple formats including HEIC/HEIF via pillow-heif. It handles both individual files and directories, with validation for output formats. It includes error handling for missing files, unsupported formats, and library dependencies. The use of dynamic import for pillow_heif is slightly unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is present. The deletion of original images after conversion could be destructive but aligns with the purpose of in-place replacement. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate image processing software without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate image format converter with no indications of malicious behavior. It handles image input/output securely, with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The only notable aspect is the optional deletion of original files, which should be used cautiously but does not indicate malicious activity.",
