  "purpose": "A utility to convert images between formats, supporting batch processing and HEIC/HEIF formats via pillow-heif.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified path or directory, including HEIC/HEIF via pillow_heif import.",
  "sinks": "Writes converted images to output directory; deletes original files if 'replace_original' is enabled.",
  "flows": "Input image files are read, processed (including optional HEIC/HEIF conversion), then saved; original files are deleted if replacement is enabled.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of pillow_heif; deletion of original files after conversion; use of sys.exit() in bulk mode; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image format conversions with validation, error handling, and optional batch processing. It supports multiple formats, including HEIC/HEIF via pillow_heif, and deletes original files if specified. No network activity, credential handling, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The dynamic import is justified for optional support. Error handling with sys.exit() is typical for CLI tools. The deletion of original files is a known feature, not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign image conversion utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor risk involves potential data loss due to file deletion, which is an intended feature. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code is clear and well-structured.",
