{
  "purpose": "This code converts images from one format to another, supporting batch processing of directories or individual files.",
  "sources": "Input image paths provided via command line or function arguments; reading files from disk; importing third-party libraries like pillow_heif, cv2, os, sys, numpy, PIL.",
  "sinks": "Saving converted images using cv2.imwrite() and PIL.Image.save(); deleting original files with os.remove().",
  "flows": "Input paths are validated; images are read using cv2 or Pillow; images are converted and saved in the specified format; original files are optionally deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of pillow_heif inside functions; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; no network activity or data exfiltration observed; proper input validation for file existence and formats.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image format conversions, utilizing well-known libraries and proper validation. It includes support for HEIF/HEIC formats through optional pillow_heif library. The file deletion step occurs only after successful conversion and appears controlled. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The use of dynamic imports for pillow_heif is justified for optional HEIC support. The overall structure is typical for an image processing utility, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image conversion utility without malicious intent. It securely processes images, performs format conversions, and manages files appropriately. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
