  "purpose": "Create an animated GIF from a directory of images, converting images to RGB and compiling them into a GIF file.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for image files, cv2.imread() for reading images, user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "imageio.mimsave() writes the GIF file to the specified output path.",
  "flows": "Read image files from directory -> convert images from BGR to RGB -> collect images -> save GIF to output path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks with proper validation and error handling. It reads images, converts color space, and creates a GIF. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code's behavior aligns with its purpose, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for creating GIFs from images, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
