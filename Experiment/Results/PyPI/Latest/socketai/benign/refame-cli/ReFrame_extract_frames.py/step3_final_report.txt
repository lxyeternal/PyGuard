  "purpose": "Extract frames from a video file within optional time ranges, saving them as images in specified formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input video file, checks existence, retrieves FPS, total frames, and optional start/end times.",
  "sinks": "Writes image files to output directory, no external network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Video file is opened, frames are read sequentially, frames are saved based on frame step, and progress is logged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External utility 'create_output_dir' assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard video frame extraction with proper validation, error handling, and resource management. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, and the external dependency appears benign. The minimal security risk score (0.1) reflects potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign utility for extracting frames from videos. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security threats are evident. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
