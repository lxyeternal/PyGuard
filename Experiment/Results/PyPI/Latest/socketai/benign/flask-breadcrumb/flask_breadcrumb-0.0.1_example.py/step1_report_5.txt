  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of Flask-Breadcrumb extension to generate and display breadcrumb navigation in a Flask web application.",
  "sources": "request.path (for current URL), get_breadcrumbs() (to retrieve breadcrumb data), and the request object for route parameters.",
  "sinks": "print statements (for logging breadcrumb JSON data). No data is sent over the network, stored, or written to files. Rendering templates is standard behavior.",
  "flows": "Route functions invoke get_breadcrumbs() which retrieves breadcrumb data based on current request context; data is printed to console for debugging; breadcrumb data is injected into HTML templates.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. The code appears to follow standard Flask patterns with no hidden or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets other than a placeholder SECRET_KEY; no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Flask application with several routes, each decorated with breadcrumb information. It uses request data and route parameters to generate breadcrumb JSON via get_breadcrumbs(). The breadcrumb data is logged to console and rendered in templates. No input sanitization issues or unsafe data handling observed. No external or network activity besides console logging. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Flask example demonstrating breadcrumb navigation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and practices. No malware or security threats identified.",
