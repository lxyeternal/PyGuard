  "purpose": "Set up a basic Flask application for testing with pytest.",
  "sources": "Import statements, app configuration",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present",
  "flows": "Input source (pytest fixture) creates app; configuration is internal; no flow to untrusted sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard test setup code with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture that creates and configures a Flask application for testing purposes. It uses standard Flask and pytest imports. There are no hardcoded credentials, no external data reads, or network activities. The code's structure and imports are typical for testing environments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code does not perform any dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for Flask applications using pytest. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is safe and normal for test environments.",
