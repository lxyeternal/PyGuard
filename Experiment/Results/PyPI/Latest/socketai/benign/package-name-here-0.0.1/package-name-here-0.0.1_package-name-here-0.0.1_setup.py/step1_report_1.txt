{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup with a custom install command that writes a message to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The import of os module, the setup() function parameters, and the run() method in PostInstallCommand that executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing 'echo ... > /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt', writing to the filesystem.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes and triggers the os.system command, which writes a message to a file in /tmp.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute a shell command during package installation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code beyond this. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that, upon installation, runs a shell command to write a static message to a file in /tmp. This is a benign behavior, likely a proof-of-concept or demonstration. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The use of os.system is notable but not inherently malicious in this context. Overall, the code appears to be a simple demonstration with no malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes a benign write operation during package installation. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The main concern is the use of os.system in install scripts, which can be risky if misused, but in this case, it only performs a simple echo to a file. Overall, this is a benign demonstration, with no significant security threats identified.",
