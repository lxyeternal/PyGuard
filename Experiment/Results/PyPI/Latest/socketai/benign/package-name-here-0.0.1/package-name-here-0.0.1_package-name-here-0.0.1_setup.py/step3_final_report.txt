{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, writes a static message to a file in /tmp as a demonstration or proof-of-concept.",
  "sources": "The static command executed via os.system during the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a shell command that writes to /tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt.",
  "flows": "The package installation process triggers the run method, which executes the os.system command, leading to writing the message to the file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system during install to run a static echo command; no dynamic input or obfuscation; no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign action during installation, writing a message to a file using a static shell command. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of os.system is generally discouraged but is safe here due to the static command. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign behavior. The primary concern with os.system would be if the command were dynamic or influenced by external input, which is not the case. Overall, the code is a simple demonstration with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, demonstration-level script that executes a static shell command during package installation. There is no malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
