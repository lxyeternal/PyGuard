  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package named 'lalpulsar', serving as a placeholder or stub.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata within the setup() call, including name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input, environment variables, or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks exists as the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard, static setup script with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic inputs, external data, or environment variables are used. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and justified given the static, placeholder nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, standard placeholder setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The analysis confirms that the code poses no security risks, and the scores accurately reflect its harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
