{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the port_checker module, testing port availability detection over TCP and UDP protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports socket module, mock objects, and the is_port_available function from port_checker.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks identified; tests primarily invoke the function with controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "Input port and protocol parameters flow into is_port_available, which uses socket operations to check port status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests with mocking to simulate network conditions. It tests various scenarios like port availability, port in use, retries, IPv6 support, and invalid inputs. Usage of socket module and mock objects appears standard for testing. No malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network connections are present. The tests are controlled, and no secret or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, safe set of unit tests for port checking functionality. No malicious behavior or security risks detected. The code appears well-structured and solely for testing purposes.",
