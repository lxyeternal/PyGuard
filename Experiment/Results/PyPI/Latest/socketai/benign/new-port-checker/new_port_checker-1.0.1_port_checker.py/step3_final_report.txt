{
  "purpose": "A port scanning utility that checks the availability of specified ports on a target host using socket connections, supporting both TCP and UDP protocols with configurable retries, timeouts, and concurrency.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command-line arguments, configuration files, and hostname/IP address via socket.getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Socket operations such as bind() for UDP and connect_ex() for TCP, and outputs results via print or JSON serialization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port/range, protocol, retries, timeouts) flow into socket connection/binding attempts, with results returned and displayed or serialized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. Validation and error handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard port scanning functions with proper validation, retries, and logging. It uses socket library for network checks, supports concurrency, and provides flexible configuration. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The socket operations are typical for port diagnostics, and no data exfiltration or backdoors are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by its benign purpose. The code's structure and behavior align with legitimate network diagnostic tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign port scanner with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain 0; the security risk score can be kept at approximately 0.2 to reflect potential misuse but no inherent danger.",
