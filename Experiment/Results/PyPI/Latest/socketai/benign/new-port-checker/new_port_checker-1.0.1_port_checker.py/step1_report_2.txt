{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to check the availability of network ports on a specified host, supporting both single port and range scans via TCP or UDP protocols, with options for concurrency, configuration, and output formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments, configuration file ('config.ini'), and hostnames/IP addresses provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "Data is used in socket connection attempts, port binding, and connection results are logged or outputted in JSON/text format.",
  "flows": "Input (host, port/range, protocol, configs) → validation and processing → socket connection/binding attempts → results stored or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys detected. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code's logic appears straightforward, mainly performing network socket checks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a port scanning tool that verifies port availability using socket connections for TCP and UDP. It performs input validation, supports concurrency for port range scans, and outputs results in multiple formats. No hidden or malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or unauthorized network activity is evident. The code uses standard libraries and techniques appropriate for its purpose. No suspicious patterns like malicious network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate network port scanner with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard socket operations for port checking, with proper validation and error handling. No malware or supply chain threats are detected.",
