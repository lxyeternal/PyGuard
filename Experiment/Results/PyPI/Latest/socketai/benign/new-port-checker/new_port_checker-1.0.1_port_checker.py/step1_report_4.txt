{
  "purpose": "This script provides a utility to check the availability of specific ports or ranges of ports on a given host, supporting both TCP and UDP protocols, with configurable parameters and output formats.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'config.ini', command-line arguments for host, port, range, protocol, timeout, retries, output format, and exclusion list.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket connections to check port status; outputs results to console or JSON; no data is sent or received over the network beyond port testing.",
  "flows": "Input from config and command-line → port checking functions → socket connection attempts → output formatting and display.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Use of standard libraries and typical port checking logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs port availability checks using socket connections with retries and timeout management. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The configuration and command-line parsing appear standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No external data exfiltration, network communication beyond port testing, or suspicious behavior identified. Logging is used for warnings and errors, but no sensitive data is logged. Overall, the code is a legitimate port testing utility without signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a port scanning tool without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It relies on common Python libraries and standard port check logic, with no evidence of backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity.",
