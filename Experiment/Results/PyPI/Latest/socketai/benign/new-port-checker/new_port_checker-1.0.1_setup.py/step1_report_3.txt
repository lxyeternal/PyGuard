  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python port checking tool.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, specifies package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system or data leaks. The code defines package configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> assigns content to long_description -> used in package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The use of open() is standard for setup scripts. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package. It reads a local README.md file for description, handles a missing file gracefully, and defines package metadata including entry points for command-line execution. All operations are standard and intended for package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
