  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'new_port_checker' that installs a command-line tool to check port availability.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; no other external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; no network or file writes beyond reading the README file.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> passes content to 'long_description' -> used in package metadata; no external flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file, falls back to a default description if not found, and defines package metadata including name, version, author info, and entry points for command-line scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern could be if the URL is malicious, but it appears to be a placeholder and is a common practice in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or process untrusted data. The code is benign.",
