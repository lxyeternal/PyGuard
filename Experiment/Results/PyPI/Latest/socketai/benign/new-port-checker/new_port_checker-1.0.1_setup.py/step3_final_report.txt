  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, entry points, and reading a README file for description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or file output beyond local file reading",
  "flows": "Input source (README.md) used for package description; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py pattern, placeholder URL, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file with a fallback message, defines package metadata, author info, and CLI entry points. No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The placeholder URL is common in initial templates. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
