  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'new_port_checker', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; retrieves package information from the setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or output functions are present",
  "flows": "Reads the README file, then passes static data to the setup() function; no untrusted data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It attempts to read a README file for the long description, with a fallback message. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line execution. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It follows common patterns for Python packaging without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
