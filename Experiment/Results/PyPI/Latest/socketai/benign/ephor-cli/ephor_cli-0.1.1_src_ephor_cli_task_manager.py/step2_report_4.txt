  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, malware risk, obfuscation, and overall validity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages AI agent tasks asynchronously, with no signs of malicious activity. The only concern is a print statement revealing internal state.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor, due to the print statement, but not a security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code appears benign, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard async task management with external dependencies. No malicious behavior or obfuscation noted.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minor info leak via print, but no real security concern.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on potential untrusted input processing via external functions, but no actual malicious code or secrets are found.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — similar minor concern due to print statement.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the straightforward nature of the code, with external functions being potential points but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code seems benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard async task manager, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given no suspicious elements.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero due to minor info leaks (print statements), which are not security risks per se.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minor info leak, no real security threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard implementation of an async AI agent task manager. No signs of sabotage, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The minor logging statement does not constitute a security risk. External dependencies' security depends on their implementation, but based on this code snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:** No action needed beyond standard security review of external functions and deployment environment.",
