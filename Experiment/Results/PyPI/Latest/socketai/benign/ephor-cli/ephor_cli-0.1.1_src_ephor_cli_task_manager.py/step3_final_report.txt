{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous AI agent task manager that initializes tools, manages tasks, and streams responses, facilitating AI workflows.",
  "sources": "External functions such as get_tools, create_agent, run_agent, run_agent_stream, and external data inputs like task requests and streaming chunks.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via print statements; no network or file system sinks are evident; external functions may process data but are not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data from task requests flows through initialization, task processing, and streaming functions; data from external functions flows into task updates and streaming responses.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a print statement that could leak internal state; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; reliance on external functions without internal validation may pose indirect risks.",
  "analysis": "The code manages AI agent tasks asynchronously, initializing tools and agents as needed. It processes tasks, streams responses, and updates task states. No malicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The print statement is a minor info leak, not malicious. External dependencies are standard for AI workflows. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The risk is minimal, primarily due to potential info leaks, but no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of an async AI agent task manager with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero. Minor info leaks via print statements do not constitute security threats.",
