  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages AI agent tasks asynchronously, with no signs of malicious activity. The only concern is the print statement leaking internal info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n- The print statement is not malicious but could leak info in production.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, given the potential info leak.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard task management and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious code, network calls, or backdoors.  \n- The external functions are standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident.  \n- The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's evaluation aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on potential untrusted input processing via external functions but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.  \n- External functions could process malicious input, but within this code, no malicious behavior is apparent.  \n- The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard async task management without malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious patterns or code.  \n- External dependencies are standard, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard AI task manager with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the absence of any suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minor concerns like logging info leaks, which are not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — minor info leak via print statement, but no serious vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low risk scores are justified, and the code appears safe for deployment.",
