{
  "purpose": "This code manages tasks for an AI agent, including initialization, task processing, and streaming responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google_a2a.common.server.task_manager', 'google_a2a.common.types', and 'ephor_cli.agent'. Functions like 'get_tools', 'create_agent', 'run_agent', and 'run_agent_stream'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'run_agent', 'run_agent_stream', 'create_agent', and 'get_tools' which involve external function execution, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from task request parameters to task management, agent initialization, and response streaming, primarily through function calls and async processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behavior. Use of async streams and task management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of an asynchronous task manager for an AI agent. It initializes tools, manages task states, processes streaming responses, and updates task status. All external functions seem to serve standard roles in agent management. No hardcoded credentials or malicious data handling are observed. The structure aligns with common patterns in AI workflow management. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical task manager for AI agent workflows with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It uses external APIs and async processing appropriately. No malicious intent or dangerous security issues are identified.",
