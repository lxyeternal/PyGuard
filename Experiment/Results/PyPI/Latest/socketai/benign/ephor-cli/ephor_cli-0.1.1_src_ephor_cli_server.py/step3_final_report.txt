  "purpose": "A web server handling agent requests via JSON-RPC, validating inputs, and delegating tasks to a task manager.",
  "sources": "Request body JSON, URL path parameters, imported modules, in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "JSON responses, event streams, exception handling, task manager method calls.",
  "flows": "Request JSON parsed and validated -> delegated to task_manager methods based on request type -> responses or streamed events returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling that could mask errors; 'raise ValueError' on missing agent IDs which could cause server crashes if unhandled; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, asynchronous API server built with Starlette, validating incoming JSON-RPC requests with Pydantic, routing them to appropriate task manager methods, and handling responses or streaming data. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external activity are present. Exception handling is generic but not malicious; potential stability issues are minor and unrelated to security. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The overall design appears secure and standard for such an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API server with no signs of malicious activity or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to lack of explicit access controls and broad exception handling, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2.",
