{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load agent configurations from YAML files, create agent cards, and register them with a proxy server to start an agent management service.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files from disk (load_agent_config), reads environment variables (load_dotenv), command-line input for file paths and server parameters.",
  "sinks": "Creates agent objects and registers them with the server (server.register_agent), potentially exposing agent identifiers and configurations. No untrusted data directly sent over network by this code itself.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration files -> parses data into agent objects -> registers agents with server -> server starts to listen for incoming connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious network domains, reverse shells, or data exfiltration code present. Usage of environment variables is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, object creation, and server initialization routines. It does not contain any unusual or malicious logic. It relies on external configuration files for agent details, which is a common pattern. No embedded or hidden code, no suspicious network activity, and no data leakage mechanisms are evident. The logging is for normal operational purposes. The usage of environment variables and third-party libraries appears standard. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical agent registration and server startup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe based on its content, assuming the configuration files are trustworthy.",
