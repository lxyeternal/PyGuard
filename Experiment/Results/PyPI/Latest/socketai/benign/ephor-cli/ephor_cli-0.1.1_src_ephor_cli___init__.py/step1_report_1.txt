{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load agent configurations from YAML files, create agent cards, and register these agents with a server for a proxy setup, then start the server.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from config files specified via command-line options; loads environment variables via dotenv.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to logs, server registration endpoints, and local files (if any are involved), and uses data in URL construction.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration files -> creates agent objects and tool configurations -> registers agents on the server -> server starts listening.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution; no suspicious network calls or hidden backdoors; environment variables are loaded but not directly used in code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles configuration loading, object creation, and server registration. It safely loads YAML files, constructs agent objects, and registers them without involving any user input in unsafe ways. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity is evident. Environment variables are loaded but not used maliciously. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Logging is used for debugging and informational purposes only. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found; sensitive info appears to be external configuration only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for loading agent configurations, creating agent objects, and registering them with a server. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware-like activity is detected. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic.",
