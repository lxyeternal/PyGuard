{
  "purpose": "This script loads agent configurations from YAML files, creates agent cards, and registers agents with a server to start a proxy server for agent communication.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from YAML files and environment variables; input options via command-line parameters",
  "sinks": "Uses data to instantiate objects, register agents on a server, and potentially expose URLs or configurations; no direct data leaks or injections observed",
  "flows": "Loads config files -> creates agent objects and capabilities -> registers agents with server -> starts server",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URLs; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Usage of environment variables is standard. No suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads configuration files, constructs agent objects, and registers them with a server. All data handling appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious network calls. The only potential concern is the dynamic loading of YAML configs which must be trusted, but this is typical for configuration scripts. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration and registration script for a proxy server. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It handles configurations securely and does not show signs of malware or malicious intent.",
