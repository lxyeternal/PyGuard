{
  "purpose": "Load agent configurations from YAML files, create agent objects (skills, capabilities, agent card), register agents with a server, and start the server.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration files, environment variables (via dotenv), external modules for agent and server management.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; configuration data is used internally for object creation and registration.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read (load_agent_config), data flows into agent object creation (create_agent_card), then into registration with the server, and finally server start.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity observed. Environment variables are loaded but not exploited maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, object instantiation, and server registration. It uses safe libraries (yaml.safe_load), handles exceptions properly, and logs operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. External YAML files could pose trust issues but are common in such scripts. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, straightforward configuration and registration utility for agent-based systems. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks beyond minimal trust assumptions on external configuration files. The overall security assessment aligns with the provided reports, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2).",
