{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket server implementation handling handshake, message framing, and client management with configurable callback functions.",
  "sources": "HTTP headers during handshake, incoming WebSocket frames from clients",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential misuse of callback functions if callbacks are maliciously set, but no direct data leaks or harmful actions are evident",
  "flows": "Handshake request -> accept key generation -> handshake response -> message reception -> frame parsing -> callback invocation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; callback functions are externally settable, which is standard but could be misused if compromised",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal WebSocket server with handshake, message framing, and client handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Callback functions are configurable, which is typical for extensibility but could be misused if callbacks are malicious. The code does not perform network exfiltration, data theft, or system compromise activities. The message parsing assumes complete frames in a single recv, which is acceptable for simplified implementations but not robust for production. Overall, the code is benign, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign WebSocket server implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk and malware scores should remain very low, around 0.0-0.2, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
