  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server that manages client connections, handles WebSocket handshake, framing, and messaging.",
  "sources": "recv() calls for receiving handshake and data frames from clients.",
  "sinks": "send() calls for sending handshake responses and framed messages to clients.",
  "flows": "Handshake request received -> create_accept_key() generates accept key -> server responds with handshake -> client sends data frames -> parse_websocket_frame() decodes frames -> _message_received() processes messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code or backdoors; standard WebSocket protocol handling; no external data leaks or network connections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket server with typical handshake and framing processes. It uses socket communication and threading for handling multiple clients. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or unauthorized network activity. The functions responsible for client management, message handling, and socket communication appear conventional and well-structured. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic detected. The security considerations seem limited to standard socket handling without external dependencies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical WebSocket server implementation without signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It manages WebSocket connections securely and straightforwardly, with no suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
