{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket server that handles client connections, manages message framing, and performs handshake procedures for WebSocket communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input during the WebSocket handshake via socket.recv(), and during message reception also via socket.recv(). The create_accept_key method uses input from request headers.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into the parse_websocket_frame method where incoming messages are decoded. Additionally, the server sends responses, including handshake responses and framed messages, via socket.send().",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket.recv() into parse_websocket_frame, then to _message_received callback, and responses are sent via self.sock.send() after framing messages.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets, but the code handles raw socket data without validation beyond basic handshake. No evident malicious code such as system command execution, data exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The handling of socket data appears standard and does not contain hidden backdoors or malware indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket server with proper handshake handling, message framing, and threading. It utilizes standard libraries and methods for socket communication, hashing, and encoding. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as unauthorized data access, command execution, or network connections to malicious hosts are present. All data flows are typical for a WebSocket server. The code manages client connections, processes WebSocket frames, and calls user-defined callback functions without embedded malicious logic. It appears to be a clean implementation of a WebSocket server without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain backdoors, hidden data leaks, or malware. The code appears safe, with standard security considerations for WebSocket handling.",
