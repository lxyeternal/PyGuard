  "purpose": "Implement a basic WebSocket server handling connections, message framing, and handshake.",
  "sources": "Reading incoming data from socket during handshake and message reception.",
  "sinks": "Sending handshake response, WebSocket frames, and closing socket connections.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket (source) flows through parsing and handshake functions, then to message handling and responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no external network connections beyond standard WebSocket operations, and no secret exfiltration or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket server with functions for handshake, message framing, and client handling. It provides mechanisms for setting callback functions for new clients, client disconnection, and message reception. The handshake properly generates the accept key using SHA1 and base64 encoding, and the message framing follows standard WebSocket protocol. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or hidden network activity is present. The code appears to be a standard implementation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward WebSocket server implementation with no detected malicious or sabotage elements. It adheres to expected protocol standards and does not contain suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.",
