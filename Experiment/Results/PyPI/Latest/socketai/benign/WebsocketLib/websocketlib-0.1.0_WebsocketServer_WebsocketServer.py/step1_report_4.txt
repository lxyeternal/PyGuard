  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server to handle client connections, message framing, and communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include client handshake requests, WebSocket frames received via socket.recv()",
  "sinks": "Sending handshake response headers, framing messages for clients, socket.send()",
  "flows": "Handshake request -> accept key generation -> response -> message reception -> message parsing -> message handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious backdoors or unusual code structures; functions are straightforward. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard WebSocket protocol procedures, including handshake processing, frame creation, and message parsing. It uses standard libraries and well-known methods for handling WebSocket frames, with no evident malicious code or suspicious behavior. No external data leaks, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Thread management appears standard; no suspicious network activity or dynamic code execution observed. The code structure is typical and does not include any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard WebSocket server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data theft mechanisms, or suspicious network activity. Overall, it is a benign implementation for managing WebSocket connections.",
