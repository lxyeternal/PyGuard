  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided details.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard WebSocket server implementation.\n- It handles handshake, message framing, client management, and threading.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The callback functions (_new_client, _client_left, _message_received) are settable, which is typical for flexible server design.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity to suspicious domains.\n- The code appears clean, with no suspicious patterns or hidden logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Finds the code to be a straightforward WebSocket server with no malicious intent, configurable callbacks, and low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious features.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; confirms standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is benign.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms standard WebSocket server with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard implementation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; no malicious features or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the server’s functionality and lack of malicious features.\n\n### Justification for the Scores\n- The code is a standard WebSocket server with configurable callbacks.\n- No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The callback pattern could theoretically be misused if callbacks are malicious, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- The low security risk score reflects the minimal vulnerabilities present, mainly related to typical socket handling and callback management.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** (low, standard server implementation)\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**This code appears benign, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent.**",
