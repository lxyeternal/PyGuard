{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the WebsocketServer module, likely to establish or manage WebSocket connections.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the WebsocketServer module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; only a module import without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Using a wildcard import ('*') can be considered bad practice as it may import unintended or malicious code, but it is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import statement from a local module. This suggests the module may handle WebSocket connections or related functionality. The import itself does not perform any malicious activity or pose security risks. However, without the actual content of WebsocketServer, it is impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or backdoors. The import pattern is not suspicious by itself, but the lack of context limits confidence.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple import statement. Nonetheless, the use of wildcard import should be noted as a poor practice for code clarity and maintainability. No evidence of malware or security threats is present in this isolated line.",
