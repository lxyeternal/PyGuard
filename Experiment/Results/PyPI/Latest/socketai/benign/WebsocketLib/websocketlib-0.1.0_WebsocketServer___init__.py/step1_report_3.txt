{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the WebsocketServer module, likely to establish or manage WebSocket connections.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads external module code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the WebsocketServer module that handles incoming data or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from WebsocketServer's internal functions to external systems or vice versa once imported.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure which parts of the module are used, but this is common in Python and not inherently malicious. No other suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports an entire module using a wildcard, providing no immediate malicious behavior or data flow. Without additional context or code, it’s impossible to determine malicious intent or security risks solely from an import statement. The use of wildcard imports is discouraged for clarity but is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. Additional context would be needed to assess the WebsocketServer module's content.",
