{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the WebsocketServer module, likely for establishing WebSocket communication.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from WebsocketServer module.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of imported classes or functions could lead to network connections, data handling, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Imported components could be used to receive data from untrusted sources and process them further.",
  "anomalies": "Single line import with wildcard could obscure what functions or classes are brought in; no direct malicious activity visible, but broad import can be risky if the module is malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports all definitions from a local module WebsocketServer. Without additional context or code, no malicious behavior is evident. The import alone does not pose security risk; however, if the WebsocketServer module contains malicious code, it could be used for harmful purposes such as network communication, data exfiltration, or command execution. The code's simplicity limits the ability to detect malicious intent solely based on this line. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are visible here. The overall risk depends on the content of WebsocketServer and how it is used.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself does not show malicious behavior but depends on the implementation of WebsocketServer. The broad import could be considered a minor concern if the module is untrusted, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
