  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are about a single line: `from .WebsocketServer import *`\n- The code is minimal, with no logic, data handling, or execution beyond import.\n- The primary concern revolves around the use of wildcard imports (`*`) and the potential for malicious content within the imported module.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all components from `WebsocketServer`.\n- **Findings:** No direct code execution or data flow; the risk hinges on the module content.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.3, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the import alone is benign but emphasizes reviewing the module. The low confidence and malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar import with a focus on establishing WebSocket connections.\n- **Findings:** Wildcard import is poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import all components, possibly for WebSocket server functionality.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; import is benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import all components for WebSocket services.\n- **Findings:** No logic or suspicious constructs; import is benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** High confidence in benign nature; the risk score of 0.2 is cautious but acceptable given the lack of context.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Similar import, potential for network or data handling.\n- **Findings:** No direct malicious activity; broad import could be risky if the module is malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no evidence of malware, but the broad import warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the fact that the import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent. However, **if the `WebsocketServer` module contains malicious code**, then importing it could execute malicious code at import time, which warrants a malware score > 0. Since we have no insight into the module's content, maintaining a malware score of 0 is acceptable but should be flagged for review.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies but remains low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the minimal code and lack of context.\n\n- **Use of Wildcard Import (`*`):** Consistently noted as poor practice but not inherently malicious. It can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or classes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Confirm the content of `WebsocketServer`.** If it is from a trusted source and well-maintained, the risk remains minimal.\n- **If the module is untrusted or unknown,** consider raising the malware score to reflect potential risk, especially if the module could contain malicious code that executes upon import.\n- **Update scores based on module trustworthiness:**\n  - Trusted module: malware = 0, risk = 0.1\n  - Untrusted module: malware > 0, risk > 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (unless module content is suspicious)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2, depending on trustworthiness of the module\n\n**Given only this import statement, I agree with the current low scores but recommend a review of the `WebsocketServer` module itself to confirm its safety.**",
