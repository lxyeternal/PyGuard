{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the WebsocketServer module, likely to establish WebSocket communication functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package, importing WebsocketServer.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import itself does not execute code or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; however, the imported module may contain source-to-sink flows if used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no initialization or logic; this alone is not suspicious but warrants reviewing the imported module for malicious content.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a module named WebsocketServer from the current package. There are no input operations, data processing, or code execution beyond the import. The lack of additional code makes it difficult to assess malicious intent solely from this snippet. The security implications depend entirely on the content of WebsocketServer. If the module contains malicious code, it could execute upon import, but that cannot be determined here. The minimal import statement itself does not show any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious behavior. However, the security risk depends on the contents of the WebsocketServer module, which should be reviewed separately. Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
