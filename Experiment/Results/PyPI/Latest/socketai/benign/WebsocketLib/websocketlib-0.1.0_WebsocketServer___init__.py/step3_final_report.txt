{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the WebsocketServer module, likely to utilize its functionalities in the current context.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the WebsocketServer module contains network operations or data handling, those could be sinks, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this minimal code; the import may enable subsequent code to access functions or classes within WebsocketServer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported components; no suspicious code or obfuscation present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no logic or data processing. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the WebsocketServer module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious. Scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal code. The security implications depend on the module's content, not the import statement itself.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation; no malicious behavior is evident. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the WebsocketServer module, which requires separate review. Current scores are consistent with this assessment.",
