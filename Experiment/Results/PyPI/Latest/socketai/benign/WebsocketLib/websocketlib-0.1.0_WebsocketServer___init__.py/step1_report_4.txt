{
  "purpose": "This code imports all components from the WebsocketServer module, likely to establish or manage WebSocket server functionality within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement suggests the source is the WebsocketServer module, which may read network data or configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network operations performed by WebsocketServer, such as opening sockets, listening for connections, or sending/receiving data.",
  "flows": "Data could flow from external network inputs into WebsocketServer, and potentially lead to network transmission or processing, but no specific source-to-sink flow is evident in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; it does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that imports all components from the WebsocketServer module. It does not contain any logic, input handling, or suspicious constructs. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The import could be part of a larger, benign application setting up WebSocket services.",
  "conclusion": "This code alone is benign, representing a standard import statement. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
