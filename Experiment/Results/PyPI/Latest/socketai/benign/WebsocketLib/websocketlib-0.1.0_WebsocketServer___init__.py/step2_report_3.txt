  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports are based on the same minimal code: `from .WebsocketServer import *`\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no additional logic.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which is generally discouraged because it obscures what is imported and can lead to namespace pollution.\n- None of the reports indicate actual malicious behavior within this snippet; they all emphasize that the real risk depends on the content of the `WebsocketServer` module itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n\n- **Is the code malicious?** No. The import statement alone is benign.\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?** No syntax errors or obvious flaws. The only concern is the practice of wildcard import, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious or untrusted.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports correctly state that the security implications depend on the contents of `WebsocketServer`.\n- They acknowledge that the import itself does not execute code or handle data directly.\n- The concern about wildcard import is valid but does not constitute a security threat by itself.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the minimal code and the potential for issues if the module is malicious.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n\n- Since the actual module content is unknown, a cautious approach might assign a slightly higher risk if the module is untrusted.\n- However, based solely on this import statement, the risk remains low.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- Wildcard imports (`*`) are discouraged because they make it difficult to track what is imported and used.\n- If the `WebsocketServer` module is from an untrusted source, it could contain malicious code that executes upon import, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet) — consistent with all reports.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of evidence, a conservative score of around **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate. The existing scores (mostly 0.1 to 0.2) seem reasonable.\n\n**Overall malware and obfuscation scores:** I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations:\n\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the `WebsocketServer` module, not the import statement itself.\n- For better security hygiene, avoid wildcard imports and specify explicitly what is imported.\n- Review the content of `WebsocketServer` for malicious code if it is from an untrusted source.\n\n---\n\n## Final conclusion:\n\n**The code snippet is benign in isolation.** The security risk hinges on the content and trustworthiness of the `WebsocketServer` module, which cannot be determined from this import statement alone.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import practice, but not malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided in the reports, with a slight emphasis on cautiousness regarding the module's trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; no malicious activity is evident from this import statement alone. The scores are reasonable, and the main security concern is the potential malicious content within the imported module, not the import statement itself.",
