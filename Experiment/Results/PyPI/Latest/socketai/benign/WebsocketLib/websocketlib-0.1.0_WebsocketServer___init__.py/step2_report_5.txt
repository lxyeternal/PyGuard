  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Confirmation & Content:**\n- All reports are about the same minimal code snippet:\n```python\nfrom .WebsocketServer import *\n```\n- The code only performs an import; no functions, data processing, or execution occurs here.\n\n**2. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The import statement itself is straightforward and matches the description.\n- No direct evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns is present in this snippet.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability but is not inherently malicious.\n\n**3. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly note that the security implications depend on the content of `WebsocketServer`.\n- They acknowledge that the import alone does not demonstrate malicious activity.\n\n**4. Score Evaluations:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; considering the import alone, this seems appropriate. However, if the module contains malicious code, the risk could be higher.\n\n**5. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which aligns with the minimal code snippet.\n- The risk would only be higher if the module `WebsocketServer` contains malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**6. Potential Malicious Behavior & Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import statement.\n- They highlight that the actual risk depends on the module's content, which is unknown here.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are moderate, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of module content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code in this import statement.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — reasonable given the minimal info; could be higher if the module is malicious, but that cannot be determined here.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The critical security concern is the content of the `WebsocketServer` module itself, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious; it could pose maintainability issues but not direct security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the current scores are appropriate**. The import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior or significant security risk. The real concern lies in the module's content, which warrants separate review.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0.2 if considering the potential for malicious code in the module)\n\n**Work through this carefully and confirm that no additional context suggests otherwise.**",
