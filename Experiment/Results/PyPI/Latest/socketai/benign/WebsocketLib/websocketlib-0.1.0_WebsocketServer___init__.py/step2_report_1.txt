  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports are based solely on a single import statement: `from .WebsocketServer import *`.\n- The code snippet is minimal, with no additional logic, data handling, or execution.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and difficulty in understanding what is imported.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious content within the `WebsocketServer` module itself; their assessments are cautious and based on the import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n\n**Are there any actual issues in the code?**\n\n- The code itself is benign: a straightforward import statement.\n- The only potential concern is if the imported module contains malicious code, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- No evidence of code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in the snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are directly present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the scores and reasoning\n\n**Scores given:**\n\n- Confidence ranges from 0.3 to 0.8, which seems appropriate given the minimal information.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the lack of evidence.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n- Security risks are low, mostly around 0.1-0.2, justified by the use of wildcard import and potential for malicious modules.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n- The scores seem consistent with the reasoning that the code itself is benign but warrants caution due to import practices.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- If a higher score were assigned, it would need to be justified by evidence of malicious code or dangerous behavior, which is absent here.\n\n---\n\n### Malware scoring\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Since the module content is unknown, the cautious approach is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions and claims\n\n- Many reports mention that the use of `import *` can be risky or bad practice. This is true for code clarity and maintainability but does not imply malicious intent.\n- No report claims or assumes the module is malicious; they only suggest potential risks if the module is untrusted.\n- All reasoning is cautious and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and reasoning provided.\n- No contradictions are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and recommendations\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to wildcard import practice, not malicious intent)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is benign in isolation.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the `WebsocketServer` module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- The import pattern alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n- The code snippet is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior.\n- The concern about the module's content remains valid but cannot be addressed without further inspection.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the overall security posture based on this snippet is low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Focus on reviewing the actual `WebsocketServer` module for malicious code if needed, but the import statement itself is not suspicious.",
