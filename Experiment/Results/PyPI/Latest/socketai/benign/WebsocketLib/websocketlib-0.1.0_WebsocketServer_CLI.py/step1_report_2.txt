{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a WebSocket server and allows dynamic assignment of callback functions for client connection events and message handling.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for server configuration; imports 'code', 'sys', 'argparse', and 'WebsocketServer'. Uses 'sys.version' and 'sys.platform' for banner information.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'globals()' to create server instances dynamically; executes 'console.interact' which may evaluate user input in the interactive console.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> server creation via 'globals()' -> setting callback functions -> launching interactive console with 'console.interact' -> user input in console can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'globals()[server_name]' for dynamic server instantiation, which can be manipulated if 'server_name' is controlled; launching an interactive console that evaluates user input is potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines callback functions for WebSocket events. It creates a server instance with a name provided by command-line argument, which could be exploited if the input is maliciously crafted. The use of 'globals()' for dynamic variable assignment is risky if user input is not sanitized. The script then starts an interactive console with 'code.InteractiveConsole', which allows executing arbitrary code entered by the user, posing a significant security risk. The inclusion of 'sys.version' and 'sys.platform' in the banner is benign. Overall, the code facilitates an environment where arbitrary code execution is possible via the interactive console, especially if accessed by an untrusted user.",
  "conclusion": "The script presents a high security risk due to its use of an interactive console that executes arbitrary user input and dynamic variable assignment through 'globals()'. It does not contain malicious payloads intentionally but provides an environment that can be exploited for malicious purposes if accessed improperly. The overall security risk is high.",
