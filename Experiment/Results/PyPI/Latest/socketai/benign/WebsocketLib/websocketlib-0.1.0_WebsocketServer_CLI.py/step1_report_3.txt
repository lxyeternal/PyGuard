{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures a WebSocket server using the WebsocketServer library, allowing interactive setup and client event handling.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (server_name, host, port) for server configuration; uses imported 'code' and 'sys' modules for environment info and interactive console.",
  "sinks": "Uses the server_name variable to dynamically create global server instances; sets callback functions for client connection, message reception, and disconnection.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> globals() assignment -> server setup -> setting callback functions -> launching interactive console",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically creates a server instance based on user input without validation; launches an interactive console which could be exploited if run in an untrusted environment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines callback functions for WebSocket events. It uses argparse to parse user input for server configuration, then dynamically creates a server instance with a name specified by the user, which could lead to variable overwrites or malicious injection if misused. It also initiates an interactive console with access to globals, potentially exposing sensitive data if accessed maliciously. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The code's main concern lies in the dynamic server creation and the interactive console launch, which could be exploited if run in an untrusted environment.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself does not contain malicious behavior but has security risks related to dynamic execution and environment exposure. It should be used cautiously, especially with untrusted inputs or in production environments.",
