{
  "purpose": "To initialize and run a WebSocket server with customizable client connection and message handling functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments (server_name, host, port), and the WebsocketServer class initialization which takes host and port as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic execution of code via the InteractiveConsole, which can execute arbitrary code input by the user; setting callback functions for client events, which could be exploited if malicious functions are provided.",
  "flows": "Command-line args are used to set server parameters, then code dynamically assigns a WebSocket server instance to a global variable based on user input, then launches an interactive console for user commands and code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code allows dynamic creation of global variables based on user input for server name, and launches an interactive console that can execute arbitrary code, both of which pose security concerns. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive info are present. The use of 'globals()' to create variables dynamically is unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a WebSocket server based on user-provided parameters via command-line arguments, which could be manipulated if malicious input is supplied. The use of 'globals()' for dynamic variable assignment is risky, as it could overwrite existing variables or introduce unintended behavior. The script then opens an interactive console, which permits execution of arbitrary code, a significant security risk if accessible to untrusted users. No malware code, network exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The overall structure appears intended for local or controlled use, but if exposed, it could enable remote code execution or server hijacking.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no explicit malware but exhibits risky practices such as dynamic variable assignment and an interactive console that could execute arbitrary code. These behaviors could be exploited if the script is run in an untrusted environment or exposed to malicious input. Overall, the script is not malicious per se but has significant security risks due to its design.",
