{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a WebSocket server with user-defined callback functions for client connection, disconnection, and message receipt, providing an interactive console for server management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for server configuration, imports modules (code, sys, argparse, WebsocketServer), and user-defined callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic execution of code.InteractiveConsole for interactive shell access, potential to execute arbitrary code entered into the console.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are used to configure the server; callback functions are set; then an interactive console is spawned for user input, enabling arbitrary code execution within the server context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of code.InteractiveConsole to spawn an interactive shell poses significant risk of arbitrary code execution; reliance on user input for server setup is typical but in this context could allow malicious commands if exploited.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a WebSocket server with specified host and port via command-line arguments, assigns callback functions for handling client events, and opens an interactive console session for manual command execution. The key security concern is the use of 'code.InteractiveConsole', which provides an unrestricted Python environment accessible during runtime, potentially allowing malicious or unintended code execution. The import of 'WebsocketServer' appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are observed. The reliance on user-supplied arguments for server configuration is normal but could be exploited if input is not sanitized, although the risk here is limited to server misconfiguration. The script does not include data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The core security risk stems from the interactive console, which if accessible to an attacker, can execute arbitrary code. Overall, the code itself does not contain malicious behavior but opens a significant security risk through the interactive console.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up a WebSocket server with standard callback functions and provides an interactive console for user commands. The main security concern is the use of an unrestricted Python interactive shell, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if accessed by malicious actors. No malicious code or backdoors are present, but the environment created is inherently risky.",
