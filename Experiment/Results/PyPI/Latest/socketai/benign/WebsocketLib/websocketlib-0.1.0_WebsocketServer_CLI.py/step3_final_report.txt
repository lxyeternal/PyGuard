  "purpose": "This script sets up a WebSocket server with user-defined callback functions and launches an interactive Python console, allowing arbitrary code execution within the environment.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for server configuration, dynamic assignment via globals(), and the interactive console input.",
  "sinks": "The interactive console (`console.interact`) which can execute any code, and the dynamic globals assignment which can overwrite existing variables.",
  "flows": "Input arguments influence server setup; `globals()[server_name]` assigns the server instance; user input in the console can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `globals()` for dynamic variable creation and launching an interactive console that permits arbitrary code execution without restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a WebSocket server with user-defined callback functions, dynamically assigns the server instance to a global variable based on user input, and then opens an interactive console. While no malicious payloads are present, the use of `globals()` for dynamic variable creation and the `code.InteractiveConsole` pose significant security risks if the environment is exposed to untrusted users. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the environment's design allows for arbitrary code execution, which could be exploited maliciously. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is embedded. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is high (~0.75-0.9), depending on environment exposure, due to the potential for arbitrary code execution via the console and dynamic globals.",
  "conclusion": "The script is not malicious but creates a high-risk environment due to its capacity for arbitrary code execution through the interactive console and dynamic global variable assignment. It should be used with caution, especially in environments accessible to untrusted users. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, but the security risk score should be elevated to reflect the environment's potential for exploitation.",
