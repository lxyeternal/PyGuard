  "conclusion": "The script is not malicious but creates a high-risk environment due to its capacity for arbitrary code execution through the interactive console and dynamic global variable assignment. It should be used with caution, especially in environments accessible to untrusted users. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, but the security risk score should be elevated to reflect the environment's potential for exploitation."
