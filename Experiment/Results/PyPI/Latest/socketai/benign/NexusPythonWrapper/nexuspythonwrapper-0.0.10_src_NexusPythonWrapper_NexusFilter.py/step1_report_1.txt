{
  "purpose": "This code defines a NexusFilter class used to construct filter query structures, likely for database or API querying, supporting logical operators, filter methods, and nesting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods such as 'where', 'nested', and constructor arguments; class variables for filter operators and methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'build' method outputs JSON strings representing filter structures; no external system interactions, network calls, or data leaks directly in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation and assignment -> internal data structures (_where, _nested) -> 'build' method -> JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of 'json.dumps' on a constructed dictionary is standard. No unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to build complex filter queries with validation on filter operators and methods. It uses standard data validation and string conversion for JSON output. No external data reads or untrusted data flows outside method parameters are apparent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code structure is straightforward and appears intended for query construction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard query filter builder with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation and produces JSON representations of filters. There is no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious code embedded.",
