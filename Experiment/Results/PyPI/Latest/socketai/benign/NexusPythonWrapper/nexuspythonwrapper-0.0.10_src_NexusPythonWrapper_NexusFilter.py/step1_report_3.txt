{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class NexusFilter for constructing filter criteria with logical operators, supporting nested filters, likely for use in database queries or filtering data sets.",
  "sources": "User inputs for method parameters such as 'operator', 'field', 'value', 'method', 'invert', and nested NexusFilter objects",
  "sinks": "None evident. The code serializes filter configurations into JSON strings, which are then returned. No direct data leaks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence the filter configuration via method calls; the data flows into internal structures (_where, _nested) and is ultimately serialized into JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or misleading code. The code performs straightforward data structure management and validation.",
  "analysis": "The class validates input parameters against predefined sets, constructs nested filter structures, and serializes them into JSON. No external network calls or data leaks are present. All inputs are processed safely, with validation checks in place for filter operators and methods. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of building query filters without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filter builder with input validation and nested structure support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
