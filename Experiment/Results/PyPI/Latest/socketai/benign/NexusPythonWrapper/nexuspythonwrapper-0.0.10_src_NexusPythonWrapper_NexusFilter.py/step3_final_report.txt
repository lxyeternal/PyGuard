  "purpose": "Constructs nested filter query structures with validation for operators and methods, serializing to JSON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'operator', 'field', 'value', 'method', 'invert'; internal lists '_where', '_nested'.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() for serialization; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input validation on 'operator' and 'method' -> appending filter dicts to internal lists -> build() compiles structure -> serialization with json.dumps().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Validation is standard; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on 'operator' and 'method', constructs nested filter structures, and serializes them into JSON. It does not perform external calls, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard filter builder with proper validation and serialization. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
