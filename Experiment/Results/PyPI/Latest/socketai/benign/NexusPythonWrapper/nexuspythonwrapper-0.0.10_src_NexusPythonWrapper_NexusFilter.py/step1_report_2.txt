{
  "purpose": "This code defines a NexusFilter class used to build nested filter conditions for querying or filtering data, likely in a database or data processing context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as 'operator', 'field', 'value', 'method', and 'invert'. These are provided by the user when calling methods like where(), nested(), or during class instantiation.",
  "targets": "Targets are primarily internal data structures (_where, _nested) and the JSON string output generated by build() and __str__(). These are used for query construction and do not perform external data transmission.",
  "flows": "User inputs (e.g., field names, values, methods) are stored in internal structures and then serialized into JSON via build() or __str__(). No untrusted data flows into system commands or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code performs standard data validation and serialization tasks. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully validates filter operators and methods, preventing invalid inputs. It constructs filter conditions with optional inversion and nesting. The methods are straightforward and do not involve any external or system calls. The JSON output is a serialization of the filter structure, which appears intended for query construction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears to be safe query building without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The NexusFilter class is a standard filter builder implementation with proper validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and suitable for its intended purpose.",
