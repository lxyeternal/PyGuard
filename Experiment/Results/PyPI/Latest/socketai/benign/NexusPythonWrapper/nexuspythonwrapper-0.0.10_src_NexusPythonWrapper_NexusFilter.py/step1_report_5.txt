{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for constructing nested filter query structures with logical operators and methods for validation and building JSON representations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as 'operator', 'field', 'value', 'method', 'invert', and 'nexus_filter' objects created via method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include json.dumps() for serializing the filter structure, which is a standard operation. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into internal structures (_where, _nested), then into the build() method, and finally into json.dumps() output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are evident. The code performs validation on input parameters and constructs a nested dictionary structure.",
  "analysis": "The class uses validated inputs for operators and methods, avoiding injection vectors in those parameters. The only serialization occurs via json.dumps(), which is safe if the input data (values) are properly validated or sanitized elsewhere. No external data sources, network calls, or insecure eval-like operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward filter builder with validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filter-building utility with proper input validation and safe serialization. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code does not include any hidden or suspicious functionality.",
