  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client wrapper; no malicious intent or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The low security risk score reflects minor concerns like logging at debug level and optional disabling of SSL verification, which are standard but could be misused. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; the report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client patterns, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. It highlights proper handling of credentials, response validation, and no suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client; no malicious intent, with a note on SSL verification being disabled as a security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly points out that disabling SSL verification is a security concern but not malicious. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard CRUD operations, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code, emphasizing that the code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential security concerns, mainly about logging sensitive data and the optional disabling of SSL verification.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The mention of logging sensitive data is valid; however, this is a security best practice concern rather than malware. No signs of malicious code or behavior are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is cautious but correct; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All agree on 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to optional SSL verification disabling and debug logging of sensitive info, but these are configuration issues, not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the optional disabling of SSL verification and debug logging, a score of 0.2 seems reasonable. These are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is a straightforward API client wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Due to potential misconfiguration (disabling SSL verification, debug logs exposing sensitive info), but no active threats.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and aligned with standard API client practices. The security concerns are configuration-related rather than malicious.\n\n---",
