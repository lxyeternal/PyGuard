  "purpose": "Unit testing for the NexusFilter class to verify filtering logic and method behaviors",
  "sources": "Importing NexusFilter class from NexusPythonWrapper module",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external calls present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks beyond class method calls",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest implementation testing various methods and behaviors of the NexusFilter class. It verifies operator case-insensitivity, exception handling for invalid operators and methods, correct structure of filter conditions, and nested filter functionality. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious code patterns are present. The module appears solely to perform logical unit testing without side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate test suite for a filter class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
