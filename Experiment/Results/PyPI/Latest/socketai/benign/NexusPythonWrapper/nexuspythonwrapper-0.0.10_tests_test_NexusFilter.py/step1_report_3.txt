  "purpose": "Unit tests for the NexusFilter class, verifying filter creation, operator handling, method validation, and nested filter behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports 'unittest' and 'NexusPythonWrapper.NexusFilter'.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code creates NexusFilter instances, calls methods, and performs assertions. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward suite of unit tests for the NexusFilter class, testing operator normalization, validation of input values, building filter structures, and nested filters. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All interactions are within testing scope and do not involve data leaks or malicious code. No external inputs, environment variables, or network operations are present. The structure and methods used are typical for unit testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard unit tests for a filtering class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
