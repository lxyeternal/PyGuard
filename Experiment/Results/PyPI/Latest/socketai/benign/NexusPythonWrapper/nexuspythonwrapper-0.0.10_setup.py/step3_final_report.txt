  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; package metadata fields; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in author_email ('mattew' instead of 'matthew'), but benign; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, following standard practices. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The typo in the email address is minor and does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's structure and content are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
