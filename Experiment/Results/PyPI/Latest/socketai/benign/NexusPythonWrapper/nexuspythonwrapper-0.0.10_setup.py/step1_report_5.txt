  "purpose": "Configure the setup for packaging and distributing the NexusPythonWrapper Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data is static or from controlled sources during setup.",
  "flows": "Data from files and static configuration flows into setup parameters; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard setuptools setup conventions with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for long description and defining package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted sources are processed. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is used. The dependencies and package configurations are static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
