  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the NexusPythonWrapper Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; reading package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); defining dependencies and package data; setting up entry points for command-line interface.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network operations or data handling beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> configure package metadata -> setup dependencies and entry points -> package installation and distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, no network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no indications of code injection, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The only external input is the README.md file, which is typical for such scripts. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
