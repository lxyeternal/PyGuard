  "purpose": "A simple data container class for handling response results, with methods to extend and serialize data.",
  "sources": "The class reads data from method parameters (`rows`) in `extend()`, and from class attributes during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code serializes data to JSON but does not process external untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (`rows`) into the `result` list and `metadata` dictionary, then to JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not perform suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a `Result` class with methods to extend its data and serialize to JSON. It handles both list and `Result` inputs correctly, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The reports only indicate 'Empty response' errors with no payload or suspicious content, suggesting operational issues rather than security threats. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or code execution, and uses standard Python constructs. Given the lack of malicious indicators, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is minimal. The reports do not provide evidence of malicious activity, and the empty responses are likely benign or data retrieval issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports only mention empty responses, which are operational rather than security concerns. Scores should reflect a very low malware and obfuscation risk, with a minimal overall security risk.",
