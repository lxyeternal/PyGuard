  "sinks": "The __all__ list, which specifies exported symbols",
  "flows": "Imported classes are assigned to local names; __all__ references string names for export",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ list includes 'endpoints', but the imported class is 'NexusEndpoints', leading to a mismatch",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for public API. The import 'from .endpoints import NexusEndpoints' suggests the class is named 'NexusEndpoints'. However, __all__ includes the string 'endpoints', which does not match the imported class name. This mismatch could cause runtime import errors if external code tries to import 'endpoints' from this module. The code itself is straightforward and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only issue is a likely typo or oversight in the __all__ list, which should be corrected to 'NexusEndpoints' to match the imported class name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for package initialization, with no malicious intent. The only concern is a typo in the __all__ list that could cause runtime errors. Correcting the __all__ to include 'NexusEndpoints' instead of 'endpoints' will resolve this minor issue. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score should be set to 0.1 due to the potential for runtime errors, but it is not a security threat.",
