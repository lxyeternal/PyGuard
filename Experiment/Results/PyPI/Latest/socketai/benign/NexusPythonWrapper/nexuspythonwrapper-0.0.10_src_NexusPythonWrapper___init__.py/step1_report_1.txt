{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be setting up imports and exports for a Python package related to Nexus, likely for organizing functionalities like endpoints, filtering, sorting, and wrapping.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .endpoints, .NexusFilter, .NexusSort, .NexusWrapper",
  "sinks": "The __all__ list is used to define exported symbols; no untrusted data handling or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific classes and then declares which names are available for import elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard import/export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from local modules and then defines __all__ to specify the public API. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network connections, data leaks, or code injections. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be purely organizational.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package module setup with import statements and a public API declaration. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
