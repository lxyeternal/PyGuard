  "purpose": "A URL builder class for constructing API endpoints with various parameters and paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as base_uri, table_name, params, key_value, field_name, which are used to generate URL strings.",
  "sinks": "Returns URL strings; no data leaks, network requests, or code execution occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into string formatting and urlencode functions to produce endpoint URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for constructing URLs based on input parameters. It uses standard string formatting and urlencode for query parameters, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any network operations or handle untrusted data beyond URL encoding, which mitigates injection risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1). The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL construction utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
