  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code behavior, potential vulnerabilities, malware presence, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward URL builder class for API endpoints.\n- It uses standard Python string formatting and `urlencode` for query parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No network requests, data processing, or execution of untrusted code.\n- No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n- The code relies on external input parameters; however, they are URL-encoded, reducing injection risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain vulnerabilities like code injection, data leaks, or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The code is a simple URL construction utility, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of malicious activity or payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- The reports assign low security risk (~0.1 or 0).  \n- Since the code is a URL builder with no execution or data handling, the risk is minimal.  \n- However, because the URLs are constructed from user-provided parameters, if these are used insecurely elsewhere, risks could arise, but within this code, no such issues are present.\n\n**Scores consistency:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- They emphasize the safe use of `urlencode` and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**          | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**          | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk     | **0.1**        | Minimal risk; depends on external use, but code itself is safe. |\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, I would even consider lowering the security risk score to 0, unless there's context where input validation is handled insecurely elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard URL construction utility with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative)\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' findings and supports their conclusions.",
