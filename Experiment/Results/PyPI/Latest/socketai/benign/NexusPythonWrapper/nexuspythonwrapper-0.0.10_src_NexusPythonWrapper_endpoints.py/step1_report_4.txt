{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class to generate various API endpoint URLs for a Nexus system, including login, logout, version, row, and business object endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as base_uri, params, table_name, key_value, field_name, which are used to construct URLs.",
  "sinks": "The URL strings generated and returned by the methods, which could be used to send requests or be logged.",
  "flows": "Inputs (base_uri, params, identifiers) flow into URL construction, resulting in URL strings that can be used to access endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code straightforwardly constructs URLs based on provided parameters.",
  "analysis": "The class methods dynamically generate URLs for specific API endpoints by concatenating strings and encoding parameters. No external data is processed beyond URL encoding, and no data leaks or insecure operations are evident. The code does not include any network connections, data collection, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a utility for URL generation within a larger application context. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard URL builder for API endpoints with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe string operations and parameter encoding without any suspicious logic.",
