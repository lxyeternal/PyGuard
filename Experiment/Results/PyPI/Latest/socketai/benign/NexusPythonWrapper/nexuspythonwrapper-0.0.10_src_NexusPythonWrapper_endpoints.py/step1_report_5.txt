{
  "purpose": "Provide URL endpoints for various operations related to Nexus security, version, data row, and business objects",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as base_uri, params, table_name, key_value, field_name, used to construct URLs",
  "sinks": "Generated URLs that could be used in HTTP requests; no direct data leaks or injections, but URLs may be manipulated if input is untrusted",
  "flows": "Input parameters are concatenated or encoded to form URLs, which can be used in network requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code detected; no unusual language features or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to generate URLs based on input parameters, applying URL encoding to prevent injection issues. No untrusted data is directly used in dangerous contexts, and the code does not perform network operations or data processing beyond URL formation. The functions seem straightforward and intended for URL construction; no signs of malicious intent or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard URL endpoint generator for a Nexus web interface. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is simple and secure, assuming input validation is handled elsewhere. No malware or malicious activities are evident.",
