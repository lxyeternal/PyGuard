  "purpose": "Constructs various endpoint URLs for interacting with a web service related to Nexus, including login, logout, version, row data, and business object endpoints.",
  "sources": "The base_uri provided during class instantiation; method parameters such as params, table_name, key_value, field_name.",
  "sinks": "Returning formatted URL strings that include query parameters built with urlencode.",
  "flows": "Base URI + specific endpoint path + optional query parameters constructed from method arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward URL construction with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for URL construction with methods to generate specific endpoints. It uses input parameters to assemble URLs safely, applying standard string formatting and urlencode for query parameters. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The methods are simple and do not perform any data validation or access control checks, but they do not contain malicious intent by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating URLs to interact with a web API. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious anomalies. It is a straightforward implementation of URL formatting functions.",
