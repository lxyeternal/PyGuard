{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for building and serializing sorting parameters as JSON or Python data structures.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as 'field', 'ascending', and 'raw'.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'build' method, which outputs JSON serialization of sorting parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments ('field', 'ascending', 'raw') through appending to '_sort_params' and finally to 'json.dumps' in 'build'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or external network interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code maintains a list of sorting parameters, allowing for chaining with 'sort' method. The 'build' method serializes the list to JSON unless raw is specified. There are no security-sensitive operations, external calls, or data leaks. It appears to be a utility class for parameter management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility for managing sorting parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
