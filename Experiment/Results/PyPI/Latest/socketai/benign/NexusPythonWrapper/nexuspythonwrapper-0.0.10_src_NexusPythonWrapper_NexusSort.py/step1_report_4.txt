  "purpose": "A class for managing and building a list of sorting parameters, with the ability to output the parameters as JSON.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is internal or passed via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() converts internal data to JSON string, but it is used on controlled data (self._sort_params) with no untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Method 'sort' appends data to internal list, 'build' serializes this list to JSON, '__str__' calls 'build' to produce string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of 'Self' from typing is correct in Python 3.11+.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to store sorting parameters and serialize them. No external input, no unsafe code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The only operation is appending to a list and serializing it. No malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for configuring sort parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility class for managing sorting parameters and serializing them to JSON. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
