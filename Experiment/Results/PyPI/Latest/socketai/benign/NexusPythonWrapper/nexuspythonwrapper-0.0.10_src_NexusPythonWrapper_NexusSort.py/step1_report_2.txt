{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for building and managing a list of sorting parameters, which can be serialized to JSON.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters 'field' and 'ascending' within the 'sort' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'build' method outputs the internal '_sort_params' list as a JSON string; potential sink is 'json.dumps'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs ('field', 'ascending') to '_sort_params', and then to output via 'json.dumps' in 'build'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of 'json.dumps' is standard; no unsafe dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a simple builder pattern for sorting parameters, storing them in a list and providing JSON serialization. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected. No external data sources or sinks indicating data exfiltration or malicious actions. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for sorting configurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility class for managing sorting parameters with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
