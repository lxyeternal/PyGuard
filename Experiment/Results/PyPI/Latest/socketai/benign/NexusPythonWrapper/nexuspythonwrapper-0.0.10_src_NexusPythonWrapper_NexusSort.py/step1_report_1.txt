{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for constructing and representing sorting parameters as a list or JSON string.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are used; methods receive parameters directly.",
  "sinks": "The build() method outputs JSON-serialized data, which could be used externally.",
  "flows": "The sort() method modifies internal state based on parameters; build() serializes this state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The class maintains a list of sorting parameters with methods to add new parameters and output them as JSON or list. The usage of 'Self' for return type hints is correct in Python 3.11+. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for constructing sorting options.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a utility to build and represent sorting parameters. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
