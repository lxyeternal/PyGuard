  "purpose": "Manage and serialize sorting parameters for data ordering.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'field' and 'ascending' in 'sort()' method, internal '_sort_params' list.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization output in 'build()' method, returned string from '__str__()'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> append to '_sort_params' -> serialize via 'json.dumps' -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data management with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'NexusSort' that accumulates sorting parameters ('field' and 'ascending') via 'sort()'. It stores these in '_sort_params' and can serialize this list into JSON or return it as a list. The use of 'Self' as a return type hint is valid in Python 3.11+. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, benign, and serves as a configuration utility. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The serialization is controlled and safe. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for managing sorting parameters with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The slight mention of 0.1 in some reports is an overestimation; the risk should be set to zero. Overall, the supply chain security risk from this code is negligible.",
