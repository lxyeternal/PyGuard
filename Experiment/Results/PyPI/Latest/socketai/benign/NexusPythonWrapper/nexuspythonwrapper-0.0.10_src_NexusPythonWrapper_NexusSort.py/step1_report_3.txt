{
  "purpose": "A utility class for managing and building a list of sorting parameters, primarily for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters such as 'field', 'ascending', and 'raw' in the 'sort' and 'build' methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'build' method outputs JSON-formatted string or list of dictionaries, which could potentially expose internal data if misused, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('field', 'ascending', 'raw') flow into internal data structures and are ultimately returned as JSON or list, with no external data flow or untrusted source handling beyond method inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs straightforward data structure management and serialization without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'NexusSort' that maintains a list of sorting parameters. Methods allow appending sort criteria ('sort') and outputting the data as JSON or list ('build'). No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are involved. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present. The usage of 'Self' as a type hint is valid in Python 3.11+, but not a security concern. Overall, this is standard configuration code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility class for managing sorting parameters. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use.",
