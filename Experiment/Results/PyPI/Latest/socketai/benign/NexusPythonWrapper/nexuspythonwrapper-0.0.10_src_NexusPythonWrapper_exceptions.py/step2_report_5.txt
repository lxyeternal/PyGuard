  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes: `NexusError`, `AuthenticationError`, and `CredentialsError`.\n- All classes are simple, inherit from `Exception` or each other, and contain no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or complex behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no data input, output, or processing. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly conclude that the code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n  \n  These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no data flow, no external inputs/outputs, and no suspicious constructs, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at **0** because there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is correctly at **0** because the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No report suggests any assumptions about hidden malicious behavior; all agree the code is benign.\n- The structure is standard for error handling in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is straightforward, safe, and does not pose any security threats. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- The overall risk assessment remains very low, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**This analysis confirms the code is safe and free of malicious intent.**",
