  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Nexus-related application.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading mechanisms are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from each other, forming an exception hierarchy. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious logic. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python error handling. No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, establishing custom exceptions for application error handling. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious intent.",
