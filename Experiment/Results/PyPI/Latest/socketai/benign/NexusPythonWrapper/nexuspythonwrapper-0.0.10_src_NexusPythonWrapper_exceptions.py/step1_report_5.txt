{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a Nexus-related application",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class definitions do not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no handling or processing of untrusted data occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are simple inheritance structures with no dynamic or data flow operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. It establishes a hierarchy for handling specific Nexus errors, Authentication errors, and Credentials errors. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no suspicious activity present. The code is straightforward, with clear class inheritance, and does not contain any signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic class definition for custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is simple, clear, and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
