  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and each other, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only establishes class hierarchies without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception or each other. There are no dynamic behaviors, data handling, or external interactions. The code is standard for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The structure is clear, and the purpose is purely structural. No issues or suspicious features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
