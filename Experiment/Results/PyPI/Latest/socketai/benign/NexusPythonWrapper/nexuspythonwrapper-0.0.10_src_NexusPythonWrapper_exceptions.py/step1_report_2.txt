  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Nexus operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; these are class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NexusError as a base class, with AuthenticationError and CredentialsError inheriting from it. There is no data input, external interaction, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be part of a larger application for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains simple, standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks identified.",
