  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Nexus, authentication, and credentials.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definitions do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data; classes are purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; simple class inheritance without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and each other, serving as error types for a larger application. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no code that could be malicious. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It is safe and standard for error handling.",
