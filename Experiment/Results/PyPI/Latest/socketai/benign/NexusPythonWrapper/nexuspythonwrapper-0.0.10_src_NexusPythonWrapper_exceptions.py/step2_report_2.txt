  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data input/output, processing, or suspicious constructs. The logic is straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the described class definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent, as the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** None. The class hierarchy is standard and correct.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: All assign 0, consistent with the code.\n  - SecurityRisk: All assign 0, justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no issues or inconsistencies are evident.\n- The purpose is purely to define exception classes, with no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay at 0, given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If these exception classes are integrated into a larger application, their security impact is minimal.\n- No further action needed unless future code introduces suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
