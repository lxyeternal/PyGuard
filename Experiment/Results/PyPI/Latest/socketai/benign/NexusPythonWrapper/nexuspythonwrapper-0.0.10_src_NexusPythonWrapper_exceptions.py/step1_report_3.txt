  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow since no input or output or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. No malicious code, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The structure is standard for Python error handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
