  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in all reports is identical: simple class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Exception or each other.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for error handling in Python.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- The code does not perform any data handling, network communication, or dynamic execution.\n- No suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The exception hierarchy is clear and typical for application error categorization.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct; code is transparent.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct; no malicious behavior or intent detected.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct; the code poses no security risk, as it is purely structural.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- Since all reports are identical in content and reasoning, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The confidence scores are appropriately set to 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n- No further action or re-scoring needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious, straightforward exception class hierarchy with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
