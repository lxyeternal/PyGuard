  "purpose": "Unit testing the NexusWrapper class for authentication configuration using environment variables.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() loads environment variables; os.getenv() reads 'URI', 'APIKEY', 'NEXUSUSERNAME', 'PASSWORD'.",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flows to untrusted sinks like network, file, or external systems).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded and then passed directly into NexusWrapper constructor; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that loads environment variables for credentials and tests the NexusWrapper's authentication types. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The environment variables are used to supply credentials securely at runtime, not hardcoded. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware patterns are present. The structure and use of libraries are typical for testing authentication logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign unit test for configuration validation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly loads sensitive data via environment variables and tests different authentication modes.",
