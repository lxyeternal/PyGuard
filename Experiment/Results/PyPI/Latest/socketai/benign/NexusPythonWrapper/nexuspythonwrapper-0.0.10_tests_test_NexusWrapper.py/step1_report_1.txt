  "purpose": "Unit testing NexusWrapper class for different authentication types, loading environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('URI'), os.getenv('APIKEY'), os.getenv('NEXUSUSERNAME'), os.getenv('PASSWORD')",
  "sinks": "NexusWrapper instantiations with credentials, potential sensitive data usage in environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded and used directly in NexusWrapper constructors for authentication",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; use of environment variables for credentials is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code loads credentials from environment variables and uses them to initialize NexusWrapper objects for testing. There are no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs. The code only performs standard unit testing functions. No data is being transmitted externally, nor are there any indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. Use of dotenv for environment variable management is typical and not suspicious. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign test script for the NexusWrapper class, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles environment variables securely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
