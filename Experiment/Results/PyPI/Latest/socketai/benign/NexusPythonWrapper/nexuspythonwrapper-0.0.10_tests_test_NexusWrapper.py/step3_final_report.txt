  "purpose": "Unit tests for the NexusWrapper class, verifying authentication type handling using environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv; instantiation of NexusWrapper with credentials",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects; no network or file operations",
  "flows": "Environment variables as input to NexusWrapper; no malicious data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test script that loads credentials from environment variables and creates NexusWrapper instances with different authentication types. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1). The use of environment variables for secrets is standard and does not introduce malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to environment variable handling, which is standard practice. All reports are consistent and accurate. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
