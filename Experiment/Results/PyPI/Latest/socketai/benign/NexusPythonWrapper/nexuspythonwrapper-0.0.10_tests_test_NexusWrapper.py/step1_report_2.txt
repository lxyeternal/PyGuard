{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for the NexusWrapper class, verifying authentication type handling and environment variable loading.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('URI'), os.getenv('APIKEY'), os.getenv('NEXUSUSERNAME'), os.getenv('PASSWORD')",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks occur; environment variables are loaded but not used in unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded in setUp() and passed as parameters to NexusWrapper instances, with no further data flow leading to security-sensitive actions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed; environment variables are used securely to configure connections",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data from environment variables for testing the NexusWrapper class. It performs standard unit test procedures without executing potentially dangerous code or malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious flows are present. The code only reads environment variables and creates instances of NexusWrapper with these parameters, which by itself is benign. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test script that loads environment variables for configuration and tests authentication types in the NexusWrapper class. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
