  "purpose": "Unit testing the NexusWrapper class for different authentication methods using environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('URI'), os.getenv('APIKEY'), os.getenv('NEXUSUSERNAME'), os.getenv('PASSWORD')",
  "sinks": "NexusWrapper constructor, environment variables used for credentials",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded, then passed directly into NexusWrapper instances for authentication",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is common, but no validation or encryption is performed. No suspicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables using dotenv, then creates instances of NexusWrapper with different authentication parameters, verifying the authentication type. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior detected. No network or data leakage observed. The code appears standard for testing authentication logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test script for an API wrapper, using environment variables for credentials. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is benign and standard for testing purposes.",
