  "purpose": "Unit testing for the NexusWrapper class, focusing on authentication setup and environment variable loading.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('URI', 'APIKEY', 'NEXUSUSERNAME', 'PASSWORD') using dotenv and os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted over the network within this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded at setup; these values are used in NexusWrapper instantiations but are not directly passed to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code appears to securely load secrets from environment variables. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing modules, loads environment variables, and uses them to configure NexusWrapper objects with different authentication types. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. The code properly isolates secrets in environment variables, reducing risk. No network communication or data exfiltration occurs within this test code. The code structure is standard for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic unit testing of an API wrapper with secure handling of credentials via environment variables. No malicious or supply chain security issues are detected. The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
