{
  "purpose": "The code transforms a given English sentence into historical stages of the language, specifically Old English and Middle English, for demonstration or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line argument 'sentence'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data to external systems, write to files, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input (sentence) -> transformation functions -> output (printed historical sentences).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard string manipulation and command-line interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes language replacements for Old and Middle English. It defines methods to transform sentences based on these replacements, handling capitalization and punctuation. The generator yields three versions of the sentence: Old English, Middle English, and the original modern sentence. The command-line interface allows transforming a user-provided or default test sentence, printing the results. No external network access, file operations, or malicious actions are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign educational tool for illustrating language evolution. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply performs string transformations based on predefined dictionaries.",
