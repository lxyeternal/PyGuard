{
  "purpose": "The code transforms a given English sentence into three historical stages of English: Old English, Middle English, and Modern English.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via command-line argument 'sentence' or uses a default test sentence.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input is taken from command line or default sentence, then passed through transformation functions, with no data being sent externally or manipulated insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, and the only data handling is string manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries (argparse and typer) for command-line interface. It defines a class for historical language transformation with hardcoded word mappings, which are used to replace words in input sentences. The process involves splitting sentences, handling punctuation, and case preservation. No external network communication, file I/O, or environment variable usage occurs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and content are transparent, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple string transformations to emulate language evolution and contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility for educational or illustrative purposes.",
