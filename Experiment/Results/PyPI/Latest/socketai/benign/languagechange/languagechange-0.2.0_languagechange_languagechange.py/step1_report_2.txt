{
  "purpose": "The code transforms a given modern English sentence into approximations of Old English and Middle English to demonstrate language evolution.",
  "sources": "Input sentence received via command line argument or default test sentence within the code.",
  "sinks": "Output of the transformed sentences displayed to the user via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input source (command line argument or default) → transformation functions → printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of untrusted inputs in unsafe ways. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (argparse and typer) for CLI functionality. Defines language mappings for Old and Middle English transformations, with a method to transform sentences word-by-word, handling punctuation and capitalization. The generator yields transformed sentences for each language stage. The main command function provides a default test sentence if none is given, and prints the language evolution results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The code strictly processes input data for transformation and display purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign language transformation for demonstration purposes. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or sensitive operations.",
