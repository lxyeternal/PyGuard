{
  "purpose": "The code transforms a given modern English sentence into approximations of Old and Middle English to demonstrate language evolution.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line argument (sentence parameter).",
  "sinks": "Output to console (print statements).",
  "flows": "User provides a sentence -> function processes and transforms the sentence -> results are printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward text processing with no data leaks, external connections, or malicious code injections. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to replace words in a sentence with historical English equivalents, including handling punctuation and capitalization. The process involves simple dictionary lookups and string manipulations. The script uses Typer for CLI argument parsing, with no network operations, file I/O, environment variable usage, or other side effects. The code's primary purpose is educational language transformation, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focused on text processing for educational purposes. It contains no malware, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
