  "purpose": "Transform a modern English sentence into Old and Middle English approximations using static word replacements.",
  "sources": "Input sentence provided via CLI argument or default test sentence.",
  "sinks": "In-memory string output; printed to console.",
  "flows": "Input sentence -> transformation functions -> printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward static word replacements to simulate language evolution, handling punctuation and capitalization appropriately. It uses standard libraries without external dependencies or network activity. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is deterministic and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational utility for linguistic transformation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
