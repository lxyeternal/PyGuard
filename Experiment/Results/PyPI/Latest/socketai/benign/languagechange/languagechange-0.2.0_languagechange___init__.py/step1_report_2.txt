{
  "purpose": "This code exports the LanguageEvolution class for external use, likely as part of a module related to language or evolutionary processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.languagechange), which loads the LanguageEvolution class.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The imported class could be used elsewhere, but within this code, there are no data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of unusual or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines the module's export list. It does not execute any untrusted code or contain any suspicious patterns. The import path is relative, indicating local module usage, which is typical in Python packages. There are no apparent anomalies or security issues in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python module fragment that exposes a class for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
