  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a Python module by importing the 'LanguageEvolution' class from a local module 'languagechange' and exposing it via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'languagechange' and the attribute 'LanguageEvolution' within it.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects; the code only performs imports and defines the module's public API.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely imports a class and sets '__all__' without processing data or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a local module and declares it as part of the public API. It does not include any dynamic execution, data handling, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module declaration with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
