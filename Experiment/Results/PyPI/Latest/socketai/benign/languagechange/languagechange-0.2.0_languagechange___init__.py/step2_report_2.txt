  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate their accuracy and reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module export pattern, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code as provided is a standard Python pattern; no issues are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's purpose and security posture.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity; malware=0 is correct.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not overstate potential vulnerabilities; they are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign module export pattern with no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
