{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, serving as metadata for the package version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and type checking conditional block.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; no external data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version metadata definitions. The TYPE_CHECKING block is a common pattern for type hints and does not process untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns version information and type annotations. The only dynamic parts are static string and tuple assignments, with no data input, external calls, or sensitive operations. The type checking block is typical for type hints and does not execute at runtime unless type checkers are used. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It is a simple, straightforward version definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version metadata module with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a standard version info provider for a Python package and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
