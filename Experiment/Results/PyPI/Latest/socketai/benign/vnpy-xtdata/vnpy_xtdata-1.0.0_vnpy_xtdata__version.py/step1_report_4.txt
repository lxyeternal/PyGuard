  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, without any functional logic beyond setting version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables from hardcoded strings and tuples",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) with static, hardcoded values. It includes a TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints, which is a common pattern. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows involving untrusted sources. The code is solely for version management and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version info definition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally minimal.",
