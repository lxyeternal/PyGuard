  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, including version string, tuple, and related variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded version strings and tuples to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward version information setup with standard practices. The comment indicates it's auto-generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables with hardcoded values for versioning purposes. It includes a type-checking block which does not execute at runtime and simply imports typing constructs. The version information is static and does not process external input, nor does it include any network or file operations. The code appears to be a standard version info module generated by a build tool, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info module, automatically generated, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely defines version variables for package management.",
