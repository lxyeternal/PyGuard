  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info module created by setuptools-scm.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n   - Contains a conditional block for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`) that does not execute at runtime.\n   - No input/output operations, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, and no dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and auto-generated.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or signs of malware.\n   - The version variables are hardcoded, with no external dependencies or data.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as standard version info.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is static and safe.\n   - The type-checking pattern is standard and not suspicious.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The assessments are accurate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk aspects.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version information module with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security risk or malicious threat.",
