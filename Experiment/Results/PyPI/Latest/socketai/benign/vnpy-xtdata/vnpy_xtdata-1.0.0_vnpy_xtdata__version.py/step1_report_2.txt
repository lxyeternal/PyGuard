  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version variables, assigns static version strings and tuples, and includes conditional typing imports. There are no input sources, no data leakage mechanisms, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious logic or external communications. The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools-scm for version tracking, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign auto-generated version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
