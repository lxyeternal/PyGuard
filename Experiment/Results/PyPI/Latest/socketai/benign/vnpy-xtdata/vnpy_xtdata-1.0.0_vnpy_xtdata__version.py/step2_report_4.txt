  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version info module, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n   - It includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` block for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, file operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is auto-generated by setuptools-scm, as indicated by comments.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Evaluation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and standard for version management.\n   - No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it leak information or perform any external operations.\n\n3. **Score Assessment:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims or indications of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any security concerns based on the code content.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard auto-generated version info module.\n   - No anomalies, no malicious intent, no obfuscation.\n   - The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n6. **My Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n   \n   These align with the evidence.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward version information module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No adjustments needed; all scores are appropriate.",
