{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, providing version strings and tuples for package management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples, set directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns static version information and defines type hints for version tuples. It includes a conditional import block for type checking, which is standard practice. No dynamic execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling present. The code appears to be auto-generated for versioning purposes, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define and assign version information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
