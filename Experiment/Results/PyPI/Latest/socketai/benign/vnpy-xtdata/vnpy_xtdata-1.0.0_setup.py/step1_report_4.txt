  "purpose": "Configure versioning scheme for a Python package using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools_scm.version and setuptools, function parameters, and variables within functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() for debugging, which may expose internal version info, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom versioning schemes for setuptools_scm, including a function to modify local version strings and one to determine overall version scheme. The print statement outputs version info, which could expose internal details during execution, but is not malicious. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely manages version formatting with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of print() could leak internal version info but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
