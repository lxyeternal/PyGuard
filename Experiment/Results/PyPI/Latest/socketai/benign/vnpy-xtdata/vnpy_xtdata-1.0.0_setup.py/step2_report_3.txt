  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code imports versioning utilities from `setuptools_scm`.\n- Defines two functions: `custom_local_scheme` and `custom_version_scheme`.\n- Both functions use the `version` object to generate version strings.\n- Notably, `custom_version_scheme` contains a `print(version)` statement.\n- The `setup()` function uses these custom schemes.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code functions as intended for version customization. The only potential concern is the `print()` statement inside `custom_version_scheme`.  \n  **Conclusion:** No security vulnerabilities or malicious code are present. The `print()` is benign but may be considered a minor anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n\n- **The reports** correctly identify that the `print()` statement is unusual but benign.  \n- They note that no secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.  \n- The analysis consistently states that the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Potential oversight:**  \n- The reports mention \"exposing internal version info\" via `print()`. While this isn't malicious, in a security context, leaking version info could be undesirable in some environments.  \n- However, the reports do not overstate this; they treat it as benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No significant logical flaws in the reports. They are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Security Risk | Reasoning |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------|\n| 1-5     | 0               | 0 or 0.1       | The code is benign; no malware, no significant security risk. The minor security risk score (0.1 or 0.2) is justified if considering info leakage via print, but overall very low. |\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.1 or 0.2) due to the print statement potentially leaking version info. This is acceptable but should be minimal.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable. The small security risk score (0.1 or 0.2) reflects minor info leakage, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.  \n- The highest assigned is 0.2, justified by potential info leakage, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.  \n- No malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that the `print()` statement is benign, which is reasonable.  \n- No false positives or unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**\n\n- The scores align well with the analysis: benign code, minor info leakage concern, no malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1-0.2** |\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- Obfuscation is not present.\n- The risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minor info leakage potential.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The `print()` statement should ideally be removed in production code to prevent accidental info leakage.\n- Overall, the code is standard, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with a minor anomaly (print statement) that does not constitute a security risk. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
