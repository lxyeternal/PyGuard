{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom version schemes for a Python package using setuptools_scm to manage versioning based on SCM data.",
  "sources": "Reads SCM version information from the 'version' parameter of functions, and uses 'print' to output version info.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'print' which outputs to stdout; no sinks that leak data externally are present.",
  "flows": "Version object is passed into functions; no untrusted input flows into sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a 'print' statement inside version scheme function, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioning functions from 'setuptools_scm' and defines two custom schemes: one for local versioning, and one for overall versioning. The 'custom_local_scheme' adds a '+git' suffix unless the version is exact. The 'custom_version_scheme' prints the version object and returns either a formatted tag or the next suggested version. The 'print' statement is benign and likely for debugging. No suspicious data handling, external network activity, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard customization of version schemes for packaging, with a benign print statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
