  "purpose": "Define custom version schemes for setuptools_scm and configure package setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools_scm.version and setuptools, and the setup function call.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; setup configuration does not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; version functions manipulate internal version data only.",
  "anomalies": "The print statement within custom_version_scheme could expose internal version info during build but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes versioning schemes for a Python package using setuptools_scm. It defines functions that modify how version strings are generated, based solely on internal version data. The print statement outputs version info but does not affect security. No external input handling or suspicious behavior is observed. No malicious or maliciously intended code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard customization for package versioning without any malicious intent or security risks. The presence of a print statement for debugging purposes does not introduce security concerns but should be removed in production for cleanliness.",
