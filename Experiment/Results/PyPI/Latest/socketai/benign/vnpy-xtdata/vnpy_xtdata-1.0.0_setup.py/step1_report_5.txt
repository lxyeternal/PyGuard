  "purpose": "Configure versioning scheme for a Python package using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools_scm and setuptools; function parameters and attributes related to version information.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources flow into sinks; version object is used internally for version formatting.",
  "anomalies": "The print statement in custom_version_scheme could expose internal version info in logs or stdout, which may be considered unintended info leakage but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. The code dynamically determines version strings, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to customize version formatting based on SCM data. The print statement outputs version info, which could be viewed as an information leak if logs are exposed, but it does not constitute malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or harmful network activity are present. The code relies on external version data and formats it accordingly. No user input handling or unsafe code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for version management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the print statement, which could leak internal version details, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe.",
