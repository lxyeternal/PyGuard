  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily for customizing version schemes using `setuptools_scm`.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the presence of `print()` statements within the version scheme functions, which are generally used for debugging purposes.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network calls, or any other malicious activities.\n\n2. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code as provided matches the description in the reports.\n   - The functions `custom_local_scheme` and `custom_version_scheme` manipulate version data as intended.\n   - The `print()` statements are benign and do not impact security directly, although they could leak internal version info if logs are exposed.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the `print()` statements are not malicious but could be considered extraneous or for debugging.\n   - The reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are mostly low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting that the only concern is potential information leakage via `print()`.\n\n4. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given that the only issue is an extraneous print statement that could leak info, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements or Changes:**\n   - The `print()` statements should be removed or replaced with proper logging at appropriate levels (e.g., debug) to avoid unintended info leakage.\n   - No change needed in scores based on the current analysis.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is standard for customizing version schemes.\n   - No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The only minor concern is the debug print statements, which are benign but should be cleaned up in production.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0.2 if you consider info leakage minor, but 0.1 seems sufficient)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential info leakage via print statements, but not a serious risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with only a debug print statement that could be improved for production. The current scores reflect this accurately.",
