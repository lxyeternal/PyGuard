{
  "purpose": "Configure package versioning using setuptools_scm with custom schemes.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools_scm.version and setuptools, and the functions custom_local_scheme and custom_version_scheme that process version information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, code execution, or other security effects.",
  "flows": "The version object is processed in custom_local_scheme and custom_version_scheme functions, then passed to setup() as configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The print statement in custom_version_scheme could be considered unusual but not malicious. The functions manipulate version data without any external or harmful side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version management utilities and defines two functions to customize version schemes based on the version object. The custom_local_scheme function appends Git commit information conditionally; custom_version_scheme formats the version string or guesses the next version. The setup() call integrates these custom schemes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. The print statement could be considered extraneous but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for package versioning with custom schemes. It does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the debug print statement, which is benign and not suspicious.",
