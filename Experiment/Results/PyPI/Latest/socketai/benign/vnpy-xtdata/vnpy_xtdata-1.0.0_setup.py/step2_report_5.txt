  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports identify the presence of a `print()` statement inside the `custom_version_scheme` function.\n- The `print()` outputs version information, which could potentially expose internal build details.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present.\n- The code manipulates internal version data for packaging purposes, which is standard practice.\n- The reports consistently rate the security risk as very low (0 or 0.1–0.2), and malware as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The `print()` statement is benign but could be considered an unintended information leak if logs are exposed.\n- No actual vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The main flaw is the use of `print()` within a version scheme function, which is unconventional for production code. It is likely a debugging leftover.\n- This could be improved by removing or replacing the print with proper logging at an appropriate level (e.g., debug).\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to potential info leakage via print statements. However, this is not a security vulnerability per se.\n- **Overall Risk:** Very low, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no overestimation or underestimation is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor concern about information leakage via print statements, but not a security threat.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The print statement could leak internal version info if logs are publicly accessible, but this is a common debugging artifact and not malicious.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform any external communication or data exfiltration.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Remove or replace `print()` with proper logging at debug level before deploying to production.\n- Ensure logs are protected if version info should not be exposed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard setup customization with a benign debugging print statement. There are no security or malware concerns. The minimal risk score reflects the potential for information leakage but does not indicate a security vulnerability.\n\n**Final scores I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the overall benign nature of the code.",
