  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step to determine the actual security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports versioning utilities from `setuptools_scm`.\n- Defines `custom_local_scheme` to append `+git.<node>` unless the version is exact.\n- Defines `custom_version_scheme` which prints the version object and returns either a formatted tag or the next version.\n- Calls `setup()` with these custom schemes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code functions as intended for version customization.\n- The `print` statement inside `custom_version_scheme` outputs version info during build or install processes.\n\n### Security implications:\n- The `print` statement could expose internal version details in build logs or stdout, which might be considered information leakage.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or malicious code are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The print statement is benign but could be considered a minor security concern if internal version info should be kept private.\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies the benign nature of the code and the print statement.\n- Assigns malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar conclusion; notes the print statement as benign, possibly for debugging.\n- Assigns malware 0, security risk 0.1.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, though the security risk could be slightly higher if internal info leakage is a concern. But since no malicious intent is claimed, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same reasoning; print is benign, no malicious code.\n- Security risk 0, but notes potential info leakage.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same conclusions; print may leak info but is not malicious.\n- Security risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar; print could leak info, no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased from 0 to 0.1 or 0.2 to reflect that the print statement could leak internal version info, which might be undesirable in certain secure environments.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to info leakage potential from print statements)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard versioning customization with a benign print statement. While it could leak internal version info, this is not malicious or maliciously intended. The current scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in security risk score to 0.1 could better reflect the potential info leakage concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed no malicious code.  \n- The print statement is benign but could leak internal info.  \n- Scores should stay at malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.  \n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAdjust the security risk score to **0.1** to acknowledge the minor info leakage risk.",
