  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or data transmission points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only imports and defines exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The comment annotations are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package __init__.py file that imports classes and functions from local modules and declares exports. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. It simply sets up module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not read input, handle sensitive data, or perform any suspicious operations.",
