{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package initializer (__init__.py) that imports and exposes classes/functions from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from .xt_datapub and .xt_datafeed modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and re-exports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer, importing specific classes and functions and defining __all__ for public API. It contains no user input, network activity, or data processing. Comments are benign metadata. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and transparency support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The high confidence (1) is justified given the code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free from malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
