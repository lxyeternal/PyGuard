  "purpose": "The code serves as an initializer for a Python package, exporting classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .xt_datapub and .xt_datafeed",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for explicit export. It contains no user input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The file is purely declarative, configuring module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes exports for the package.",
