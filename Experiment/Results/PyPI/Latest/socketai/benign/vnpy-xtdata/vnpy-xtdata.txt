      "conclusion": "The code is a standard versioning customization script with a benign debug print statement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is the potential leakage of internal version info via the print statement, which is not a security threat but should be cleaned up for production. The assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to external dependencies and credential management, which are common in such systems."
