{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python module that adds colors to terminal text",
  "sources": "Reading long_description from 'README.md', setting package metadata (name, version, author, url, classifiers, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no execution or network activity present",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from package parameters to setup() function; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration parameters. It reads the long description from a local file, which is a common and benign practice. There are no code execution, network connections, or dynamic behaviors. No input validation or unsafe code practices are observed. The content is consistent with typical package setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely provides package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
