  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No reports identify any dynamic input, external data sources, or code execution.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is straightforward, with static metadata and standard setuptools usage.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n- Commented-out fields are typical placeholders and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No external data, network activity, or input handling is present.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Given the code's benign nature, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues found with the code or the reports' reasoning.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified; no need to adjust scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard setup.py script with no signs of malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
