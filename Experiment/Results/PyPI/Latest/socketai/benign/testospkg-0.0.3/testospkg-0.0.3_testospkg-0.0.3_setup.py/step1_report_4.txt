  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python package named 'testospkg'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools (setup, find_packages), and data within the setup() call (package name, version, description, classifiers, python_requires).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink as no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It imports necessary functions from setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no indications of data input/output, malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All elements are standard for project distribution, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-formed configuration.",
