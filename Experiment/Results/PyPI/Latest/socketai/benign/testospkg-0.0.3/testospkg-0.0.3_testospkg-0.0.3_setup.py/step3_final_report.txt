  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and discover packages.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields and find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, no dynamic code, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or higher risk scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
