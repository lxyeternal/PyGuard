  "purpose": "Import the 'say_hello' function from the local 'hello' module, likely for greeting or user interaction purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'hello' module from the current package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a local import statement exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import without additional logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function 'say_hello' from a relative module 'hello'. The import is straightforward and does not involve any dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues in this minimal snippet. Since it is only an import statement, the overall risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple import operation with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
