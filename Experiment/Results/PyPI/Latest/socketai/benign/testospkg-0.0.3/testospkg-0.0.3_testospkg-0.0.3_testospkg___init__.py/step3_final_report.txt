{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the function 'say_hello' from a local module 'hello'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'hello' module in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports a function without further data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; it is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python import statement importing 'say_hello' from a local module 'hello'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import is a common pattern in Python projects, and no external communication, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The confidence in this assessment is high, and the malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and standard usage.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
