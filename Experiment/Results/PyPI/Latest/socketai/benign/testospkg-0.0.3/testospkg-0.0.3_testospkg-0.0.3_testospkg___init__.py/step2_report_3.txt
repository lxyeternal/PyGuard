  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement: `from .hello import say_hello`.\n- None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code is present as specified.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- The logic and reasoning in the reports are consistent and sound.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are reasonable and justified based on the code snippet.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports are uniform and agree on benignity, there's no indication of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is justified given the straightforward import statement.\n- The risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores or assessments.\n- Given the minimal code and the lack of any suspicious activity, the overall risk remains negligible.\n- If future context reveals dynamic imports, code execution, or external communication, reassessment would be necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that this code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious attributes.",
