  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Presence of issues?** No. The code is a straightforward import statement.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores?** Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Justification for scores?** Since the code only imports a local function with no suspicious behavior, scores are appropriate.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Presence of issues?** No. Again, a simple import.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis correctly states the benign nature.\n   - **Scores?** All zeros, which are appropriate.\n   - **Justification?** The report's conclusion aligns with the code snippet.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Presence of issues?** No. The import is straightforward.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The report correctly notes the lack of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores?** All zeros, which are appropriate.\n   - **Justification?** No malicious indicators are present.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Presence of issues?** No. The import is standard.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis is consistent.\n   - **Scores?** All zeros, matching the benign assessment.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Presence of issues?** No. The code is just an import.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** None.\n   - **Scores?** All zeros, appropriate for such a minimal import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present in these snippets.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Given the uniformity and simplicity of the code, I would agree with the current scores.\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If in a broader context, the surrounding code or package behavior were examined, further analysis might be warranted.\n- For this isolated snippet, the current assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns based on the provided snippets.",
