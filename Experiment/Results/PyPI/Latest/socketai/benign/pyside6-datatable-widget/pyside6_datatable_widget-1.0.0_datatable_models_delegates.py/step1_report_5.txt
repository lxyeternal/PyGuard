{
  "purpose": "Define custom delegate classes for editing various data types in a Qt table view.",
  "sources": "Imports from PySide6.QtCore and PySide6.QtWidgets; class initializations and methods accessing model data",
  "sinks": "model.setData calls, createEditor methods, potential displayText formatting",
  "flows": "Data read from model via index.model().data; data passed to editors; edited data set back via model.setData",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to implement standard UI delegates for data editing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides UI components for editing data in a PyQt/PySide6 application. It includes classes for numeric, date, boolean, line, and text data types, with methods for creating editors, setting editor data, and updating models. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are present. All class and method implementations follow typical patterns for such UI delegates, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of UI delegate classes for data editing in a PySide6 application, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe.",
