{
  "purpose": "Manage and interact with UI widgets within a controller context, providing methods to get, set, and temporarily suppress signals on widgets.",
  "sources": "Controller object passed during initialization; widget names used in get, set, and do_action_suppress_signal methods.",
  "sinks": "get method accesses nested widget attributes; set method assigns values to controller attributes; do_action_suppress_signal calls widget.blockSignals and executes a closure.",
  "flows": "Input widget name flows through get to retrieve widget object; set uses name to assign value to controller attribute; do_action_suppress_signal retrieves widget and executes closure with signals blocked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages UI widget references and manipulates widget states within a controller class. It uses standard attribute access and method calls. No external data inputs, network activity, or sensitive data handling identified. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code detected. Methods perform typical widget management tasks. No signs of backdoors, malicious data leaks, or sabotage. The code is straightforward and aligns with common UI management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard widget management utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It manages UI components and their states in a typical manner, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
