  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages widgets, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. It performs attribute lookups, nested widget access, and config storage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems reasonable, considering potential misuses if inputs are untrusted, but overall, the code is benign.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on UI widget management, no malicious behavior, standard reflection usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The securityRisk score is appropriate; the code is benign.\n- The confidence is slightly below 1, which is reasonable given the general nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages widgets, no malicious activity, standard attribute handling, signals management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n- SecurityRisk=0 is justified.\n- The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with attention to validation and exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs validation, raising exceptions on invalid inputs.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- SecurityRisk=0.2 is acceptable, given the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but overall safe.\n- Confidence is high but not perfect, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages widgets with safe attribute access, no external data, malicious activity unlikely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- SecurityRisk=0 is justified.\n- The confidence level is high.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied, mostly low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature—potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low; the only concern is potential misuse if inputs are untrusted)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard widget management utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1), acknowledging potential misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the assessments are well-founded.",
