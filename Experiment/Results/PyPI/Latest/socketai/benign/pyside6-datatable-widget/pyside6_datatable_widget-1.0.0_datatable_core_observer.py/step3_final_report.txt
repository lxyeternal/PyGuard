  "purpose": "Implementation of an observer pattern with dynamic event subscription and signal connection, facilitating event-driven communication between components.",
  "sources": "Signal handlers connected via 'connect' method; event names and data passed to 'notify' and 'update' methods.",
  "sinks": "Subscriber 'update' methods invoked with event data; dynamic method calls based on event names.",
  "flows": "Signals -> connect lambda -> notify -> subscriber.update -> on_{event} methods",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic method invocation with 'inspect.signature' and lambda-based signal connections; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard observer pattern with singleton publisher and subscriber classes. Dynamic method invocation allows flexible event handling but could be exploited if event names or data are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'inspect.signature' to determine method parameters is common in such patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, acknowledging potential misuse if external data is maliciously crafted. Overall, the code is a typical, well-structured event system with minimal security concern, provided proper validation of event data and subscriber methods in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an observer pattern with dynamic invocation. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary risk stems from potential misuse if untrusted data or malicious subscribers are involved, but this is inherent to dynamic event handling and not indicative of malicious intent. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
