{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module interface, importing and exposing specific classes and functions for external use, with no malicious or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.observer and .widget_manager), which are read during module initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the ASCII art is decorative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module with import statements and an __all__ declaration. The ASCII art header is purely decorative. The imported modules are local, and the code does not perform any operations beyond defining exports. The reports provided are empty responses with no analysis or findings, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code appears benign, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code snippet and the absence of any substantive report content, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is benign, and the reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
