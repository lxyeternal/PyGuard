{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be defining and exporting components for a data table UI module, including models and delegates for handling data types and user interactions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (.datatable_model and .delegates) which are likely local package modules within the same project.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs. No network or external system interaction is present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The comments contain elaborate ASCII art and decorative headers, but nothing suspicious. The import and export statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for public API. No data processing, user input handling, or external system interaction is present. The code structure is typical for a Python package module. No obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The comments appear to be stylistic and do not affect functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module defining exports for a data table component. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
