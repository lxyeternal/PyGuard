{
  "purpose": "To define and export a set of data table-related classes and constants for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .datatable_model and .delegates",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Import statements provide classes and constants for internal use; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; comments include a decorative header with potential copyright info",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. It imports specific classes and constants from relative modules, indicating modular design. The comments at the top contain ASCII art and metadata but do not execute any logic or perform any actions that could be malicious. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or credential handling. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with import/export statements and benign comments. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
