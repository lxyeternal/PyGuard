  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports classes and constants from local modules and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- They note the ASCII art and comments are purely decorative, with no influence on code execution.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or system commands are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code does not process user input, handle data from untrusted sources, or perform any system/network operations.\n   - The ASCII art and comments are decorative, not malicious.\n   - The import statements are standard and do not introduce risks.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code's purpose and structure.\n   - They accurately dismiss the ASCII art as non-influential.\n   - No flawed logic or reasoning is evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very low.\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious and non-obfuscated.\n   - **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - ASCII art and comments are harmless.\n   - **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal, non-security-related concerns like ASCII art comments)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis code is safe, with no security risks.",
