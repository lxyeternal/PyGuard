{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export classes and constants related to a data table model, likely for use in a GUI or data processing context.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.datatable_model' and '.delegates' which are not detailed here.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The module imports classes and then exposes them via __all__, enabling external code to instantiate or utilize these classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present. The ASCII art and comments are purely aesthetic and do not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and constants from relative modules and then exports them via __all__ for external use. The presence of ASCII art and licensing comments is typical and does not pose security concerns. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data handling operations within this snippet. As it relies on other modules, security assessment would require reviewing those modules, but this file itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an interface for other modules to use imported classes and constants. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected based solely on this code.",
