  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports classes and constants from local modules and exports them via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- ASCII art and comments are purely decorative and do not influence behavior.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: import statements and an `__all__` list.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - ASCII art and comments are non-executable and purely aesthetic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Malware scores are all zero or near zero, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The reports' high confidence scores are justified.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Given the analysis, the risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to zero.\n   - Malware scores should be 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - Obfuscated scores should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The assessments are cautious and justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the content and analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign module initializer or exporter.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores given are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
