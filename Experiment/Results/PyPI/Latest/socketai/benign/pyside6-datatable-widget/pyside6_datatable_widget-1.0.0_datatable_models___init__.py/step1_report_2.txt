{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that exports specific classes and enums related to a data table implementation, likely for a GUI or data processing application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .datatable_model and .delegates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports and exports classes and enums without executing untrusted data or performing IO operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The ASCII art and comments are decorative and do not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and declares an __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or untrusted inputs involved. The presence of ASCII art and comments does not impact security. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that imports and exports classes and enums related to a data table. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present based on the provided content.",
