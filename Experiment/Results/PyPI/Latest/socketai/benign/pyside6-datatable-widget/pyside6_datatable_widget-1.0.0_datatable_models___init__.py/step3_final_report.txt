{
  "purpose": "This module defines and exports classes and enums related to data table modeling, serving as an initializer or interface for a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.datatable_model and .delegates).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "Importing classes/enums from local modules and exporting them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art and comments; no executable or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing specific classes and enums, and defining __all__ for exports. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. ASCII art and comments are purely aesthetic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are detected. The structure is typical of a Python package's __init__.py or similar module initializer, with benign content. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and no changes are necessary.",
