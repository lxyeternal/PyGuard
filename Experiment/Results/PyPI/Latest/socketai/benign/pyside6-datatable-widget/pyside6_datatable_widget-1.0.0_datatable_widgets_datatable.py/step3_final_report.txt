{
  "purpose": "A GUI component for displaying and interacting with tabular data, supporting sorting, filtering, pagination, and column visibility toggling.",
  "sources": "User interactions via search input, pagination controls, column visibility buttons, and data fed through setData/setModel methods.",
  "sinks": "Filtering functions (setSearchTerm/setFilterFixedString) affecting the view; signals propagating user actions; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger filtering and pagination updates; signals propagate changes; data flows within the model-view architecture without external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and comments; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard PySide6 Qt model-view patterns, with typical filtering, sorting, and pagination logic. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is evident. Filtering functions are standard and do not introduce security risks. ASCII art and comments are benign stylistic choices. The scores reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to standard filtering mechanisms that could be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GUI component for data presentation and interaction, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
