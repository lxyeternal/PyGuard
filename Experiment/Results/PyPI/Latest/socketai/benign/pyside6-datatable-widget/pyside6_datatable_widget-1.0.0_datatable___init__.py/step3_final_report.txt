{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports UI component classes and constants related to a DataTable widget, serving as a module for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.widgets.datatable, .models.datatable_model, .models.delegates). No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process user input, network data, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import and export of classes and constants within the module; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only stylistic anomaly is the ASCII art header and a future copyright date (2025), which are decorative and do not influence code execution or security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and constants, defines version and export metadata, and contains stylistic comments. There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network calls, or obfuscated code. The ASCII art and future date are purely decorative. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module with no security risks or malicious intent. The decorative ASCII art and future date do not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
