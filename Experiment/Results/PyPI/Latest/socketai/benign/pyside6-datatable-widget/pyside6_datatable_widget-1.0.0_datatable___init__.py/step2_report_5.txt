  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a Python module that imports several classes and constants related to data table components, models, and delegates.\n- It defines module metadata (__version__, __all__).\n- The header contains ASCII art and stylistic comments, including a future date (2025).\n- There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, network operations, or handling of untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative, not affecting security.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code.\n- The ASCII art and comments, while stylistic, do not impact security but could be considered unprofessional or misleading in some contexts.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher risk score since the code is static, imports only local modules, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The ASCII art with a future date (2025) might be viewed as suspicious or as a sign of mock-up code, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n- No external data or user input is processed, reducing attack surface.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment, with no contradictions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a benign, standard Python module for exposing UI components, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe module with no security concerns. The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative and do not influence security. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further security action needed.",
