{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports various classes and constants related to data tables and delegates, and specifies module metadata such as version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and constants from relative modules: .widgets.datatable, .models.datatable_model, and .models.delegates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or code that process untrusted input, nor any network or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes and setting module metadata, with no data processing or external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative and do not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and metadata definition, with no runtime logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The import statements and metadata are standard and do not introduce security risks. The comments are decorative ASCII art and licensing information, not executable code. There are no suspicious patterns, no dynamic evaluation, and no external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module setup with no signs of malware or security issues.",
