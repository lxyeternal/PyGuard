{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export various components related to a DataTable UI widget, including models and delegates, for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources or data reading points are present in the code; it primarily imports modules and sets module metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O operations, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes components for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The header comment contains ASCII art and non-technical stylistic comments that are unrelated to functionality but do not impact security. The code itself is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to data table components and defines module metadata such as version and exported symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, user input handling, or network operations. The structure is clean and typical for a Python module meant to package components for reuse. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module that exports UI components related to data tables. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The header comment is stylistic and does not influence security.",
