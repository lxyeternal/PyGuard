  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports local components and defines module metadata (`__version__`, `__all__`).\n- The header comment contains ASCII art and stylistic comments, which are purely decorative and do not influence execution.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or external data processing is present.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The ASCII art includes a future copyright date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The core logic is simply import statements and metadata.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No, the reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and free of security issues.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**ASCII Art & Future Date:**\n- The ASCII art and comments are stylistic, not functional.\n- The future copyright date (2025) is likely a placeholder or stylistic choice, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential for False Positives:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The only note is that the ASCII art and future date are unusual but benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, well-structured Python module exporting UI components with no malicious or security concerns. The ASCII art and comments are decorative and do not affect security. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
