{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package module, importing classes and constants related to data tables and models, likely for a GUI or data processing application.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .widgets.datatable, .models.datatable_model, .models.delegates",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being written to external systems, network, or file based on this code",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines __all__ and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "The header contains ASCII art with stylized comments, including a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, possibly suspicious or a form of obfuscation or joke. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python import statements and module-level metadata, including version and __all__ export list. The ASCII art header is purely decorative. No input reading, data processing, or potentially malicious behavior observed. No code execution or network activity is present. The future copyright date might be an anomaly or a sign of mock-up code, but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The only unusual aspect is the ASCII art header with a future copyright date, which does not impact security.",
