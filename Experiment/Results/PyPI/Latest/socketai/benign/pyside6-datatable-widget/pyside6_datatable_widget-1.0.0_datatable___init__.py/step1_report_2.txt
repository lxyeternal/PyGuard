{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports classes and functions related to data table handling and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .widgets.datatable, .models.datatable_model, .models.delegates",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static imports and metadata definitions",
  "anomalies": "Presence of stylized ASCII art and extensive comments that seem to serve aesthetic or branding purposes; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and constants from local modules within the package, defines a version string, and exports a list of symbols. The ASCII art and copyright comments do not influence execution. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious patterns are observed. All imported modules appear to be local, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a straightforward package component with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles static imports and metadata. The content is consistent with a normal, benign Python package module.",
