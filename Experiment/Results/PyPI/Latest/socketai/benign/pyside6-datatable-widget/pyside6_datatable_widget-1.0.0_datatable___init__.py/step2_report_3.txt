  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports local components related to a DataTable UI widget and defines metadata (__version__, __all__).\n- The header contains ASCII art and stylistic comments, which are non-functional and purely decorative.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or external data processing are present.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code matches the descriptions: straightforward imports, metadata, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **ASCII art and comments:**  \n  They are stylistic, not malicious. The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a mock-up or placeholder, but not security-related.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent:**  \n  No evidence. The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations.\n\n- **Obfuscation or hidden malicious code:**  \n  None detected. The code is transparent and standard.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  All reports assign a risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The only point of minor concern is the future copyright year, but this is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative. The module does not process data or interact externally. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. No changes needed. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
