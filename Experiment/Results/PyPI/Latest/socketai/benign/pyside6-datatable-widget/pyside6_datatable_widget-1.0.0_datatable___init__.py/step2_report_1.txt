  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports specific classes and constants from local modules and defines `__version__` and `__all__`.\n- The header contains ASCII art and stylistic comments, including a future copyright date (2025).\n- There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n- The code appears to be a standard package component for a GUI or data processing application.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; the code is for defining and exporting UI components.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assigned.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; straightforward package component.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar; notes the ASCII art and future copyright date.\n- **Findings:** ASCII art and comments are purely decorative; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Note:** The future date (2025) is unusual but not malicious; possibly a mock-up or stylistic choice.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent; standard import and export module.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected. The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative, not obfuscated or malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk score should be very low or zero.\n- **Malware Score:** Zero, as there is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Future Date (2025):** Slightly unusual but not malicious; possibly a stylistic or mock-up element.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- All reports assign a malware and risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Based on the code and the reports, my assessment is:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a benign, standard module with no suspicious patterns, no dynamic or external activity, and no obfuscation. The ASCII art and future date are stylistic and do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\n**All evidence points to this being a safe, benign module with no security concerns.**",
