  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin-like architecture with dynamic module loading, which introduces supply chain risks but does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for module path manipulation leading to malicious code execution. No active malicious behavior is detected. The overall security posture depends on environment controls and module source trustworthiness."
