  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pyside6-datatable-widget'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, setup() function parameters including metadata and dependencies.",
  "kills": "No untrusted data input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of stylized ASCII art and branding comments, but no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It reads a local README file for description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. There are no network calls, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical Python setup configuration for packaging a library. There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The ASCII art and comments are purely decorative. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
