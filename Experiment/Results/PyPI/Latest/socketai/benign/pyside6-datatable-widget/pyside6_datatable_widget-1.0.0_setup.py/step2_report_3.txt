  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- Reads 'README.md' for long description.\n- Uses `setuptools` to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.\n- Contains ASCII art and comments, but these are purely decorative.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, user input, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The only \"anomalies\" noted are ASCII art and comments, which are non-functional and purely aesthetic.\n- No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- The `malware` score is consistently 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; there's no malware.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified; no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** of 0 is justified; no security issues.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The ASCII art and comments do not influence security or functionality.\n- The code is a typical setup script with no hidden or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, well-formed `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is safe, standard, and contains no security risks. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
