  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) used for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "ASCII art and comments are purely decorative; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup procedures with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated/malicious patterns. ASCII art and comments are benign and do not influence execution. All signals indicate a benign, standard packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
