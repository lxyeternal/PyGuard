{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup instructions for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'pyside6-datatable-widget'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and the setup() function call for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is fed into untrusted sources or output that can be exploited.",
  "flows": "The file reads 'README.md' content to a variable, then uses that variable in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with standard package parameters. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. The comments at the top are decorative ASCII art and licensing information, with no embedded code or hidden instructions. The install_requires specifies a dependency on PySide6. Overall, this is a typical setup.py script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
