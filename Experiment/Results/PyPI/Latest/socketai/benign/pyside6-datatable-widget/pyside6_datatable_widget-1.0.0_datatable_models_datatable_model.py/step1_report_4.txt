{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom data table model for use in a Qt application, handling data representation, formatting, sorting, filtering, and row collapsing functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the '_data' list of dictionaries; column setup via 'setData' and 'setColumns'; data formatting and search functions are configured through dedicated setter methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; data is primarily used for display and internal manipulation within the application, with no network or file I/O activities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input source '_data' into the 'data()' method for display; user modifications invoke 'setData' which updates internal data; search and aggregation functions process this data internally without external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments; the code primarily handles data management and display logic without external system interactions or obfuscated code; no indications of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Qt model for data display with additional features such as formatting, sorting, searching, filtering, and row collapsing. It includes multiple setup functions for column configuration and default behaviors based on data types. No network access, system modification, or external data exfiltration code is present. All functions serve data manipulation and presentation within the application context. The presence of only typical data handling routines suggests no malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or hidden backdoors, are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Qt data model for GUI applications. It does not contain malicious code or security risks, and its functionalities are consistent with standard data handling and display tasks. No signs of malware or supply chain attack vectors are present.",
