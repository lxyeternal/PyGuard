{
  "purpose": "This code implements a customizable data table model for a Qt application, supporting features like sorting, filtering, row collapsing, and data formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads data from internal _data list, receives data and configuration via setData() and setColumns() methods, and accesses internal dictionaries for formatting, sorting, and searching functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted input or network communication are present; data is managed internally and through Qt signals. No evident data leaks or external data transmissions occur.",
  "flows": "Data flows from setData() into internal _data; formatting and search functions are applied during data() calls; row expand/collapse signals are emitted based on internal state changes. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code structure and logic are consistent with a standard Qt data model. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. No dynamic execution or code injection identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of a data model with features like formatting, sorting, filtering, and row collapsing. All functions operate on internal data structures, with configurations set via public methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, credential theft, or data exfiltration. The class methods are well-structured, and signals are used appropriately for UI updates. The code is complex but appears to be a legitimate, feature-rich data model for a GUI application without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Qt data model implementation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet. It is likely safe for use, assuming external data sources are trustworthy.",
