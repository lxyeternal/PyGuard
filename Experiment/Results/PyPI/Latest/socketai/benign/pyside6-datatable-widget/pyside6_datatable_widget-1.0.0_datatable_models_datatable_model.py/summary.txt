  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Qt data model with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting minor potential misuse of user-defined functions. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for deployment."
