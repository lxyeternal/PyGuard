  "purpose": "A feature-rich Qt data model supporting sorting, filtering, formatting, row collapsing, and user-defined functions for customization.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures (_data, _headers, _column_keys, etc.), configuration via setters, data retrieval via data() method.",
  "sinks": "Data is managed internally; no external data sources, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal structures to the view via data() and signals; user-defined functions are set externally but invoked internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. User-defined functions could be misused if malicious, but this is a standard extensibility feature.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured Qt model implementation with comprehensive features. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of user-set functions introduces potential misuse risk but not malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The code's logic is straightforward, and the security implications are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Qt data model with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting minor potential misuse of user-defined functions. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for deployment.",
