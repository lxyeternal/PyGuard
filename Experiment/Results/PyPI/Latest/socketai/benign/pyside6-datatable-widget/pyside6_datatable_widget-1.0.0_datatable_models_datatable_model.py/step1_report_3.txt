{
  "purpose": "Define a customizable data model for a Qt-based data table with features like sorting, filtering, formatting, and row collapsing",
  "sources": "Data is set via setData method; column configuration via setColumns; formatting via setFormattingFunction; user interactions through setData, expand/collapse methods",
  "sinks": "Data modifications in setData and setData (editing), expansion/collapse signals, formatting functions, search functions, aggregation functions",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into _data, then accessed and manipulated through methods like data(), setData(), expandRow(), collapseRow(), and search(), with potential for untrusted input to influence displayed data or behaviors",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of signals for expansion/collapse is standard; no network or system access, obfuscation, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Qt data model with features for data display, formatting, editing, filtering, sorting, and row collapsing. It uses standard enums and signal/slot mechanisms for interaction. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. Formatting functions are set per column, default search and sort functions are based on data types, and expansion/collapse mechanisms use internal state tracking. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured data model for UI representation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Qt data model implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages data presentation and user interaction features without any suspicious or harmful code. Overall, it appears safe and intended for UI data management.",
