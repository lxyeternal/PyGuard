  "sinks": "None present. No data is processed from external sources or written to sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data flow is limited to internal class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'veunes' instead of 'venues'; no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of data model classes using pydantic with immutable configuration. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network calls, or input/output operations. The only notable issue is a typographical error ('veunes'). No malicious or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward data schema generated by a code generator, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe.",
