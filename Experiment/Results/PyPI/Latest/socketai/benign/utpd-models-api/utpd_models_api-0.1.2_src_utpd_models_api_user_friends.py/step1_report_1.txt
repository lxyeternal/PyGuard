{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a friends JSON data structure using Pydantic, primarily for data validation and type enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code reads static schema definitions and constants; no external data input or untrusted sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines immutable data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be generated and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Pydantic data models for JSON validation. It uses frozen configuration to ensure immutability. The models represent user and response data, including nested models. No external inputs, network operations, or data manipulation are performed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is the use of 'model_config' for configuration, which is standard in Pydantic v2, and no risky practices are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated data model schema for JSON validation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted data or execute external commands.",
