  "purpose": "Define data models for user friends and related metadata using pydantic for data validation and immutability.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, field declarations, and imports; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output operations or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares data models.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'veunes' field in UnreadCount (likely intended as 'venues'); no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple immutable data models with fields relevant to user friends and metadata, primarily for serialization/deserialization. No external input handling, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or sensitive operations. The only anomaly is the typo in the 'UnreadCount' model which appears to be a benign mistake. The code is straightforward and used for data structure purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative data modeling without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
