  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated data models for user info, with no external data input or processing logic. Use of 'Any' for contact and settings is noted but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to 'Any' types.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Data models for user profiles, with untrusted data flowing into models but no direct vulnerabilities. 'Any' types are flexible but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — still very low, minor concern about 'Any' usage.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, models for user data, no dynamic code, no vulnerabilities. 'Any' types are flexible.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Data models for user info, no suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Pure data models, no code execution, no external interactions, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely data schema definitions with no executable or network code. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, auto-generated models with no obfuscation or hidden logic. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the use of 'Any' for 'contact' and 'settings', which could potentially allow unvalidated data, but this is typical in schema definitions and does not directly introduce security vulnerabilities. The reports' scores of 0.1-0.2 are reasonable. A conservative estimate would be **0.1**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of 'Any' types is standard in auto-generated schemas but warrants cautious downstream handling.\n- No data flows or external interactions suggest any security risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
