  "purpose": "Define data models for user-related information, including stats, notifications, and user details, generated by a code generator.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only static class definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely structural and does not execute any logic or handle data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' type for contact and settings, which could potentially be misused if instantiated improperly, but no malicious behavior is evident; the code appears to be standard model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic data model definitions for user data, with all fields being type-annotated. The models are configured as immutable (frozen). There are no functions, method calls, or data processing logic. The 'Any' types for contact and settings could allow flexible but potentially unsafe usage, but in this context, they are simply placeholders. The code is auto-generated, and no suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines data models for user information without any executable or malicious components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of 'Any' is typical for flexible data but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for schema definitions.",
