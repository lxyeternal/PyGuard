{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of auto-generated, immutable Pydantic data models representing user profile information, including nested structures for stats, notifications, contact, and settings.",
  "sources": "Data fields within the models, notably 'contact' and 'settings' typed as 'Any', which may accept untrusted input from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flows or external system interactions; models serve as data containers for serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into model instances, but no processing or external effects are present within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Any' for 'contact' and 'settings' introduces potential for unvalidated data, but no malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, auto-generated data schemas with no executable logic, network activity, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the 'Any' type, which could lead to validation issues if misused downstream, but does not constitute malicious behavior. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, static data models with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal potential issues, primarily related to type safety rather than security vulnerabilities. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
