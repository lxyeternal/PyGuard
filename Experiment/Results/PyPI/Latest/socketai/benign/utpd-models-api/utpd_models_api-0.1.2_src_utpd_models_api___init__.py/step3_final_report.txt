  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "The function 'hello' returning a hardcoded string; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external network calls, no sensitive information access.",
  "flows": "N/A; the function returns a static string without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate and the scores justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
