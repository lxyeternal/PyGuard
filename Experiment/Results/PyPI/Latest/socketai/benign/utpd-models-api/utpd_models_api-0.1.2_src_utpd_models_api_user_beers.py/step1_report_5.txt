{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for parsing the response from the Untappd API, including various entities like beers, breweries, user info, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Data is read from JSON structures returned by the API, specifically from API response payloads mapped to Pydantic models.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be passed into the models during deserialization, but the models themselves do not execute or process data in a way that leads to side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API JSON responses into Pydantic model instances, with no data manipulation, external calls, or untrusted data processing happening beyond deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward data models with proper use of type hints and frozen configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data models representing API response structures, including nested models and utility methods for comparison and hashing. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The models are designed for data validation and structured access, with no network operations, dynamic code execution, or data leaks present. The models are properly frozen, reducing the risk of unintended modifications. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured data models for API response parsing with no malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for safe data validation and does not exhibit malware or security vulnerabilities.",
