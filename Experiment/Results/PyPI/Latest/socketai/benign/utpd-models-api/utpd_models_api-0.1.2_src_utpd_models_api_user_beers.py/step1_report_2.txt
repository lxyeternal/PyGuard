  "purpose": "Defines data models for parsing Untappd API responses, primarily for data validation and structure.",
  "sources": "Data input from external API responses, user inputs, or data files during deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of untrusted data in application logic; no explicit sinks found in the models themselves.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into models, with no evidence of data manipulation or transfer to external systems within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; models are straightforward data containers. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Pydantic models for structured data representation of an API response. It contains typical data fields, including identifiers, timestamps, and nested models. No functions perform data processing, network operations, or execute code that could be malicious. The only method implementations are standard comparison and hashing for the 'Beer' model, based solely on the unique 'bid'. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of data models for API response parsing with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
