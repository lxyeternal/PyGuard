  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely data models for API response parsing.\n- No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or external calls are detected.\n- The only minor issue noted is a typo ('veunes' instead of 'venues') in the UnreadCount class, which is a non-malicious mistake.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly identifies the code as data models with no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the typo 'veunes'—accurate.\n- **Conclusion & scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same reasoning, no malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Consistent with previous analyses.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Score suggestion:** No change.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but the reasoning indicates no actual vulnerabilities, just a generic note.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's static, data-only nature, even a minimal securityRisk score seems unwarranted.\n- **Recommendation:** Set securityRisk to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree it's 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no security concern beyond a typo.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, generated set of immutable data models for API response parsing. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-vulnerable code is present. The only minor issue is a typo in a field name, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware=0.\n- Set securityRisk=0.\n- Confirm obfuscated=0.\n- No changes needed for the scores.\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
