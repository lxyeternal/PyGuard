  "purpose": "Define data models for parsing and validating the Untappd API response related to beers, breweries, and user data.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (functools.total_ordering, pydantic.BaseModel, etc.) and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any input/output operations, network requests, or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code is purely declarative model definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of pydantic model class definitions for deserializing the API response. The models are marked as frozen, indicating immutability, which is good practice. There are no input/output operations, no network calls, or other runtime behaviors. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are present. The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used for malicious purposes. It is a straightforward data schema setup for API response validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, read-only data models with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be generated from a schema definition for a specific API response, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
