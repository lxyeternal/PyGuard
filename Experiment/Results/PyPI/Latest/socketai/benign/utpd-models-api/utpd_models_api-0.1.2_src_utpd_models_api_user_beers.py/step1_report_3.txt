  "purpose": "Data models representing responses from the Untappd API for beer-related information.",
  "sources": "Python code defining Pydantic models, including imported modules and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not handle untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines data structures without execution logic or data flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines immutable data models using Pydantic, with no functions executing dynamic code or network operations. It uses standard Python features and well-structured class definitions. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration or code injection mechanisms, are present. The models serve as structured representations for API responses, with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of data models for API responses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
