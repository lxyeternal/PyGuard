  "purpose": "Data models for parsing Untappd API responses, generated via schema tools for structured data deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON structures representing API responses, with no external input sources or runtime data fetching.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; the code only defines immutable data containers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input into the defined models during deserialization; no dynamic or runtime code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'UnreadCount' class: 'veunes' instead of 'venues'. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic data models with no functions executing code, network calls, or dynamic behavior. The models are immutable, serving purely as data schemas. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only minor anomaly is a typo, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are also zero or negligible, reflecting the safe, static nature of the code. The minimal risk score in one report (0.1) is overly conservative given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, well-structured, immutable data models for API response parsing. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor typo in a field name, which does not affect security. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use.",
