{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'pomsimulator' Python module, including metadata, author info, dependencies, and modules.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: name, version, author, author_email, description, py_modules, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The 'py_modules' parameter is set to 'pomsimulator/modules', which is likely incorrectly formatted; typically, 'py_modules' expects a list of module filenames or module names, not paths. This is a configuration issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, external input, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is the 'py_modules' parameter's format, which may cause installation issues but does not pose a security threat. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and correctly structured for the most part, with a minor configuration issue that does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
