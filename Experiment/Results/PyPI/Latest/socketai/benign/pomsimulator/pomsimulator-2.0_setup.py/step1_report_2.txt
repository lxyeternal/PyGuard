  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for 'pomsimulator' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code primarily sets package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external calls based on user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only specifies static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The email addresses are publicly known contacts, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The install_requires list specifies common scientific Python packages with version constraints, which is typical for such setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and is a standard configuration file for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
