  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pomsimulator' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, author info, description, modules, and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data sources are used that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from static metadata to dependency installation instructions, with no dynamic or external data inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It includes author contact info and dependency version constraints. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data inputs are present. All data appears static and appropriate for a package setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply declares package metadata and dependencies.",
