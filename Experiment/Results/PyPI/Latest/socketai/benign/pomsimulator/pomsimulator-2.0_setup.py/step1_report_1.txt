{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'pomsimulator', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package name, version, author info, description, modules, and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted input or external data being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely declarative configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard setup configuration with no suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies for package distribution. All data are hardcoded strings and lists with no dynamic or external input involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
