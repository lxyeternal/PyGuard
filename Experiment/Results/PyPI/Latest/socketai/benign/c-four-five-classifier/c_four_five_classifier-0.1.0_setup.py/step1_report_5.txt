{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'c_four_five_classifier', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static data in setup() parameters; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system compromise are present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows; the setup process is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. All code appears to be standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No code injection, no untrusted inputs, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The dependencies listed are common Python libraries, and the code structure follows typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
