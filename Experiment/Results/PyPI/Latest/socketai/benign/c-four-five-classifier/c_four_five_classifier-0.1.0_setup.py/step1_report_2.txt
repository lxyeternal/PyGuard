{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'c_four_five_classifier' using setuptools, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; defines package metadata and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data or user input processing or output handling present",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description; installs specified dependencies; package installation process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Standard setup script structure; no obfuscated or unusual code segments",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted data handling, and no malicious constructs detected. The dependencies are common Python libraries, and there is no code that performs network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. All operations are consistent with typical setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
