  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The code simply reads a README.md file and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies.\n- No untrusted input handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or other risky behaviors are present.\n- Dependencies are common and appropriate for such a project.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it's a typical setup.py script.\n- No issues with the code's logic or structure.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None identified across the reports.\n- The code is straightforward and follows best practices for Python packaging.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1, with 1 indicating high confidence in benignity.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Malware score: 0, since no malicious activity is detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- Risk score: 0, reflecting no security risks.\n\n### Critical Review:\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all observations are consistent with the code.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data processing.\n- The dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The overall security posture is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
