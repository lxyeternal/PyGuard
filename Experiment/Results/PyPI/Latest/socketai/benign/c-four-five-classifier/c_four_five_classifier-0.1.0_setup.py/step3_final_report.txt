  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading README.md for long description, and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static parameters in setup() call",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() call with static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a README.md file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The dependencies are standard, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
