  "purpose": "Implementation of a C4.5 decision tree classifier for supervised learning tasks, including methods for training, predicting, visualizing, and managing the decision tree.",
  "sources": "Data input through the 'fit' method (dataset parameter), feature selection, and attribute access in various functions. No external untrusted sources or inputs beyond the provided dataset are read.",
  "sinks": "Predictions generated by 'predict' method; visualization output saved as an image file via Graphviz; no network or system command execution, file access, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is input via 'fit' → internal attributes set → decision tree built with 'c45' → predictions made with 'predict' → visualization with 'visualize_tree'. No suspicious or external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard libraries and typical decision tree logic. No hidden or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard C4.5 decision tree classifier with functions for entropy, information gain, gain ratio, and tree building. It uses numpy and math for calculations and graphviz for visualization. The methods for splitting, pruning, and prediction are conventional. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The visualization saves and views a decision tree image without executing external commands beyond Graphviz, which is normal. The code does not process untrusted inputs from external sources or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a decision tree classifier with visualization capabilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It appears to be a benign, standard machine learning utility.",
