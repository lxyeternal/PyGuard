{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a class named C45Classifier, likely for use in machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module .c45",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "None, as there is no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. All elements are standard Python practices for module organization. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module definition for a machine learning classifier with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
