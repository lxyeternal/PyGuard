  "purpose": "Package initialization module importing a class, setting version, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module, version string assignment, __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, no untrusted input, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import from local module to namespace, no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata setup, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python package __init__.py file. It imports a class from a local module, sets a version string, and defines __all__. There are no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports generally reflect the benign nature, though some reports overstate the security risk score. Given the simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, the appropriate malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero. The security risk score should be adjusted to 0 in reports where it is slightly elevated (e.g., 0.1), to accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
