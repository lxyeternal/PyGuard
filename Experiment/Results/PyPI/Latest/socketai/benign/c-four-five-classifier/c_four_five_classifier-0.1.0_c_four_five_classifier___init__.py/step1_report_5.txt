{
  "purpose": "This module imports the C45Classifier class and defines package version and exported symbols, likely for a machine learning library.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines internal module variables and imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only performs static assignments and import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a local module, setting version information, and defining exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as a simple package initialization module.",
