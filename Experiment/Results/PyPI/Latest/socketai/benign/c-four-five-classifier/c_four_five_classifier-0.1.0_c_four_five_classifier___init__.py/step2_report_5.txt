  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\nThe code snippet is a typical `__init__.py` for a Python package, importing a class from a local module and defining package metadata (`__version__` and `__all__`). There are no data flows, external inputs, or complex logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, and all reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, and no malicious activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malware are present.\n- The code is benign, serving as package setup.\n\n### Logical errors or mistakes:\n- None detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are very conservative and accurate; they do not overstate the risk.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the code's benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the code snippet and the consensus in the reports:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1, but likely 0 since there's no risk at all)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments needed.",
