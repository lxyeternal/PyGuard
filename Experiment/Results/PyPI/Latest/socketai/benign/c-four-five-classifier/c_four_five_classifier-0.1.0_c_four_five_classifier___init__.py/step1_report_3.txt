{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to expose a class C45Classifier from a module c45 and define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .c45, __version__, and __all__ variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external connections or data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; no source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward package metadata; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, sets versioning info, and declares exported symbols. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscated patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The simplicity suggests a standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages imports and package metadata.",
