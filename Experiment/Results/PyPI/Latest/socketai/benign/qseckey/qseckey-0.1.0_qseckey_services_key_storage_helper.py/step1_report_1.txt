  "purpose": "Manage cryptographic keys by storing, retrieving, and deleting them from a storage backend within an application.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (key_id, application_id, key_data).",
  "sinks": "Storage system via methods like save_key, read_keys, delete_keys; logs info messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into storage methods; retrieved keys are logged and deleted; key storage operations manipulate data based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. Logging sensitive key info may be a privacy concern but not malicious. No unusual or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton class for managing key storage operations, including storing, retrieving, counting, and deleting keys via a 'KeyStorage' backend. Input parameters are passed directly to storage methods without validation or sanitization, but since these are standard key management operations, this is expected. The code logs key retrievals, which could be a privacy concern but not malicious. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices beyond the need for proper key management policies. The absence of hardcoded credentials or network activity reduces malware risk. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused on key management tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard key management utility with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles cryptographic keys securely at the API level but relies on the underlying 'KeyStorage' implementation for security. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present.",
