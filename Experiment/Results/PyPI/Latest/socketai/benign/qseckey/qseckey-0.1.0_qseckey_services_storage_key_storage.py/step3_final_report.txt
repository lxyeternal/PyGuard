  "purpose": "A singleton class managing in-memory cryptographic keys with methods to save, read, delete, and export keys as JSON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in save_key(), read_keys(), delete_keys(); internal storage in _storage.",
  "sinks": "to_json() method exposes entire key storage; logging in save_key() outputs key and application IDs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs into _storage; to_json() serializes all stored data for export.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for key storage with standard CRUD operations. No external network or system calls are present. The exposure of all stored keys via to_json() could be sensitive if misused, but this is typical for such a component. Logging may leak key IDs, but is standard for audit purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering the potential data exposure as a non-malicious trade-off.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward singleton key management utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The only potential concern is data exposure via to_json(), which is typical for such components and not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain inclusion with standard precautions regarding data exposure.",
