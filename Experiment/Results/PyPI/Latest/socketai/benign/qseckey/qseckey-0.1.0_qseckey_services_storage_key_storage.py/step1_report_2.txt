  "purpose": "A singleton class that manages in-memory storage of cryptographic keys, allowing saving, reading, deleting, and exporting keys as JSON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods: key_id, application_id, key_data; internal storage (_storage).",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization in to_json(), logging info in save_key().",
  "flows": "save_key() writes data into _storage; read_keys() retrieves data; delete_keys() removes data; to_json() exports _storage; logging in save_key().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution observed. The code manages keys securely in memory, no external communication or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton class for managing cryptographic keys in-memory, with methods for saving, reading, deleting, and exporting. It does not include external data input sources beyond method parameters, nor external sinks such as network calls. Logging is used for internal activity tracking. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are present. The use of in-memory storage mitigates risks of persistent data leakage. Overall, the code appears straightforward and secure with respect to supply chain security. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured in-memory key management class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It lacks external data sources, network activity, or malicious payloads. It appears safe and appropriate for managing cryptographic keys within a larger application.",
