  "purpose": "Manage quantum circuit execution either locally or via IBM Quantum cloud, including backend setup and job execution.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings for USE_SIMULATOR and IBM_TOKEN; external API calls to Qiskit and IBM services; logging statements.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs (job IDs, counts, data) which could potentially leak sensitive information if logs are exposed.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings -> Backend initialization -> Circuit transpilation or preparation -> Job submission -> Result retrieval -> Logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; no suspicious code patterns; standard API usage; no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton class for managing quantum backend setup and execution, supporting local simulation and IBM Quantum cloud. It handles tokens via external settings, performs standard API calls, and logs job details. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is detected. Logging of job IDs and results is typical but should be secured in production. Exception handling during backend setup is appropriate. Overall, the code appears benign, with minor security considerations related to logging practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. No signs of supply chain attack or sabotage are present. The minor security risk pertains to logging sensitive info, which is manageable. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
