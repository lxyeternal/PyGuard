  "purpose": "Manage cryptographic keys and initialize key management system based on provided configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data in the register_connection and get_key functions, particularly the 'data' parameter and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the data passed to register_connection and get_key, which are forwarded to key_manager methods.",
  "flows": "Data received via register_connection and get_key flows into key_manager methods, which may process or store the data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code. The code uses standard logging setup. No external or suspicious network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a key management system, allowing external input through 'register_connection' and 'get_key' functions. Inputs are passed to the key_manager object, which is an instance of KeyManager. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious operations such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. Logging configuration is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The structure appears straightforward and intended for managing cryptographic keys securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard key management module with no signs of malicious behavior. It only exposes functions to initialize and access keys, relying on the underlying KeyManager implementation. No malicious or suspicious actions are evident in this fragment.",
