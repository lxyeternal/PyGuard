Scores are appropriately cautious, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for reports 2 and 5. Overall, the code warrants further manual review, especially for reports with obfuscation and dynamic features."

The only potential concern is data exposure via to_json(), which is typical for such components and not indicative of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain inclusion with standard precautions regarding data exposure."
