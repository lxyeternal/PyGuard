{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'qseckey', including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities; setup functions do not execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script reads files and passes data to setup(), no untrusted data flow or execution of code from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed; standard setup script structure",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, reads dependencies from a requirements file, and calls setup() with package metadata. It reads files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md') but does not execute or evaluate their content beyond reading. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration and dependency loading without executing untrusted code or performing any malicious actions.",
