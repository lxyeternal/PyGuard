  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, reading dependencies from requirements.txt and long description from README.md, and configuring package metadata with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication",
  "flows": "Static file reads to setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive points",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reads, no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static file reads and package configuration. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. Minor concerns about unguarded open() calls are standard in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
