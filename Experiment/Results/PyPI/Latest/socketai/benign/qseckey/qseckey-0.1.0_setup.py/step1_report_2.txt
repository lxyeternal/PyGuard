{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'qseckey' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt', reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write or send data to external sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is primarily configuration and setup, with no data flow involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads dependencies and description files, and configures package metadata. It does not perform any network operations, process untrusted input beyond reading files, or include executable code that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a normal package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
