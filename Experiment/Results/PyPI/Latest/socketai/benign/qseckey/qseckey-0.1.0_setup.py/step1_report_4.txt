  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'qseckey', including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt', opening and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data handling or output that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies and long description from files, then passing data to 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading dependencies, defining package metadata, and calling 'setup()'. It uses standard libraries and straightforward file I/O. There are no hardcoded credentials, code execution, or network activities. No unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged.",
