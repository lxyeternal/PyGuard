  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'qseckey' Python library, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt' and reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file write/transfer operations occur within this script.",
  "flows": "Input from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files flows into package configuration data, which is used by the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup process; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading dependencies and long description, then configuring package metadata. It does not include any code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The use of 'find_packages()' and reading files is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
