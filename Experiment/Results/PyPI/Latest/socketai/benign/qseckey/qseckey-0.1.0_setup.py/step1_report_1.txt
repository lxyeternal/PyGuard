{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'qseckey', including its metadata and dependencies, to facilitate packaging and distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies; reading 'README.md' for long description; static assignment of package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this code; no data flows from untrusted sources to vulnerable points.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code is primarily static configuration with file reads that are controlled and trusted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py pattern with safe practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and sets up package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, and classifiers. The use of 'open' to read 'README.md' is standard for long descriptions. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. All operations are read-only file accesses and static assignments, typical in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for package distribution purposes.",
