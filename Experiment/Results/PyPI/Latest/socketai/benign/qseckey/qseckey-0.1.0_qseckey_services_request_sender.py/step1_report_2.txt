{
  "purpose": "A utility class to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a specified base URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the base URL during class instantiation, and the endpoint, params, data, json, and headers during method calls.",
  "sinks": "Response objects returned after successful requests; logs exceptions using the logger.",
  "flows": "The flow starts from method calls (get/post), constructs a URL, makes an HTTP request, and returns the response or logs an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious data handling or obfuscated code. Logging exceptions at info level is benign but could be a minor concern if sensitive data were logged (though none is).",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward HTTP request wrapper with basic error handling. It does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or unsafe practices. It does not include any external data sources beyond method parameters. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The logging of exceptions is standard practice, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of a request sender class without malicious intent or security issues. It functions as an HTTP client utility, with no signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
