{
  "purpose": "A utility class to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a specified base URL",
  "sources": "The 'base_url' parameter used during class instantiation, and the 'endpoint', 'params', 'headers', 'data', and 'json' arguments in method calls",
  "sinks": "The 'response' returned from requests, and potential logging of exceptions",
  "flows": "Input parameters (base_url, endpoint, params, headers, data, json) are combined to form URLs and request data, which then flow to the requests library; responses and exceptions are logged and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected. Logging only exception messages; no sensitive data handled explicitly",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the 'requests' library for GET and POST methods. It logs exceptions rather than propagating errors or exposing sensitive data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or insecure practices. Usage of user input in URL construction is standard, and no untrusted data is being mishandled or leaked. The logging of exceptions is minimal but acceptable. Overall, the code appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic HTTP request helper with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The implementation is simple, clean, and appears safe.",
