{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple HTTP request wrapper class for sending GET and POST requests to a specified base URL.",
  "sources": "The base URL and endpoint parameters used in get() and post() methods.",
  "sinks": "The responses returned from requests.get() and requests.post(), and logging of exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (endpoint, params, data/json, headers) flow into requests methods, and responses are returned or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or misleading code constructs; logging of exceptions is basic and non-sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, wrapping the requests library for HTTP calls with basic error handling. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The exception handling only logs errors without exposing sensitive data, and there are no indirect data flows that pose security risks. The use of requests library is standard and does not involve unsafe practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, safe HTTP request wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard network requests with minimal error handling and logging, suitable for legitimate use.",
