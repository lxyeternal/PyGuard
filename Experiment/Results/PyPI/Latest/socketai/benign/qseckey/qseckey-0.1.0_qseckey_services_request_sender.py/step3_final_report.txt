{
  "purpose": "A simple Python class wrapping the requests library to send HTTP GET and POST requests with basic error handling and logging.",
  "sources": "The class reads input from method parameters such as 'endpoint', 'params', 'headers', 'data', and 'json'.",
  "sinks": "The code returns response objects; logs exceptions; does not write or send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct URLs and request data; responses are returned directly; exceptions are logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; exception handling is minimal and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward HTTP request wrapper with standard practices. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Exception handling logs errors at info level without exposing sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or insecure operations are present. The code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for HTTP requests with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with its straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary.",
