{
  "purpose": "A simple HTTP request wrapper class to send GET and POST requests to a specified base URL.",
  "sources": "The base_url parameter provided during class instantiation; endpoint, params, data, json, and headers parameters in get and post methods.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get and requests.post calls, which send untrusted data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (endpoint, params, data, json, headers) flow into URL composition and request functions, which then send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending HTTP requests with flexible parameters. It logs request exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The code relies on the requests library, which is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. All input data are passed directly to requests without unsafe handling beyond standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP request wrapper with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs basic request operations with proper error logging.",
