  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), network and file I/O, obfuscated variables, indirect control flow.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, data transfer points, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and eval/exec statements to sinks like network sockets or system commands, via dynamic code execution and obfuscated variables.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores (0.7), use of eval/exec, indirect control flow, lack of documentation, suspicious patterns without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets exhibit patterns typical of obfuscated or suspicious scripts, notably in reports 2 and 5, with dynamic execution and obfuscation. The scores assigned—obfuscated at 0.7, malware at 0.2–0.4, and moderate security risk—are justified by these patterns. Benign or minimal code in reports 1, 3, and 4 show no suspicious activity. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, emphasizing caution due to obfuscation and dynamic code but lacking concrete malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns in some reports, indicating potential malicious intent, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores are appropriately cautious, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for reports 2 and 5. Overall, the code warrants further manual review, especially for reports with obfuscation and dynamic features.",
