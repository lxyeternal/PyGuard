  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns in some reports, indicating potential malicious intent, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores are appropriately cautious, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for reports 2 and 5. Overall, the code warrants further manual review, especially for reports with obfuscation and dynamic features."
