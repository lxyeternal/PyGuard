  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the imported functions in 'core'. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is very low (~0.05-0.1) to account for potential maliciousness in 'core'. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
