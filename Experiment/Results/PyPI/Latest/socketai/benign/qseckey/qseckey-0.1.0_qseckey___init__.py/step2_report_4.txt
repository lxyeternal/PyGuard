  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of importing three functions from a local module `.core` and defining `__all__` to export them.\n- No data processing, input handling, network operations, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The core module (`.core`) is not included, so potential maliciousness or vulnerabilities depend on its implementation, which is not visible here.\n- The code is a standard pattern for exposing internal functions in a Python package/module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that this code is straightforward and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No flaws or mistakes are present** in the code snippet itself. The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with a few reports assigning 0.1 or 0.2 due to the potential risk of malicious imported functions. This is cautious but reasonable, given the code's reliance on external functions.\n\n### Risk and malware justification:\n- Since the code only re-exports functions, **the risk or malware scores should not be higher than 0.1** unless there's evidence of malicious content in the imported functions, which we cannot see here.\n- The **scores assigned seem appropriate** given the information.\n\n### Potential assumptions and vulnerabilities:\n- Any claims about vulnerabilities are based on the assumption that the imported functions are safe. Without inspecting `core`, we cannot confirm their safety.\n- No vulnerabilities are implied or suggested solely by this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** or **0.1** (minimal, based on potential issues in the imported module, but not in this code itself)\n\n---\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or patterns present.                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward and readable.                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0 – 0.1         | Very low; depends on external functions, but not evident here. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is benign, the security posture depends on the implementation of the imported functions in `core`. A comprehensive security assessment would require reviewing that module as well.",
