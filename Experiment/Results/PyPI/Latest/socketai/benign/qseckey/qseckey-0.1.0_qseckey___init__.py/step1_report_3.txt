  "purpose": "This code exports specific functions from the local module 'core' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions 'initialize', 'register_connection', and 'get_key' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions with data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a local module and defines an __all__ list to specify exports. It appears to be part of a larger package, serving as an API surface. No input handling, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is simple and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
