  "purpose": "Re-export functions initialize, register_connection, and get_key from the local core module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "Import from .core → exported functions via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as a module interface. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of the imported functions, which are not visible here. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the imported functions in 'core'. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is very low (~0.05-0.1) to account for potential maliciousness in 'core'. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
