  "purpose": "Export functions initialize, register_connection, and get_key from the core module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed within this code snippet; relies on imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code complexity; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns. The code simply re-exports selected functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local core module and exposes them via __all__, indicating an intention to control namespace exports. There are no indications of data handling, input processing, or suspicious activity. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. Since it is a straightforward re-export, the potential for malicious behavior depends entirely on the imported core module, which is outside this code snippet. No security risks or malware are detected here based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple interface for exporting functions from a core module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident in this snippet. It appears safe and standard.",
