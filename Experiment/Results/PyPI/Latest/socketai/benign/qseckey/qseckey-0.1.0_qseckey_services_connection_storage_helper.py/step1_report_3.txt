{
  "purpose": "Manage storage and retrieval of connection data and associated keys, implementing singleton pattern for the helper class.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters (application_id, connection_data, key, value), and external storage via connectionStorage and key_storage_helper objects.",
  "sinks": "Database/storage operations (create, read, store_connection, delete), logging, and updating data in connection storage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into storage methods; data retrieved from storage is combined with key storage info and returned; updates flow from method calls into storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; code appears to perform typical storage management functions. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton helper class for managing connection data, interacting with storage and key management modules. It performs standard CRUD operations and maintains connection state. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. Logging is used appropriately. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. The flow of data is straightforward, and no external or hidden activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard storage management component with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It manages connection data securely within its scope without any indicators of malware or security risks.",
