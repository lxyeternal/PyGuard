  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module or script that may involve data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input functions and reads data from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing data to the console, writing to files, or sending data over network connections (if present in unshown parts).",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and environment variables to internal variables, possibly to output functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no obfuscated code patterns. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and user input, processes it with functions, and may output results or perform network actions. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors detected. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The code does not demonstrate insecure practices like unsafe SQL or unsafe execution.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code appears to be a standard utility or processing script with no suspicious activity detected.",
