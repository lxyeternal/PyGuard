  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, dynamic functions like eval()/exec(), input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into functions like eval()/exec() or network calls, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, complex control flow suggestive of obfuscation, incomplete or missing code snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign or incomplete code with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 shows suspicious patterns such as eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets, justifying higher obfuscation (0.7) and malware (0.4) scores, though these could be slightly increased to reflect stronger suspicion. The other reports are consistent with benign code, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with Report 4 being the most suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are mostly benign or incomplete, with one report (Report 4) indicating potential obfuscation and malicious patterns. The scores are justified and consistent with the evidence, with a slight possibility to elevate malware suspicion in Report 4 if more malicious activity is confirmed.",
