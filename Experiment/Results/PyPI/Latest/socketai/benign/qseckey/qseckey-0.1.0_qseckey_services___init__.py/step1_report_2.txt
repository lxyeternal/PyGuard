  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of any comments or documentation within the code snippet. It appears to be a generic Python script potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables, environment variables, or external modules. Specific sources are not identifiable because the code is missing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print(), logging, network requests, or file operations. These are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, it is impossible to determine source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "The provided code snippet is empty or missing; therefore, no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns can be identified.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of any code content, a thorough step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No data sources, sinks, or flows are observable. The code appears to be empty or incomplete, which makes assessment impossible.",
  "conclusion": "The submitted code is empty or missing, preventing any meaningful security analysis. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be identified from the provided input.",
