  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author fields, unconventional version number (0.0.0.1), but these are benign placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic code, user input, external data, or suspicious patterns are present. The version number is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. All signals indicate a benign, boilerplate package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
