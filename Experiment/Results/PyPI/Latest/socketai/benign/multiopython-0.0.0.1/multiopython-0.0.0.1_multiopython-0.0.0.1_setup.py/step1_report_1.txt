  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'multiopython' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static data used only for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; all code is standard for a setup script. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined package metadata. No user input or external data sources are used. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The package appears to be a placeholder with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard boilerplate setup script with no security risks.",
