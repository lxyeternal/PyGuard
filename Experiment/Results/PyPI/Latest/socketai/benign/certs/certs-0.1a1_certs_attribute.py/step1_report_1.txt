  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata for a project related to creating self-signed SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "Constants defining project metadata (__project__, __version__, __urlhome__, __description__, __author__, __author_email__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static assignment of strings",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets beyond metadata, no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of module-level metadata variables. It contains no functions, no data input, no external data fetching, and no code execution. It adheres to standard Python syntax and conventions for metadata definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code simply documents project information, including author and project URL.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of metadata declarations for the project. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
