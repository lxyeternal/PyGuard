  "purpose": "This code provides metadata for a project related to creating self-signed SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The metadata is hardcoded as string variables at the top of the script, including project name, version, URL, description, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code only defines static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard header with project information.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of variable assignments defining project metadata. It contains no input handling, no function calls, and no execution logic. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. It appears to be a typical header or metadata section for a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, providing static project information without any malicious intent or security risks.",
