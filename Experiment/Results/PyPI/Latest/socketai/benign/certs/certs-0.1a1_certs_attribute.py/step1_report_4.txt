  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a project that creates self-signed SSL certificates",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines string variables with project information",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code is purely declarative",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no suspicious code, hidden functions, or obfuscated segments",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level string variable assignments providing project metadata such as name, version, URL, description, author, and email. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. No indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a straightforward project descriptor with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only contains descriptive metadata about a project related to SSL certificate creation. No security risks or malware are detected.",
