  "sinks": "No data processing, input, or output operations; no untrusted data flows present",
  "flows": "None, as there are only metadata variable assignments with no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; only static metadata assignments",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting project metadata such as project name, version, URL, description, author, and email. There are no input or output operations, no code execution, and no external interactions. This appears to be standard metadata documentation. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious activity.",
