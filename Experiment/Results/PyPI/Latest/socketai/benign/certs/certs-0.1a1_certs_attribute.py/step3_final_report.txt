  "purpose": "This code defines static metadata variables for a Python project, including project name, version, URL, description, author, and email.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string assignments for metadata variables (__project__, __version__, __urlhome__, __description__, __author__, __author_email__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining project metadata. It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, metadata-only, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, static metadata header with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
