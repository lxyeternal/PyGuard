  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, importing metadata, reading requirements, and defining installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Metadata imported from certs.attribute; requirements.txt file; URL variables; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network connections, data leaks, or external code execution.",
  "flows": "Metadata and requirements are read from local files/modules; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; placeholder custom install class is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with standard practices. It imports package metadata, reads dependencies, and configures package setup without dynamic code execution or network activity. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present. The custom install class is a placeholder and does not perform any malicious actions. URLs are constructed from predefined variables, and no obfuscation or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe configuration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
