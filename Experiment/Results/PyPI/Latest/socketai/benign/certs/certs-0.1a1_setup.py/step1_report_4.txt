  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, defining metadata, requirements, and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt' file to determine dependencies; imports from 'certs.attribute' module for metadata; uses 'setuptools' for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file -> uses imported metadata -> passes data into 'setup' function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports package metadata from a module, reads dependencies from a text file, and defines a custom install command that currently executes the default behavior without additional malicious code. All operations are typical for package distribution setup. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or supply chain attack mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It reads package metadata and dependencies to configure the package installation process. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
