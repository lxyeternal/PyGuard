{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools, configuring metadata, dependencies, and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt file, importing package attributes for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Read requirements from file -> package setup configuration -> custom install class execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard setuptools functions and normal imports; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package metadata from a local module, reads dependencies from requirements.txt, and configures setup parameters including URL and package discovery. The custom install class extends standard installation without injecting additional malicious behavior. No code injections, network communications, or suspicious code flows are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script with well-structured, standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to package and install the Python project, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
