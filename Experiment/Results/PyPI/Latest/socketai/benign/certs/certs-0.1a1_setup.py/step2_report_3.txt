  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package.\n- It imports package metadata from `certs.attribute`.\n- Reads dependencies from `requirements.txt`.\n- Uses `setuptools` to configure package setup.\n- Defines a `CustomInstallCommand` that currently only calls the parent `install.run()` method.\n- URL construction via `urljoin` from a local attribute.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- No network activity or data leaks are evident.\n- The code appears to follow best practices for package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is a typical setup script.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The custom install class does not perform any malicious actions.\n- All data flows are from trusted sources (local modules, requirements file).\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or external code execution.\n- The URLs are constructed from predefined variables, no dynamic or external inputs.\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- **Issues are not present** in the code based on the reports and the code itself.\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The use of `__attribute__` for metadata is standard.\n- The custom install class is a placeholder for potential future behavior but currently benign.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or near 0.\n- This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, 0 or near 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **No changes needed** to the scores based on the evidence.\n- The reports are consistent with the code analysis.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for the placeholder custom install class, but it's benign)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
