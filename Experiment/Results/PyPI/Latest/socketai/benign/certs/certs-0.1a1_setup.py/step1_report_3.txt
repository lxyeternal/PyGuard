{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring installation parameters, package discovery, and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from certs.attribute module, reading requirements.txt file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from certs.attribute module and requirements.txt into setup configuration; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The only custom behavior is a placeholder for post-installation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package metadata from a local module, reads requirements from a local file, and configures setup parameters accordingly. It defines a custom install class that currently only calls the parent run method, with a placeholder for additional actions. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated payloads. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving as a conventional configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
