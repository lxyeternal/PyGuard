  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements, reading requirements.txt, URL concatenation, package discovery, and custom install class.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code primarily manages package setup and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Read requirements from file -> set up package metadata -> custom install run -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports metadata attributes from certs.attribute, reads dependencies from requirements.txt, and configures the installation process with a custom class. The URL joins and reading from a requirements file are typical practices. No network communications, hidden backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The custom install class executes the default install process without added malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
