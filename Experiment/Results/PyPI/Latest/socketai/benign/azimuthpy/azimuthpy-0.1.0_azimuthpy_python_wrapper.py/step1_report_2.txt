{
  "purpose": "Convert AnnData objects to Seurat format, perform cell type annotation via Azimuth, and integrate the results back into AnnData.",
  "sources": "Reads AnnData layers, var_names, obs_names; accesses global environment and R objects; reads 'meta.data' and UMAP embeddings from Azimuth output.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to R environment, modifies AnnData object in Python by joining metadata and adding embeddings.",
  "flows": "AnnData layers -> R matrix via numpy2ri -> R environment -> Seurat object -> Azimuth mapping -> Extracted metadata and embeddings -> join to AnnData.obs and obsm.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'globalenv' for passing data; creation of R objects directly from numpy arrays; manual setting of row/column names; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external connections; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code converts AnnData objects into Seurat format for downstream analysis with R packages. It actively manages data transfer between Python and R using rpy2 and numpy2ri. Functions are modular, performing standard conversion, annotation, and data merging tasks. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious data handling is evident. The code relies on legitimate packages and standard data flow patterns. The use of 'globalenv' and manual row/column assignment appears standard for R-Python interoperability, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs expected data conversions and annotation tasks using open-source R and Python packages. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The structure and data handling are consistent with legitimate bioinformatics workflows.",
