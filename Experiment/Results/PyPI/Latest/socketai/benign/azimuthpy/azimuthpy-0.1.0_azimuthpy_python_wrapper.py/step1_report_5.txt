{
  "purpose": "Convert AnnData object to Seurat format, run Azimuth cell type annotation, and integrate results back into AnnData.",
  "sources": "adata.layers, adata.var_names, adata.obs_names, external R packages ('Seurat', 'SeuratObject', 'Azimuth'), environment variables during package imports.",
  "sinks": "Global R environment 'counts' object, R package functions, and data returned from R to Python, especially in adata.obs and adata.obsm.",
  "flows": "adata_to_seurat extracts data, sets in R environment, creates Seurat object; run_azimuth calls R function; extract_meta_data reads R object slots; annotate_adata_azimuth merges data back into AnnData.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic R code string construction for setting row and column names; direct assignment to global R environment; no apparent hardcoded secrets or unusual obfuscation; no suspicious network calls or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data conversions between Python and R for single-cell data analysis, using well-known packages such as Seurat and Azimuth. The process involves data conversion, R function calls, and data integration, all consistent with typical bioinformatics workflows. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of R environment manipulation is standard for this context, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code's overall behavior is aligned with legitimate bioinformatics data processing, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard bioinformatics pipeline for cell type annotation using Seurat and Azimuth, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code follows typical data handling and package usage patterns for this domain.",
