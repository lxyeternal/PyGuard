  "purpose": "Importing the 'annotate_adata_azimuth' function from a local module 'python_wrapper'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'python_wrapper' from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of a function from a module within the package. No runtime data handling, user input, or network activity is visible. The import statement alone does not suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is common in Python projects to organize code this way.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard module importation with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
