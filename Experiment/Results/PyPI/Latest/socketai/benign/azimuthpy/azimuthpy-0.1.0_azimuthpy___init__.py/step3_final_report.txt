  "purpose": "Import a local function 'annotate_adata_azimuth' from the 'python_wrapper' module for data annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "None; the import simply makes a function available within the module scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement importing 'annotate_adata_azimuth' from a local module. No code execution, data flow, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The import is from a relative module, which is common in package structures. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious indicators are evident. The import alone does not pose any security risk or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are appropriate. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation given the context. Overall, the code is benign, and the reports correctly identify its harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is standard, safe, and presents no security or malicious concerns. All reports correctly assess this, and the scores should be set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No further action or revision is necessary.",
