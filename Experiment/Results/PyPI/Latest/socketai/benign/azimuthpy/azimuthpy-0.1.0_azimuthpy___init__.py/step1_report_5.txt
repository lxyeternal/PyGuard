  "purpose": "Importing the 'annotate_adata_azimuth' function from a local module 'python_wrapper'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'python_wrapper' from the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "N/A — only an import statement, no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The file is too short to determine any malicious intent or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks are present here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical import statement for modular code structure. No evidence of malware or security issues detected.",
