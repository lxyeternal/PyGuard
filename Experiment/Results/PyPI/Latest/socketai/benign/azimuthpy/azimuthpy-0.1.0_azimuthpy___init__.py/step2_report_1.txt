  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .python_wrapper import annotate_adata_azimuth`.\n- The import is from a local module, likely within the same package.\n- No code execution, data flow, or network activity is present in these snippets.\n- The function name suggests it is related to data annotation, possibly in bioinformatics, but that alone doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a straightforward import statement. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** There is no evidence of malware, malicious code, or suspicious activity in these snippets.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is apparent.\n- **Security risks:** The minimal code does not introduce any security risk on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-3, 5:\n- **Assessment:** These are identical in content and reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = high (0.9-1.0).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The import statement is benign and standard.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Slightly different, with a SecurityRisk score of 0.1 and confidence 0.8.\n- **Analysis:** The mention of a \"security risk\" of 0.1 seems unwarranted based solely on an import statement. Unless additional context suggests otherwise, this is an overestimation.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score should be 0, matching the other reports, unless there is external context indicating a concern.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- For such minimal import code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The only exception is report 4, which assigns 0.1. Given the lack of evidence, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- The code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, data flow, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The risk score should be 0, as there's no security concern here.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Update report 4:** Lower the security risk score from 0.1 to 0.\n- **Overall:** All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is standard, harmless, and presents no security concern. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero except for confidence levels that are high.",
