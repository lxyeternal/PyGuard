  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "This is a single import statement that imports a function from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this line. Without additional context or code, it cannot be determined if the imported function is malicious. The import is standard practice in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk. It appears to be a normal import of a function from a local module.",
