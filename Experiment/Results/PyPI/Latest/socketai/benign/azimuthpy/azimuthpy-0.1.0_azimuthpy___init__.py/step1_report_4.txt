  "purpose": "Import a function named annotate_adata_azimuth from a local module called python_wrapper, likely for annotation or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed; import statement does not process data at runtime",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a specific function from a local module. There are no parameters, data processing, or external network calls shown. As a minimal import, it does not pose a security risk on its own. Without additional context or implementation details of the imported function, there are no indications of malicious behavior or code sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger project that uses the imported function.",
