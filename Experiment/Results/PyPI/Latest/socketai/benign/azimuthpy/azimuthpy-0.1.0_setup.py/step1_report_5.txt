{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'azimuthpy' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; package dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink operations such as network communication, file writing, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads external files and lists dependencies but does not process untrusted input or data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without validation; minimal code complexity; no suspicious or obfuscated patterns; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of 'open' to read a README file is common, although it does not include error handling, which is typical in simple setup scripts. No network operations, data leakage, or unsafe code practices are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python project.",
