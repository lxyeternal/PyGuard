{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; specifies dependencies like 'anndata', 'numpy', 'pandas', 'rpy2'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no network, system modifications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' to assign long description; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; use of open() without error handling is typical but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All dependencies are standard open-source packages. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code reads a local file for documentation, which is common practice. No suspicious data flows or external inputs are involved. The lack of error handling for file reading is a minor issue but not security-related. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
