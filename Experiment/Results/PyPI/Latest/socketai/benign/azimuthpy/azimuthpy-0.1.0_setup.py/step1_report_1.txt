{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'azimuthpy' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'long_description=open('README.md').read()'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, reading 'README.md' could be manipulated if the file contents are malicious, but in typical use, this is just reading local documentation. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'README.md' content during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup.py practices; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' content directly, but this is a common pattern and unlikely to be malicious unless the file itself is compromised. No code injection, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, security issues, or suspicious behavior detected.",
