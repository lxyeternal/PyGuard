  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'azimuthpy' that wraps Azimuth functionality using rpy2.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "The 'open' function reads the README.md content, which is used in package metadata; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without error handling is standard for setup scripts but can be considered a minimal anomaly; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads a README.md file to populate the long description and specifies dependencies. No external inputs or untrusted data handling beyond reading a local file are observed. The dependencies listed are common and benign. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be benign, standard, and without malicious intent. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
