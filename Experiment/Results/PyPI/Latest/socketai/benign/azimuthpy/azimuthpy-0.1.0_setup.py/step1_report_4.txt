  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'azimuthpy' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content into long_description during setup, which is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and package discovery methods. The only file read is 'README.md' for description content, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious activity observed. Usage of external dependencies appears legitimate and benign within this context.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is conventional and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is a straightforward package configuration without suspicious elements.",
