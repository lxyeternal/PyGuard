{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'azimuthpy'. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'README.md' file for long description, and the parameters passed to the setup() function for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks are the reading of 'README.md' (for long description), and the package installation process which could include malicious dependencies if they were malicious, but here dependencies are standard open-source packages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file into the 'long_description' parameter, and from the 'install_requires' list into the package installer, but nothing indicates malicious data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. The code uses standard setup practices; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup.py file. It reads the 'README.md' for the long description and specifies dependencies required for the package. All dependencies are publicly available and well-known. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reading of a README file is standard practice, and no external or untrusted input sources are used dynamically. The code does not contain any obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The structure and content are straightforward and align with common packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
