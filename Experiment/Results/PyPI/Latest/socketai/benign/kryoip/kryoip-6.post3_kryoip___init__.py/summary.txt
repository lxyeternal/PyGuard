  "conclusion": "The code is a benign IP utility toolkit with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the potential misuse of DNS and ping functions if inputs are malicious, but in its current form, it poses minimal risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
