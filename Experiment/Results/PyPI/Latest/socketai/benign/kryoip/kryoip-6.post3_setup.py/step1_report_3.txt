{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'kryoip'.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata fields such as name, version, author, email, description, and URL. Reads 'README.md' content for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read is used insecurely or sent elsewhere; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata and description data flow from source variables and file read into the package configuration. No untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes standard setuptools functions for packaging. It reads the long description from a local file, which is typical. No user input, environment variables, or network activity is involved. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard practices without any anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script for packaging a library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
