  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup to populate long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without try-except, but this is common in setup scripts; no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md for long_description, which is standard. No code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code performs a typical setup configuration without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
