  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'kryoip', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup and passing package metadata for installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling is common in setup scripts, but no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python requirements. It reads 'README.md' for long description content, which is standard practice. No user input, environment variables, or external network connections are involved. The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply prepares the package for distribution with provided metadata.",
