  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'kryoip' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading 'README.md' for description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file to set a long description, which is standard practice. No input/output from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The package configuration appears typical for a Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
