  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description during setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' into long_description; no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without exception handling, but common in setup scripts; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The minor concern about file handling is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
