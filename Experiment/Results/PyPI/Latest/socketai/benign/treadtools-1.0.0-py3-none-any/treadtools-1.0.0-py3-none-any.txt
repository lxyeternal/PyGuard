      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but employs insecure practices such as deprecated pip usage and dynamic script execution without validation. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is moderate (~0.6), primarily due to potential exploitation of insecure execution methods. The malware score remains 0. Overall, the code should be refactored for security, but it does not pose an active malicious threat."

      "obfuscated": 1,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not traditional source code but a heavily obfuscated or corrupted binary archive with embedded filenames and signatures. The high obfuscation and embedded archive signatures strongly suggest potential malicious payloads or sabotage. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence, indicating a high suspicion of malicious intent that warrants further investigation and cautious handling."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit complex and partially obfuscated, data analysis and visualization tool used in medical device safety monitoring. The primary security concern is unsafe code practices like eval/exec, which could be exploited if unvalidated data is processed. No evidence of malware such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is detected. The current scoring in the reports is appropriate and consistent with the observed code characteristics. Further dynamic testing and input validation are recommended to mitigate potential risks."
