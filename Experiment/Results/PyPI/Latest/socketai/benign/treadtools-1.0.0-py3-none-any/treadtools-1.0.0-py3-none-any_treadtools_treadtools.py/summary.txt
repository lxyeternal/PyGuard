  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit complex and partially obfuscated, data analysis and visualization tool used in medical device safety monitoring. The primary security concern is unsafe code practices like eval/exec, which could be exploited if unvalidated data is processed. No evidence of malware such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is detected. The current scoring in the reports is appropriate and consistent with the observed code characteristics. Further dynamic testing and input validation are recommended to mitigate potential risks."
