  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but employs insecure practices such as deprecated pip usage and dynamic script execution without validation. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is moderate (~0.6), primarily due to potential exploitation of insecure execution methods. The malware score remains 0. Overall, the code should be refactored for security, but it does not pose an active malicious threat."
