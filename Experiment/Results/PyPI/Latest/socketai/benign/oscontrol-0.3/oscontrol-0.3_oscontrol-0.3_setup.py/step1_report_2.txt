{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static values within setup() parameters (name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, classifiers). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, such as network operations or file writes, are present in this setup script.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows or untrusted input processing occurs in this script.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' field specifies an exact Python version '==3.13', which is unusual because it restricts installation to a very specific Python release. This could cause deployment issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses it to define package metadata. All values are hardcoded string literals and parameters. There are no external inputs, environment variable usages, or dynamic code executions. The version restriction to Python 3.13 is unconventional but not malicious. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a straightforward package configuration script with no signs of malicious intent. Its primary concern is the restrictive Python version specification, which is unusual but not malicious. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
