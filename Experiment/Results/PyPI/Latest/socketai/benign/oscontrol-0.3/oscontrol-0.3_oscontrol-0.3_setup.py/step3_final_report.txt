  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution of the 'oscontrol' library.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, include_package_data, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input sinks are present; the script is static and purely declarative.",
  "flows": "The setup() call uses static metadata; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' is set to '==3.13', referencing an unreleased Python version, which is unusual and may cause installation issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools with typical metadata. The only anomaly is the 'python_requires' set to '==3.13', which is not an officially released Python version as of October 2023. The script contains no dynamic code, external input, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero, and the risk score should be very low (~0.1-0.2) due to the configuration anomaly but not a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script. The only concern is the 'python_requires' set to an unreleased Python version, which could cause deployment issues but does not constitute malicious activity or security risk. All reports are consistent in their assessment, and the scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a minimal risk score.",
