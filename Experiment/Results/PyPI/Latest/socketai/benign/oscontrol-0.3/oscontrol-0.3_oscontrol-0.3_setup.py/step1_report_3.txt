{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools and find_packages; setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "None present; no code execution or data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Imports -> setup() call with package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; the code appears standard and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools from setuptools and calls setup() with typical package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. The only potentially unusual aspect is specifying 'python_requires' as '==3.13', which may prevent installation on other Python versions but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data input, dynamic code, or suspicious logic is present. The structure and content align with common Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package metadata and requirements, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
