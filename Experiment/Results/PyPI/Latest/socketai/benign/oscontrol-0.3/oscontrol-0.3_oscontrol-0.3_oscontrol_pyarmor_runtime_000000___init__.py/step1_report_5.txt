{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime component, likely used for code obfuscation or protection.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only a module import is performed.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious or malicious code actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module importing __pyarmor__ from a relative package, with a comment indicating it is part of Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The purpose appears to be related to code protection or obfuscation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement associated with Pyarmor, a known code obfuscation tool. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
