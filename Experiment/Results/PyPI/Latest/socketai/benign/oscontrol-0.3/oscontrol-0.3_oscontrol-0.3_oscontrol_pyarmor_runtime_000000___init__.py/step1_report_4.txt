{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the local pyarmor_runtime package, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Import of __pyarmor__ as a module, no data flow involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version info and trial expiration date comment; no suspicious code or obfuscated patterns. The code is minimal and standard for licensing runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, with a comment indicating it's related to Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial version. No input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs. The context suggests this is part of a licensing or obfuscation runtime, not malicious code. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an import for runtime licensing or obfuscation handling within the Pyarmor framework. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
