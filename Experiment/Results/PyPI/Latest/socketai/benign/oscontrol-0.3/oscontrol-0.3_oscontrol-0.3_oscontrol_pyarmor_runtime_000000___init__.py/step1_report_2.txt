  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a local module __pyarmor_runtime__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leakage or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating usage of Pyarmor 9.0.6 (trial), which may suggest obfuscation or licensing mechanisms. The presence of version info and timestamp could be suspicious if misused, but in isolation, this appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a single module related to Pyarmor, a tool used for code obfuscation and licensing enforcement. No malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The comment suggests the environment is obfuscated or protected using Pyarmor, which is common in protected Python distributions. No anomalies beyond typical use of Pyarmor are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of an obfuscated or protected Python script using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
