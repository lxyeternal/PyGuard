{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; import statements are generally safe unless the imported module performs malicious actions upon import",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; the module import may execute code in __pyarmor__ upon import but does not process untrusted input directly",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating trial version and expiration date; no suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single import statement. The comment references Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool, with version and expiration info. The import likely loads a runtime component for obfuscation or licensing management. No code execution, data processing, or network activity is present. The code appears benign, serving a protected script or environment.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a straightforward import of a runtime module associated with Pyarmor obfuscation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
