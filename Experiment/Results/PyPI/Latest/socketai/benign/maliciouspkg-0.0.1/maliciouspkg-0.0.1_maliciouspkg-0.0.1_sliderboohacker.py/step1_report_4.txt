{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with a binary located at /flag, reads a math question from it, computes an answer, and sends it back to retrieve the output, presumably a flag.",
  "sources": "Reading output from /flag process via proc.stdout.readline(), reading entire output with proc.stdout.read(), and reading input from the process's stdout and stderr streams.",
  "sinks": "Writing the computed answer to /flag's stdin via proc.stdin.write(), potentially allowing injection if the question parsing is manipulated.",
  "flows": "The question string read from /flag is parsed with a regex, the answer is computed, then sent back to /flag via stdin, and the output is read back from the process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code simply interacts with an external process. No obfuscation or unusual language features. The process interaction appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script launches an external binary (/flag), reads a math question, parses it using regex, computes the answer, sends the answer back, and reads the output. The code does not execute untrusted code or data; it relies on the external process for logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks within this code. Its behavior appears consistent with a challenge or CTF environment where the binary challenges the script to compute the answer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper for an external binary challenge, with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It performs expected interactions and parsing. The security risk is minimal; however, if the external binary is compromised, the overall security could be impacted, but based solely on this code, there are no malicious indicators.",
