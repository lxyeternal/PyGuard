{
  "purpose": "Automates interaction with a binary located at /flag, solving a math question and submitting the answer to retrieve a flag.",
  "sources": "Reads the output line from /flag which contains the math question.",
  "sinks": "Writes the computed answer to /flag's stdin to receive the output.",
  "flows": "Reads question from /flag -> Parses the question -> Calculates answer -> Sends answer to /flag -> Reads full output including flag.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; straightforward subprocess interaction. No unusual code behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script spawns a process at /flag, reads a math question, parses it with regex, computes the answer, and writes it back to the process. No external data is processed, and no data leaks or malicious network activity is evident. The process appears to be a challenge binary designed to accept input and provide a flag upon correct answer. The code structure is simple, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated logic. The regular expression accurately extracts the expected format, and the flow is linear and controlled. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign automation script designed to interact with a challenge binary to obtain a flag. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks beyond standard subprocess handling. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
