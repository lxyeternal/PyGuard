{
  "purpose": "The script interacts with an external binary (/flag) to solve a math question and retrieve a flag.",
  "sources": "Reads from subprocess stdout (the math question), and writes to subprocess stdin (the answer).",
  "sinks": "Writes the computed answer to /flag's stdin; reads the output from /flag's stdout.",
  "flows": "Input (math question) -> parsing -> computation -> answer sent to /flag's stdin -> output received from /flag -> combined output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to execute a binary at '/flag', which may be a protected or sensitive binary. No obvious malicious code or backdoors in the script itself. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. Regular expression used for parsing is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code launches a binary located at '/flag' and interacts with it by reading a question, parsing it with regex, computing an answer, and sending it back. The interaction pattern is typical for a challenge or CTF environment. No suspicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. The use of subprocess with a binary at a specific path suggests it is part of a challenge or controlled environment. No malicious activity, backdoors, or credential theft evident. The code appears to be a controlled interaction with a known binary, not executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward automation to solve a math question posed by an external binary and retrieve a result or flag. No malicious intent or malicious code behavior detected. The use of subprocess with a known binary at '/flag' is typical for challenge environments. No security risks or malware are present in this code fragment.",
