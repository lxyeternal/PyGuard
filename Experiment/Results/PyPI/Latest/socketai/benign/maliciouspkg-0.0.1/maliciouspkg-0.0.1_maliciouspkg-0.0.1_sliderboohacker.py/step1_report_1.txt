{
  "purpose": "Automates interaction with a binary located at /flag, solving a math question and submitting the answer to retrieve a flag or output.",
  "sources": "Reads the initial math question from the subprocess's stdout; reads the output after submitting the answer.",
  "sinks": "Writes the answer to the subprocess's stdin, potentially affecting the behavior of the /flag binary.",
  "flows": "Reads question -> parses numbers -> computes answer -> writes answer to subprocess -> reads output from subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to interact with a binary; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script interacts with an external binary (/flag) which outputs a math question. It correctly parses the question with regex, performs the calculation, and submits the answer. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and solely to facilitate automated solving of a challenge binary. No suspicious or malicious code is present, and the flow seems intentional for a challenge environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple automation script for interacting with a challenge binary. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No security risks are evident beyond typical subprocess interactions in controlled environments.",
