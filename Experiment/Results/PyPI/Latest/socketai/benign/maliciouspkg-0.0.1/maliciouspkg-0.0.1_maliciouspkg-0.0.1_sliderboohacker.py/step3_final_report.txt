  "purpose": "Automates interaction with an external challenge binary at /flag, solving a math question and submitting the answer to retrieve a flag.",
  "sources": "Reads output from /flag's stdout (the math question), reads input to /flag's stdin (the answer).",
  "sinks": "Writes the computed answer to /flag's stdin; reads output from /flag's stdout, which may include the flag.",
  "flows": "Reads question from /flag stdout -> parses question -> computes answer -> writes answer to /flag stdin -> reads remaining output from /flag stdout.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward subprocess interaction, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code launches an external binary at /flag, reads a math question, parses it with regex, computes the answer, and sends it back. It then reads the output, likely containing the flag. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The interaction relies on the assumption that /flag is trustworthy. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or secrets. The regex parsing is appropriate for the expected format. The subprocess calls are standard and safe in a controlled environment. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign automation for challenge binary interaction, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only external dependency is the /flag binary, which, if compromised, could pose a risk outside this code's scope. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
