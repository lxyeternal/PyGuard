{
  "purpose": "Automates interaction with a binary located at /flag, solving a math challenge to retrieve a flag or output.",
  "sources": "Reads the first line of output from /flag (the math question), reads the rest of the output after sending the answer.",
  "sinks": "Writes the computed answer to /flag's stdin, reads output from /flag, potentially exposing sensitive output.",
  "flows": "Receives question from /flag -> parses question -> computes answer -> sends answer to /flag -> reads remaining output.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward subprocess interaction, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with a local binary (/flag) that outputs a math question. It correctly parses the question, computes the answer, and sends it back. No untrusted external input sources, network operations, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. Its purpose appears to be solving a challenge-response mechanism to retrieve a flag. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an automated solver for a challenge binary, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles subprocess communication without malicious behavior.",
