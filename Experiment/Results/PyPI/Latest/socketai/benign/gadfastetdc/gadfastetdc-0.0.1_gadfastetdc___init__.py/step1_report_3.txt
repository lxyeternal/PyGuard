  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper around etcd3 key-value store with REST API endpoints for get/set operations, and updates application settings based on stored config.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from etcd key-value store via the get() method.",
  "sinks": "json.loads(config) in get(), json.dumps(config) in set(), self.client.put() for writing data.",
  "flows": "Input from etcd via get() -> parsed by json.loads -> possibly used to update settings in refresh(); data from API input -> set() -> stored in etcd via json.dumps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network behavior, no obfuscated code, no unusual data handling. The URL is split by ':' without validation, but this is standard parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an etcd3 client with a provided URL, which is split into host and port. It exposes GET and PUT API endpoints to retrieve and store configuration data in etcd, and updates the settings object accordingly. The JSON data is safely parsed and stored. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The code relies on standard libraries and the etcd3 client without any suspicious modifications. The only minor concern is lack of validation on the URL format, but it doesn't pose malicious risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a configuration management API using etcd3 and FastAPI. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It functions as intended for configuration retrieval and update, with no evident security risks.",
