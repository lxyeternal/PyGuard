  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration interface for etcd with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use with minor robustness considerations."
