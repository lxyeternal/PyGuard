  "purpose": "This script is used to configure the packaging and installation requirements for a Python project named 'gadfastetdc'.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements from 'requirements.txt' and the content of 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to code execution or data leakage.",
  "flows": "The requirements and README content flow from files into variables used in setup(), with no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; standard setup script with straightforward file reads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, reads dependencies from a local file, and configures package metadata. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input beyond file reading. The code appears to be a typical setup.py script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python packaging setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
