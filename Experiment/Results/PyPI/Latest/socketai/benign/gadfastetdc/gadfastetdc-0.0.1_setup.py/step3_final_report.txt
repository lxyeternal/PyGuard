  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads dependencies from requirements.txt and long description from README.md, then calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files using open()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code or network operations",
  "flows": "File reading flows from open() to variables used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without explicit error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads dependencies and description from local files without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minor concern about lack of error handling in file reading is common and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects typical file reading without error handling, which is acceptable in this context. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
