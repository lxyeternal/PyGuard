  "flows": "No data flows within this single line of code; no data processing or transfer observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the import appears straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, bringing in RaceData from a module likely used elsewhere in the project. No inputs, outputs, or data flows are present within this line. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident. The import could be used for legitimate purposes such as data analysis, reporting, or other processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
