{
  "purpose": "The code processes race data by reading driver info, start and end times from local files, validates formats with regex, manages errors, and generates textual reports.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'abbreviations.txt', 'start.log', 'end.log' files; uses regex to parse data; accesses '__file__' for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs reports via print statements; logs errors into Record.errors; no external network or system commands involved.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> validates data with regex -> stores in Record objects -> sets start/end times -> generates reports -> prints output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Error handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, regex validation, data encapsulation, and reporting. Error handling is appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The logic is straightforward, with proper validation and error logging. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent, and well-structured race data processing module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
