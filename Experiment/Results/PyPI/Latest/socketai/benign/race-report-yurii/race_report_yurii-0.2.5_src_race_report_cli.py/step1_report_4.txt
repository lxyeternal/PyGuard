  "purpose": "The script is designed to analyze F1 race data, load race information from a specified directory, and display driver details or a race report based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for path, order, and driver name; loads data via RaceData class; user input is taken from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting driver info or race report; no untrusted data output to external systems or network; data processed locally.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> get_cli_arguments() -> main() -> RaceData methods -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Usage of standard libraries and clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code parses input arguments securely, loads data via a class (assumed to handle internal data safely), and outputs information based on conditions. No evidence of data leakage, external network communication, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious code flow or obfuscation. Usage of RaceData class might internally have vulnerabilities, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a race data analysis CLI tool with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It reads input parameters, loads race data, and displays information, all in a straightforward manner. No signs of malware or security issues are evident in this code snippet.",
