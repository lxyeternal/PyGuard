{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for analyzing F1 race data, loading data from specified files, and displaying driver info or reports based on user input.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (path, order, driver name); RaceData object loading data from the specified path.",
  "sinks": "Printing output to console; potentially using data from RaceData methods.",
  "flows": "User provides arguments -> get_cli_arguments() parses them -> main() creates RaceData object -> loads data -> depending on driver argument, fetches info or prints report -> outputs are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code mostly handles user input and displays data.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse to process user inputs for file paths and options, then creates a RaceData object to load and retrieve race data. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or handling of untrusted data beyond standard input parsing. The functions called from RaceData are external, but based solely on this script, no malicious or suspicious code is present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Overall, the code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for race data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard command-line interface for race data analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this code alone. It reads user input, processes it, and outputs data securely. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
