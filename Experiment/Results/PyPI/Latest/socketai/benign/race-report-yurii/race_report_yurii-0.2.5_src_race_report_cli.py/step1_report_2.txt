{
  "purpose": "Command-line interface for analyzing F1 race data, loading race information from specified directory, and displaying driver info or report.",
  "sources": "argparse arguments (path, order, driver), RaceData class methods (load_data, get_driver_info, print_report)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output involves untrusted sources directly or unsafe data handling",
  "flows": "User input (arguments) -> RaceData methods -> output display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns detected; straightforward argument parsing and data display",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to specify data directory, sorting order, and optional driver name. It creates a RaceData object, loads data, and conditionally displays driver info or a report. The data flow involves reading user inputs and passing them to class methods, with no untrusted data directly affecting system behavior or executing code. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI script for data processing and display, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external RaceData class for data handling, which appears to be a normal data management class without malicious intent.",
