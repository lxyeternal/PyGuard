{
  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for race data analysis, parsing user arguments and displaying race or driver info.",
  "sources": "User input arguments via argparse; data loaded from files specified by --path.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via print; no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed -> RaceData object created -> data loaded -> driver info retrieved or report printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that interacts with an external RaceData class. It securely parses arguments, loads data, and displays information without executing untrusted code or network activity. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard CLI utility for race data analysis with no malicious or security concerns based solely on this code snippet. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
