  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for analyzing F1 race data, including loading data, retrieving driver info, and printing reports.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (path, order, driver name). Uses RaceData class to load and process race data.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods on RaceData object to load data and retrieve driver info. Outputs information via print statements.",
  "flows": "User input (CLI args) → RaceData methods (load_data, get_driver_info) → Output via print",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments securely using argparse. It safely passes parameters to the RaceData class without processing untrusted input directly in a dangerous manner. All data flows from user input to class methods with output via standard print statements, which is typical for CLI tools. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The only external interaction is reading data files specified by the user, which is necessary for functionality. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for race data analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No indicators of malware or malicious code found.",
