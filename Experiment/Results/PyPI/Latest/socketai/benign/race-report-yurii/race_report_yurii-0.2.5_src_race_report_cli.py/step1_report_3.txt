{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for analyzing and displaying F1 race data from specified files.",
  "sources": "User provides command-line arguments: --path for data files, --order for sorting, and --driver for specific driver info.",
  "sinks": "Data from user input can influence data retrieval and display; no untrusted data directly affects sensitive system functions.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed and passed to RaceData methods; user input controls which data is retrieved and how it's displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script parses CLI arguments securely using argparse. It instantiates a RaceData object with a user-specified path and calls methods to load data and retrieve driver info if requested. Data is displayed in a controlled manner. There are no network calls, code injections, or system modifications. The code uses standard libraries and well-structured logic. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for race data analysis. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on external RaceData implementation, which is not provided here, but based on this code alone, there are no security concerns.",
