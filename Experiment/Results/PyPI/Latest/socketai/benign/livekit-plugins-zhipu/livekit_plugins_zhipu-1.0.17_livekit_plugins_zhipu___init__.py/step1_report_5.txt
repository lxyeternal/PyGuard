{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a plugin class for a larger system, importing modules, setting metadata, and registering the plugin.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.llm, .version, .log) and external module (livekit.agents). No user input or external data read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or sensitive information leakage. No network, file, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow. The code mainly initializes and registers a plugin object without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The plugin registration pattern is typical for extensible systems.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and modules, defines a plugin class inheriting from a base Plugin, and registers it. It also manages documentation metadata. All operations are straightforward initialization and registration steps without data manipulation or external interactions. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin definition and registration without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears benign, with no security risks or malware indications.",
