  "purpose": "Define and register a plugin class for livekit agents, and manage module documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules and external Plugin class; class instantiation; registration method.",
  "sinks": "Potential registration method call (Plugin.register_plugin) that could execute the class logic; no other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Import of Plugin class -> Creation of ZhipuPlugin instance -> Registration call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious code flows detected. The cleanup of module doc comments is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules and external plugin class, then defines a plugin subclass with an init method that calls the parent constructor with module info and a logger. It registers the plugin class. The cleanup of module documentation is standard. No untrusted data input or suspicious behavior appears. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard plugin setup and registration without malicious intent or security issues. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks.",
