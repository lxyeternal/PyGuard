  "purpose": "Implement a Python client for interacting with an LLM API, managing API keys via environment variables, streaming responses, and handling errors.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API key, input parameters for API requests, user input from chat context.",
  "sinks": "API request payloads, streamed responses, logging of user queries.",
  "flows": "API key sourced from environment variables or parameters → API request payload → streamed response handling → logging user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Logging user input could pose privacy concerns but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard practices for API key management via environment variables, streams responses from the API, and handles errors appropriately. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The data flow from environment variables or parameters into API requests and responses is typical. Logging user input is a privacy consideration but not malicious. No backdoors, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of an LLM API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is privacy due to logging user queries, which is a common practice but should be monitored. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor privacy considerations.",
