  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages API keys via environment variables, streams responses, handles errors, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns, standard API interaction.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to potential data exposure via logging).\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound; no malicious behavior detected. The low security risk mainly relates to logging sensitive data, which is common but should be monitored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard API usage, environment variables, and logging user queries.\n- **Findings:** No secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation, potential privacy concern in logging.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the main concern is privacy in logs, not security breach.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client with streaming, environment variable API key, logging user input.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, logging could leak sensitive data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, no obfuscation, risk mainly privacy-related.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Wraps OpenAI API, uses environment variables, no malicious code.\n- **Findings:** No secrets embedded, standard practices, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, with privacy considerations in logging.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—API wrapper, environment variables, streaming, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, standard API usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a typical API client wrapper, with no signs of backdoors, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation or unusual code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (around 0.2) mainly due to potential privacy issues in logging user queries, but this is not a security breach.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight concern over logging user data, but overall low.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client for interacting with an LLM API, following standard security practices (e.g., environment variables for secrets). No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with minimal security risk primarily related to privacy (logging user input). No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.",
