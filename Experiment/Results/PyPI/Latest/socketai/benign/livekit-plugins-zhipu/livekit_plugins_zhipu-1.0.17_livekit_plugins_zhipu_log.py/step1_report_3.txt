  "purpose": "Initialize a logger instance named 'livekit.plugins.zhipu' for logging purposes within a plugin or module.",
  "sources": "getLogger function from the logging module, with the argument 'livekit.plugins.zhipu'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially where the logger outputs logs; however, in this snippet, no actual logging calls are made.",
  "flows": "N/A – no logging or data flow occurs in this snippet beyond logger creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward logger instantiation with a static name.",
  "analysis": "The code imports getLogger from the logging module and creates a logger object with a specific name. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The code is minimal and standard for setting up logging. No further context suggests malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious code and appears safe.",
