  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the getLogger function from the logging module and creates a logger with a specific name. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs. This is a common pattern in Python for setting up logging and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving solely to set up logging. No malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident.",
