  "purpose": "Initialize a logger with the name 'livekit.plugins.zhipu' for logging within a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import 'getLogger' from the 'logging' library and the string argument passed to 'getLogger'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for logging setup; no unusual or suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'getLogger' function from the 'logging' module and creates a logger instance named 'livekit.plugins.zhipu'. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing shown. The code appears to be a typical logging setup without any malicious behavior. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present, and the code snippet is too minimal to suggest any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not pose any threat or suspicious activity.",
