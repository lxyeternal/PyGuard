  "purpose": "Set up a logger for the 'livekit.plugins.zhipu' module to record log messages.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output destinations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flows from source to sink within this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard logging library functions; no suspicious patterns or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the getLogger function from the logging module and creates a logger instance named 'livekit.plugins.zhipu'. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no dangerous operations. The code appears to be a typical setup for logging within a Python application. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are detected. The snippet is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not read untrusted data, perform any network activity, or contain suspicious logic.",
