  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static assignment, no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a fixed string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no input, output, dynamic execution, or external data. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
