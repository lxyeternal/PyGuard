  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or complex logic involved. This is standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:  \nNo report indicates any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is minimal, static, and typical for version declarations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \nNo errors or flaws are present in the reports. They uniformly agree that this is benign.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:  \nSince the code is just a static assignment, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No change is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
