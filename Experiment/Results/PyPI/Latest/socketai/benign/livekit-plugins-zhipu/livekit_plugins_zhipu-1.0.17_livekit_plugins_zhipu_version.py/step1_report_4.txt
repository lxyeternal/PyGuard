  "anomalies": "Single line assigning a version string; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__. It is a standard practice for Python packages to specify their version using such a variable. No external input, data processing, or dynamic execution is present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for Python package version declaration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
