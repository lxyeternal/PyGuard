  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for a vCard 4.0 parser and generator, allowing other modules or scripts to import Contact classes and error handling utilities.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from a local module named 'pythonvCard4'. It does not read external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points in this snippet where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet, as it only contains import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The module appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from a local module, indicating modular design. It exposes these components via __all__ for controlled external access. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The comments suggest the purpose is to handle vCard 4.0 data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a simple, standard module initialization with safe import/export practices. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided content.",
