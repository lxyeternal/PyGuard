{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for a vCard 4.0 parser and generator, importing classes and variables from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the relative module '.pythonvCard4'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and exposes certain classes and variables for external use; no data flow analysis is meaningful here as there are no data processing or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal and standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module interface with an import statement and an export list (__all__). It does not perform any processing, network communication, or file I/O. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscations, or hidden behaviors. The code's purpose is to define what symbols are publicly accessible from this package. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign module interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports classes and variables from a local module, serving as part of a vCard parser/generator library.",
