{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for parsing and generating vCard 4.0 data according to RFC6350.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes and variables from a relative module '.pythonvCard4'. No external data sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that handle untrusted input or sensitive data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are visible in this snippet; it primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package module that defines and exports classes and constants related to vCard parsing. It uses relative import syntax which suggests it's part of a larger package. No external data handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports components from a submodule for external use.",
