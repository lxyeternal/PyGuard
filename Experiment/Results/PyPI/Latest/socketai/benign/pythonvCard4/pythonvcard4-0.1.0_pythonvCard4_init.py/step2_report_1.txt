  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, straightforward module that imports classes and variables from a local module and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No report identifies any dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- All reports confidently assess the code as benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** only contains an import statement and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data flows, no input/output, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are claimed or implied.\n\n### Scores and their justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is suggested.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious features mean that higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the existing scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**However,** to be thorough, I would assign the following scores if I were to set them independently:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
