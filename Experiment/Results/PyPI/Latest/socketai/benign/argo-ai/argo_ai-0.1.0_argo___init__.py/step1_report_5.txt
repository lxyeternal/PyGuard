  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but its specific purpose cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function arguments, or imported modules that read external data. Since the code is not provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or data outputs. Exact sinks cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs). Specific flows cannot be analyzed without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified in the absence of the code. The code could contain hidden or obfuscated segments, but none are apparent here.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient data; no code provided for analysis. Unable to evaluate source-to-sink flows, detect anomalies, or identify suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be assessed at this time.",
