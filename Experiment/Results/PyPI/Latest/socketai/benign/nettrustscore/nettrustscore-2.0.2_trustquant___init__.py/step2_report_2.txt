  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .nts import NTS\nfrom .cond_nts import CNTS\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is a minimal set of import statements, importing classes `NTS` and `CNTS` from local modules.\n- There is no executable logic, data flow, or external interaction.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger package structure.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward import, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import, no risks.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1.0`\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (`0.9`) and a small security risk (`0.1`) due to minimal suspicion.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `confidence=0.9`\n- **Analysis:** The slight risk score might be due to cautious reasoning, but given the code's simplicity, this is likely overly conservative.\n- **Recommendation:** I would suggest lowering the `securityRisk` to 0, as no actual suspicious behavior is present. The confidence is high, and no actual anomalies are observed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Assessment:** Fully appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Should reflect actual threat levels; since there's no malicious activity, all should be near zero, except perhaps a cautious note in report 4.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Adjust Report 4's `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0** — the evidence does not support any security concern.\n- **Maintain all other scores as they are.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The scores across reports are generally appropriate, with minor overcaution in report 4.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0 for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores for this code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign import statement. All reports correctly identify this, with a minor overestimation of risk in one case. I recommend lowering that risk score to zero for consistency.",
