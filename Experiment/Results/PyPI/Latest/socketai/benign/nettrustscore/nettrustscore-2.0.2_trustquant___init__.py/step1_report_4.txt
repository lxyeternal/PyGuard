  "purpose": "The code imports classes NTS and CNTS from local modules, likely part of a larger package, to be used within the package's functionality.",
  "sources": "The imports from .nts and .cond_nts indicate reading of module files within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes which will be used later in the package; no data flow or execution flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing classes from local modules. It does not execute any code or perform any data handling. The structure and format are standard for Python packages. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of normal package structure.",
