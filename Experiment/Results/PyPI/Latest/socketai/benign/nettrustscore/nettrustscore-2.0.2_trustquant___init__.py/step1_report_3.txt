  "purpose": "Import classes NTS and CNTS from local modules for use in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.nts and .cond_nts).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to absence of executable code; only imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for classes from local modules. There are no data inputs, no network calls, no environment variable usage, and no executable logic. The modules imported are likely part of a package or project structure. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
