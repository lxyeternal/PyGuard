  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The code snippet is:\n   ```python\n   from .nts import NTS\n   from .cond_nts import CNTS\n   ```\n   This is a straightforward import of classes `NTS` and `CNTS` from local modules `nts` and `cond_nts`. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious code, or data handling in this fragment.\n\n2. **Issue Presence**:  \n   - The reports confirm that the code only performs import statements.  \n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.  \n   - No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.  \n   - They appropriately note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n   - The only minor discrepancy is the slight variation in confidence scores and risk assessments, which are reasonable given the minimal context.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, aligning with the code's simplicity.  \n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0 or very close to 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.  \n   - The code is purely import statements with no malicious indicators.\n\n6. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior; the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly state that this is a benign import statement.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, mostly at 0 or near 0, reflecting benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
