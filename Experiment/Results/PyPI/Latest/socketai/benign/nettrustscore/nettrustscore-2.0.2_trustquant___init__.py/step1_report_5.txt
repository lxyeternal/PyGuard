{
  "purpose": "This code imports two classes, NTS and CNTS, from local modules nts and cond_nts, respectively, likely to be used within a larger project for certain functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (nts and cond_nts). No external data sources or user inputs are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing classes for internal use within the project; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative imports of two classes from local modules. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The minimal structure and standard import syntax indicate typical code organization. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports classes for use elsewhere in the project.",
