{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import classes or modules named 'NTS' and 'CNTS' from local files within a package, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local module files '.nts' and '.cond_nts' within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes or modules from local sources, which could then be used elsewhere; no flow of data or untrusted input is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing modules without any suspicious patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, referencing local modules with relative imports. It does not contain any logic, input handling, or data transmission. It does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. As it is only a fragment of a larger codebase, its context cannot be fully assessed, but on its own, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement for local modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign part of a larger project structure.",
