  "purpose": "The code imports classes NTS and CNTS from local modules nts and cond_nts respectively, likely for use within a larger application.",

  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this snippet; it's only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing classes from sibling modules. There is no execution, data handling, or suspicious activity in this fragment. Since it only involves standard import syntax, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as part of a larger codebase to include local classes. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based solely on these import statements.",
