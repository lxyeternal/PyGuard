{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes NTS and CNTS from local modules, serving as part of a package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.nts and .cond_nts).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statements do not create runtime data paths or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating a standard package structure. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. Slight overestimation of risk in one report (0.1) is acceptable but can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected, and the code does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments for consistency. Overall, the code is safe for use, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
