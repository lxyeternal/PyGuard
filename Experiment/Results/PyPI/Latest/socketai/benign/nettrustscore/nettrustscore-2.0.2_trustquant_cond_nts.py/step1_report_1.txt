{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class CNTS for computing trust scores, density estimations, and visualization related to model predictions, primarily for assessing prediction confidence and trustworthiness.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays 'oracle' and 'predictions'. Uses file I/O for saving plots ('trust_spectrum.png', 'conditional_trust_densities.png') via os.path.join and plt.savefig.",
  "sinks": "Saves plots to disk with plt.savefig. No other sinks identified. No external network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (oracle, predictions) flow into trust computation methods. Density and trust scores are computed via kernel density estimation. Visualizations are generated and saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious input/output handling. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and functions. Assertions and data validation are appropriate. No suspicious dynamic code execution, external network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for calculating trust scores and density estimates for model predictions, with visualization capabilities. All data flows are contained within the code, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The assertions and data validation enhance reliability, and no hidden or obfuscated logic is evident. The file I/O involves saving plots to disk, which is typical for visualization purposes. Overall, the code structure and logic do not indicate any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for trustworthiness analysis based on model predictions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It performs data validation, statistical estimation, and visualization without any suspicious or harmful activities.",
