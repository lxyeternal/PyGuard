{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for computing trust scores, densities, and trust spectrum visualizations for model predictions based on softmax outputs and true labels. It appears intended for model interpretability and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads model predictions (self.predictions), true labels (self.oracle), and environment via os.path (for saving plots).",
  "sinks": "Saves plots to './trust_spectrum.png' and './conditional_trust_densities.png' using matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.",
  "flows": "Processes prediction probabilities to compute trust scores, densities, and plots, then saves figures to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The use of os.path.join for saving plots is standard; no hardcoded secrets or hidden code observed. The code performs straightforward statistical computations without obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of input types and shapes, calculates trust scores based on model prediction confidence and correctness, and uses KernelDensity estimation to visualize trust distributions. All operations involve standard statistical and plotting procedures. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network connections, or other malicious activities are present. It strictly functions as a model evaluation tool with visualization outputs. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for trust score analysis and visualization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It solely relies on standard libraries and performs statistical visualization tasks.",
