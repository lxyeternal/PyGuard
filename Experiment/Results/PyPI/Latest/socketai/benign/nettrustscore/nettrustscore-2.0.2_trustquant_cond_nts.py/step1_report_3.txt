{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class CNTS for computing trust scores, densities, and normalized trust scores (NTS) based on model predictions and true labels. It includes methods for statistical analysis and visualization of trust distributions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes 'oracle' and 'predictions', which are assigned during initialization. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots are saved as PNG files to the local filesystem. No data is sent over networks or stored externally.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input arrays through trust computations, density estimations, and plotting functions. There is no evidence of untrusted data flow outside the class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code uses standard libraries and methods for statistical analysis and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, computes trust metrics based on model output probabilities, and visualizes distributions. It uses well-known techniques such as kernel density estimation without any suspicious modifications. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious functions are present. All methods appear to serve legitimate statistical and visualization purposes. The assertions and parameter checks ensure data integrity, and file saving operations are standard. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for trust analysis and visualization in a machine learning context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
