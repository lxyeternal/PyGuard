{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class CNTS for computing trust scores, density estimations, and visualizations based on model softmax predictions and true labels, primarily for interpretability and evaluation of model confidence.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays 'oracle' (true labels) and 'predictions' (softmax outputs).",
  "sinks": "Saves plots ('trust_spectrum.png', 'conditional_trust_densities.png') locally; no external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through trust score calculations and density estimations, culminating in saved visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, trust score computation, kernel density estimation, and plotting. It uses well-known libraries and straightforward logic. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The data handling is internal, with no external network calls or data leaks. The plots are saved locally with fixed filenames, which is typical for visualization tools. The input validation is thorough, and the overall structure is clear and standard for trustworthiness assessment in ML models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for trust analysis with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to file I/O but does not indicate any threat.",
