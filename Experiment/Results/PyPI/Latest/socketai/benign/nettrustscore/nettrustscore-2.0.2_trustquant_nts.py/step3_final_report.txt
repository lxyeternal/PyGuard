  "purpose": "The code computes trust scores for classifier predictions, estimates trust density using KDE, and optionally visualizes the trust spectrum through plots.",
  "sources": "Reads true labels ('oracle') and predicted probabilities ('predictions') as input data; uses numpy for data handling.",
  "sinks": "Saves a trust spectrum plot locally as 'trust_spectrum.png' using matplotlib; no network or external data transmission involved.",
  "flows": "Input validation -> trust score calculation -> KDE density estimation -> optional plotting -> output dictionary with trust scores.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; uses standard libraries; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of inputs, calculates trust scores per class based on correctness and confidence, estimates trust density via KDE, and visualizes the trust spectrum. It writes a plot image locally, which is benign. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common practices. No obfuscation or insecure operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation for trust scoring in machine learning models. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal file operation is standard and does not pose security risks. Therefore, the malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
