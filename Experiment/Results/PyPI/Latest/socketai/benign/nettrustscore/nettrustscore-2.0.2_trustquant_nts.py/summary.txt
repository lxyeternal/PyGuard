  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation for trust scoring in machine learning models. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal file operation is standard and does not pose security risks. Therefore, the malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0. The confidence in this assessment is high."
