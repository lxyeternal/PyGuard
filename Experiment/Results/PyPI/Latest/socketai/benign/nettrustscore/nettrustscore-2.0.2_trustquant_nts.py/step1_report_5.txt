{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for computing trust scores (NetTrustScore) for model predictions, using KDE for trust density estimation and optional plotting of trust spectrum.",
  "sources": "Reads data from numpy arrays (oracle, predictions), environment variables (via os.path), and matplotlib for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Saves plot images to local filesystem via plt.savefig, uses os.path.join for path construction.",
  "flows": "Processes input data to compute trust metrics, density estimation, and optionally generates and saves plots.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.join with a fixed path ('./trust_spectrum.png') is benign; no other anomalies like hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for data types, shapes, and value ranges. It computes trust scores based on model predictions versus true labels, applies KDE to estimate trust density, and optionally plots the trust spectrum. The plotting saves an image to local storage, which is a typical operation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behavior is present. The logic aligns with the described trust metric computation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for trust score analysis, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It performs data processing and visualization securely, with no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or harmful actions.",
