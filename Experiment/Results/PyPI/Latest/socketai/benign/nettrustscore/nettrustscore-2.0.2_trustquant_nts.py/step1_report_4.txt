{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for computing trust scores (NetTrustScore, NTS) for classifier predictions using Kernel Density Estimation, with optional visualization of trust spectrum.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'oracle' (true labels) and 'predictions' (model output probabilities).",
  "sinks": "The code writes an image file 'trust_spectrum.png' to the filesystem. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through trust score calculations, density estimations, optional plotting, and finally to returning trust scores as a dictionary. No untrusted data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Usage of external libraries is typical for data processing and visualization. No obfuscated code or malicious system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly validates input types and shapes, performs trust score calculations, applies KDE for density estimation, and optionally plots the trust spectrum. It writes an image file, which is a benign file operation. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The logic and structure are consistent with a legitimate trust scoring utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for computing and visualizing trust scores based on classifier confidence levels. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as a normal, security-aware analytical tool.",
