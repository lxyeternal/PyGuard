  "purpose": "The code defines a class for computing NetTrustScore (NTS) based on model predictions and true labels, with optional plotting of trust spectra.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'oracle' (true labels) and 'predictions' (model softmax outputs). It also reads configuration parameters (alpha, beta, trust_spectrum).",
  "sinks": "The code saves a trust spectrum plot to a file ('./trust_spectrum.png') using matplotlib. It performs no network communication, file system access beyond saving the plot, or other data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data (oracle and predictions) flow through trust calculation, density estimation, and optional plotting. The plotting function saves an image to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The plotting path is static but harmless. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation on input types and shapes, then calculates trust scores based on predictions and true labels. It uses Kernel Density Estimation to generate trust density curves per class, and optionally plots these curves. The computed trust scores are used to derive class-specific and overall NetTrustScores. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The plotting function saves an image locally without any malicious side effects. All data processing appears standard and intended for trust evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for trust score calculation and visualization. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply computes and visualizes trust metrics, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
