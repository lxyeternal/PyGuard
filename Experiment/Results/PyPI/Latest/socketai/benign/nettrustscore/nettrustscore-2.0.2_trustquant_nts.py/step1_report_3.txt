{
  "purpose": "This code implements a class for computing trust scores and trust density using kernel density estimation for model predictions, potentially for evaluating model reliability or robustness.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters (oracle, predictions), and uses os.path.join for file path construction in plotting function.",
  "sinks": "Saves a plot image to './trust_spectrum.png' via plt.savefig.",
  "flows": "Inputs (oracle, predictions) flow through trust score calculations, density estimation, optional plotting, and final dictionary output. The plot file path is constructed and saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.path.join with a fixed string './trust_spectrum.png' is typical; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code validates inputs rigorously, computes trust scores based on model predictions and true labels, and performs kernel density estimation to produce trust density curves. The plotting function generates visualizations and saves a PNG file. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution found. The data flow involves standard calculations for trust assessment, and file output is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard implementation of trust score evaluation using KDE.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate trust score computation and visualization process with no evidence of malicious behavior. It reads data, processes trust scores, and outputs a plot file locally. There are no hidden backdoors, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads.",
