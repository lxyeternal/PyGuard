  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the Python package 'nettrustscore' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling is common in setup scripts but could potentially be exploited if the file is maliciously replaced; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' directly without validation, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. No code execution, network access, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
