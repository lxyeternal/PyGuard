  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'nettrustscore' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no runtime data processing or external calls",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static setup script without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure without obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. It reads the README.md file to populate the long description, which is common practice. No user input, network calls, or code execution from untrusted sources are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution or contain obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script adheres to best practices for package setup.",
