  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script. Minor note: open() used without error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script utilizing setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a README file without error handling but this is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. Multiple expert reviews concur that the code is benign, with scores indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices support a conclusion of safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. All reports and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
