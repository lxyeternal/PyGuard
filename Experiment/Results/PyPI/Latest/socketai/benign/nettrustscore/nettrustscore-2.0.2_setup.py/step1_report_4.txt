  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python project 'nettrustscore'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setting package parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'open' to read a file without exception handling; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging. It imports setup and find_packages from setuptools. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other distribution info. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical and not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, external network interactions, or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard packaging script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks without any malicious or suspicious code.",
