{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'terraform-runner' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from package metadata fields, dependencies list ('requests'), and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform actions that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only sets up package metadata and dependencies without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided setup.py is a typical package configuration script with no suspicious or malicious elements. The reports are empty, indicating no detected issues or claims. The code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. Given the absence of evidence, the package appears benign. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be set to zero, reflecting no detected threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The empty reports do not suggest any concerns. Therefore, the package can be considered safe based on the current information.",
