  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package named \"terraform-runner.\"\n   - It specifies basic package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n   - There are no apparent malicious or suspicious code snippets.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n2. **Reports Content:**\n   - All five reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no additional details.\n   - No specific issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are described.\n\n3. **Issues in the Reports:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, they do not provide any evidence or reasoning about potential vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n   - The absence of details prevents any meaningful assessment or validation of claims.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Without concrete information, assigning high malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The lack of evidence suggests that the package does not exhibit malicious behavior based on the provided data.\n   - The reports do not contain any assumptions or claims to challenge.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - Given the data, the package appears benign.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports do not indicate any issues, vulnerabilities, or malware.\n   - I would assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no signs of obfuscation)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to lack of information, but no apparent issues)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is standard and appears safe.\n- The reports do not provide any evidence to suggest otherwise.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the current information.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nPlease ensure future reports include detailed findings for more accurate assessments.",
