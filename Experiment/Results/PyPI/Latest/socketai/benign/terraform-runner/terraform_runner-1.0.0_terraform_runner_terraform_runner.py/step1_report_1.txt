{
  "purpose": "The script automates Terraform infrastructure deployment and sends notifications via Telegram during each step.",
  "sources": "Environment variables TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID, subprocess outputs, and function inputs.",
  "targets": "Telegram API endpoint, subprocess commands, and outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read for credentials, subprocess runs execute Terraform commands, and send_telegram_message transmits status updates via the network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables for tokens, which is common; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No suspicious network activity observed beyond legitimate API requests. The subprocess commands and environment variable handling are standard, and no malicious code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard deployment automation script that manages Terraform operations and uses Telegram API for notifications. It reads sensitive credentials from environment variables, which is typical. The subprocess commands run Terraform CLI without user input, and the only network activity is legitimate API calls to Telegram. There are retries with delays for robustness. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscated or misleading code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate deployment automation tool with no malicious intent or security risks. It manages infrastructure deployment with notification capabilities, adhering to common patterns. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
