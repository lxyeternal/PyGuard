{
  "purpose": "The code automates Terraform deployment steps (init, plan, apply, output retrieval) and sends status updates via Telegram API, using environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID; subprocess calls executing 'terraform' commands; requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages via Telegram API, which could expose sensitive Terraform outputs if they contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials -> send_telegram_message constructs API request -> subprocess runs Terraform commands -> outputs retrieved and sent via Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Network activity limited to legitimate API calls. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard deployment automation with notification integration. It uses environment variables for credentials, subprocess for CLI commands, and requests for API calls. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The only operational consideration is that Terraform outputs might contain sensitive data, which should be sanitized before transmission, but this is a deployment best practice, not a flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the potential exposure of sensitive outputs, though no actual vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward deployment automation script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The main operational security consideration is to ensure Terraform outputs do not contain secrets before sharing them via Telegram.",
