  "purpose": "Automates Terraform deployment with Telegram notifications for progress and status updates.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for TELEGRAM_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID; subprocess outputs for terraform commands.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API (potential data exfiltration), subprocess calls to terraform commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used in API calls; subprocess commands execute terraform operations; notifications sent via network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data; no explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard deployment automation tasks, sending progress updates via Telegram. It reads environment variables for API tokens, executes terraform commands via subprocess, and reports status. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data theft, backdoors, or unauthorized network activity are evident. The use of environment variables for tokens is common, though it warrants proper handling. All subprocess commands are standard terraform operations, with retries and status messaging, typical in deployment scripts. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a deployment automation tool with Telegram notifications. It appears legitimate and without malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are observed based on the provided code.",
