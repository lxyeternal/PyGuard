{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python package with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data, processes it, and may perform network operations, but no untrusted sources or suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or data outputs, but no malicious or suspicious activity is observed at these points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or network sinks, with no evidence of malicious manipulation or exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks. No suspicious patterns, malware indicators, or obfuscation techniques were found. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9) where code was available; where no code was provided, confidence is lower (0.4), reflecting limited visibility. Security risk scores are low (0.2), consistent with benign assessment. The scores align with the evidence, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no detected malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessment is consistent and justified based on the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
