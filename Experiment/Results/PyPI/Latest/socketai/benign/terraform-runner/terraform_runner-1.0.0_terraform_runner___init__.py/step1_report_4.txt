  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing, possibly involving network operations or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific input sources are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs, especially if untrusted data is involved. The code may perform system calls or network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and possibly to network or file sinks. Without explicit code, the exact flow is uncertain but likely involves input-to-output pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible. However, if the code includes dynamic execution, obscure variable names, or hidden network requests, these would be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including beginning, middle, and end sections. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or secret communication channels were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code, encrypted payloads, or unusual patterns detected. The structure is typical of benign scripts, but without detailed visibility of all code lines, some uncertainty remains.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and its analysis, there are no clear indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate, with no suspicious behavior observed. Confidence in this conclusion is high, though some minor uncertainties exist due to incomplete code visibility.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
