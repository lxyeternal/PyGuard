{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple grid-world environment and applies Q-Learning and SARSA reinforcement learning algorithms to find optimal policies.",
  "sources": "Reads parameters for environment initialization, random choices for exploration, and environment states during episode execution.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed Q-values and plotted reward graphs; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code reads random values for exploration decisions, updates Q-tables based on environment feedback, and visualizes results; there are no external data flows or untrusted input to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and typical RL algorithms without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a grid environment and two RL algorithms, Q-Learning and SARSA, running multiple episodes and plotting results. It utilizes standard libraries numpy, random, and matplotlib. The code appears straightforward with no suspicious input/output handling, no network communication, and no hidden backdoors. All code functions are typical for RL implementations, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n\nThe only notable aspect is the use of 'random' module for stochastic decisions, which is common in RL exploration strategies. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious side-effects are identified.\n\nOverall, the code is a standard implementation of RL algorithms without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward reinforcement learning implementation without malicious intent or security risks. It serves educational or experimental purposes and does not contain any malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
