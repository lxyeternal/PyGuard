  "purpose": "Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-Learning and SARSA) in a simple 4x4 GridWorld environment for educational or experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment state readings during reset and step functions; random choices for exploration; internal Q-value updates.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output; visualization via matplotlib; print statements for debugging; all data remains local.",
  "flows": "State information flows from environment to algorithms; random exploration decisions; Q-value updates from current state-action to next state-action; visualization outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and typical RL constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of standard RL algorithms applied to a simple grid environment. It employs common Python libraries and typical exploration strategies. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code's purpose appears educational or experimental, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor securityRisk of 0.1 in one report is a conservative estimate but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational implementation of RL algorithms with no malicious features, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly assess its safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
