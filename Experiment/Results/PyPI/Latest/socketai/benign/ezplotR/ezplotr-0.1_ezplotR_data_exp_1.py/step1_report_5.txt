{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple GridWorld environment and applies reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-Learning and SARSA) to learn optimal policies within this environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment state through environment methods (reset, step) and uses random functions for action selection and exploration (random.random(), random.choice()).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or system modification are present; output is limited to printing arrays and plotting graphs.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves environment state updates via step() based on actions, with rewards accumulated and policies updated through Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. Random functions influence decision-making but do not lead to external data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior, are present. The code appears straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and methods for reinforcement learning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a grid environment and two RL algorithms (Q-Learning and SARSA). It uses numpy for Q-table management, random for exploration, and matplotlib for plotting results. No external network activity, data leakage, or system modifications are evident. All functions serve a typical RL purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms in a simple environment. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are detected. It is a legitimate educational or experimental script.",
