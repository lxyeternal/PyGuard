{
  "purpose": "Implement Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms to train an agent in a 4x4 GridWorld environment and compare their performance.",
  "sources": "Reads environment state via env.reset() and env.step(); uses random.random() and random.choice() for stochastic behavior.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or external effects; no untrusted input/output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment states are read from env.reset() and env.step(); actions are chosen via random.choice() or argmax of Q-values; rewards are accumulated per episode.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard numpy and random modules; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or uncommon language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simulates a simple GridWorld environment and applies standard reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-Learning and SARSA). It uses random functions for action selection and environment reset. No external inputs, outputs, or network operations are present. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a straightforward educational or research implementation of RL algorithms with visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard RL training routines without any malicious intent or security risks. It employs typical libraries and functions without suspicious behavior or obfuscation. No supply chain security concerns are evident based on the provided code.",
