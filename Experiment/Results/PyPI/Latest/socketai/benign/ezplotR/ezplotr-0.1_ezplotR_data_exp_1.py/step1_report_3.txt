{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple GridWorld environment and performs reinforcement learning using Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms to learn optimal policies for navigating the grid.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user-defined environment states, random number generation for epsilon-greedy policy, and standard numpy array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks leading to potential data leaks, system modifications, or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment state inputs to Q-value updates; random choices influence action selection; no external data or network interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for reinforcement learning implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical reinforcement learning setup with standard Python libraries numpy, random, and matplotlib. The environment and algorithms are implemented using common patterns without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are evident. The random number usage aligns with common epsilon-greedy exploration strategies. The code appears solely intended for educational or experimental purposes related to RL. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs environment simulation, policy learning, and visualization without any suspicious behaviors.",
