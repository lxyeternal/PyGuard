{
  "purpose": "Implementation of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms within a simple 4x4 GridWorld environment for reinforcement learning experiments and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment state updates during steps and actions, and uses random functions for exploration decisions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; the code outputs are visualizations and printed Q-values, with no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment state and random exploration; flows lead to Q-value updates and plotting, with no external data or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard RL algorithms with clear logic, using common libraries. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The use of randomness is typical, and no external data or network activity occurs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor points such as lack of seed setting for reproducibility do not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
