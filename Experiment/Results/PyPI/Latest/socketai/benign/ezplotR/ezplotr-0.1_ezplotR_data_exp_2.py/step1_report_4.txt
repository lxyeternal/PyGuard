{
  "purpose": "The code implements Q-Learning and SARSA reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent on a simple 4x4 GridWorld environment, visualizing the reward progression over episodes.",
  "sources": "The code reads random seedless input from the 'random' module and generates random actions for exploration; it also uses environment state data within the 'GridWorld' class.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data externally, access sensitive data, or perform any network operations; it only processes and visualizes internal simulation data.",
  "flows": "Random decisions (source) influence action selection, which affects environment states and rewards (sink). The flow is primarily within the RL training loop, with no external data leak or malicious output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward with standard RL implementation; no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simple GridWorld environment and applies standard Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms, updating Q-values based on the environment feedback. It uses the 'random' module for exploration decisions. No external network calls, file access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The plotting of results is for visualization purposes only. The code structure is conventional and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard reinforcement learning implementation for a GridWorld environment without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
