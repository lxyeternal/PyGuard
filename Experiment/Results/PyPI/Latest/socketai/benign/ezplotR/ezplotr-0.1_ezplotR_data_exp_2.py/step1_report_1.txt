{
  "purpose": "The code implements Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms to train an agent in a 4x4 GridWorld environment, with visualization of training rewards.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment state via reset() and step() functions, and uses random functions for exploration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that lead to data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from environment interaction (reset and step functions) through the Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms, updating Q-values and accumulating rewards. No untrusted data sources or network communication are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard reinforcement learning implementations.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a standard implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms in a simulated environment. It uses common libraries (numpy, matplotlib, random) without any suspicious or malicious code. The code involves no external network communication, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. All functions and classes serve a clear purpose related to training an agent in a grid environment. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure and logic are typical for such algorithms, and there are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for a simple grid environment. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or malicious obfuscation. It is a standard educational or experimental reinforcement learning script.",
