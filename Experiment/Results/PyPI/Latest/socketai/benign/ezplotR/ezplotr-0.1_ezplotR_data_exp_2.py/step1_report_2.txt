{
  "purpose": "Implement Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for a simple GridWorld environment to compare their performance.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment state variables, random number generator for action selection, and NumPy arrays for Q-values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear data leaks, network operations, or write operations to external systems.",
  "flows": "Inputs (environment states, random choices) influence Q-value updates and episode rewards; no untrusted external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code uses standard libraries and typical RL implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple GridWorld environment and implements standard Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms with common parameters. It uses random functions for exploration and NumPy for Q-table management. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not interact with external systems beyond plotting results locally. There are no suspicious data flows or unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms for educational purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It solely uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
