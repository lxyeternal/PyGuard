{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for reading and writing experiment files and multiple subclasses representing different plots, each associated with specific experiment files.",
  "sources": "Reading files from a 'data' directory based on constructed filenames.",
  "sinks": "Writing content to specified output files via save_content method.",
  "flows": "Construction of file paths from class attributes leading to file read/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code straightforwardly reads and writes files.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs file paths based on class attributes and reads content from files within a 'data' directory. The save_content method writes to user-specified output files. There are no untrusted data sources like user input or network data, nor do there appear to be any malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The code structure is standard and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple file management utility for experimental data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended without suspicious activities.",
