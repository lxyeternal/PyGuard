  "purpose": "Manage reading, printing, and saving experiment files stored in a 'data' directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sources": "File paths constructed based on class attributes, reading files with open()",
  "sinks": "Writing content to specified output files",
  "flows": "Class instantiation -> file path construction -> file reading/writing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; minimal validation on filenames",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing experiment files, using standard Python modules and practices. It constructs file paths based on class attributes, reads from files if they exist, and writes content to specified files. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code does not process untrusted user input directly, and the logic is simple and clear. Minor concerns include lack of input validation and exception handling, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe for its purpose. No malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
