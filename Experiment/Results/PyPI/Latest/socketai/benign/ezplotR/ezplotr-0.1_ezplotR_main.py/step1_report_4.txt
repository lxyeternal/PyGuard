{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for reading and writing experiment files and several subclasses that instantiate specific experiment files based on an index.",
  "sources": "The code reads file paths constructed from the current file location and a filename pattern, then reads content from those files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes content to user-specified output files.",
  "flows": "File path is constructed from the script's directory and filename, then content is read from or written to these files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file path construction, file reading, and writing operations. It uses safe methods like os.path.join and checks for file existence before reading. No user input is directly processed, nor are there external network calls, code injections, or data leaks. The design appears to be for experiment management with standard I/O operations. No indicators of malicious intent or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for managing experiment scripts and their content. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
