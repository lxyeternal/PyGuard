{
  "purpose": "To load and manage experiment scripts from files located in a specific data directory.",
  "sources": "File system reads in _read_file() and _get_file_path() methods, specifically reading from files in a data directory based on the class instance index.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, execution of untrusted code, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "File path generation from class attributes -> reading file content -> optional writing content to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs standard file I/O based on class attributes and user input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for experiments that reads content from a file based on a constructed file path. It uses standard os.path methods for path handling and basic file operations. Multiple subclasses instantiate the base class with different indices, which determine the filename. No user input is processed directly, and there are no network or code execution features. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or credential handling. The code appears to be standard for managing experiment scripts stored as files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward file management utility for loading and saving experiment scripts. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation for file handling.",
