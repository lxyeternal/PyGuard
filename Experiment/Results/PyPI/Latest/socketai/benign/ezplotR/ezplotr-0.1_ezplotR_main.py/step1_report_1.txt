{
  "purpose": "Defines classes to read, print, and save experiment files based on an index, with subclasses for different plot experiments.",
  "sources": "The method _read_file() reads data from a file located in a data directory relative to the script location.",
  "sinks": "The save_content() method writes data to an output file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "The file path is constructed from input parameters and the script's location, then data flows from filesystem to class attributes, and from class attributes to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. No suspicious dynamic execution, external network activity, or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages file I/O operations, reading files from a specific directory and writing content to user-specified files. It uses standard Python functions os.path and open() with no apparent input validation or sanitization, but no malicious intent is evident. The class hierarchy appears straightforward, designed for experiment management. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file handling for experiment data management without any malicious or suspicious activity. It appears safe and straightforward.",
