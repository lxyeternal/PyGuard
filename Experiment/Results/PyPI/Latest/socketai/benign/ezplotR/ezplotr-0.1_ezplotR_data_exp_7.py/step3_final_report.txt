  "purpose": "Implementation of value iteration algorithm for a grid-world Markov Decision Process (MDP).",
  "sources": "Internal parameters such as grid size, actions, reward, and the V array; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Console output of the value function and policy; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "From internal parameters and numpy array V to the computation of updated values and policy derivation; no external data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, uses standard reinforcement learning techniques, with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard value iteration for a grid-world environment, updating the value function until convergence, then deriving an optimal policy. It uses fixed parameters, no external inputs, and outputs only to the console. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The implementation is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical RL algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is an overestimation given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of value iteration for a grid-world MDP. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its benign and transparent nature.",
