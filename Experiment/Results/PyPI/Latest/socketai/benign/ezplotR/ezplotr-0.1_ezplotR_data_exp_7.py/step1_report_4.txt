{
  "purpose": "The code implements a value iteration algorithm for a grid-based Markov Decision Process to determine the optimal policy and value function.",
  "sources": "Reads static parameters (grid size, actions, reward, action effects, and value array V). Reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the computed value function V and policy matrix. No untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Calculates state values based on current policy, updating the V array, then derives the policy from the updated V. No data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard value iteration process with clear logic. It iterates until convergence, then derives an optimal policy. All code appears consistent with common reinforcement learning implementations. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured and straightforward, with no suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of value iteration for grid-world planning. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity and poses no security risks.",
