{
  "purpose": "This code implements a value iteration algorithm for a grid-world Markov Decision Process to determine the optimal policy and value function.",
  "sources": "Reads grid dimensions, actions, reward values, and the V array storing value estimates.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; only outputs the computed value function and policy.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (grid size, actions, rewards) influence the value iteration loop, updating the V array, which then informs policy derivation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious input handling, or unusual code patterns; no backdoors or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward implementation of a known algorithm.",
  "analysis": "The code performs value iteration for grid-world reinforcement learning, updating value estimates until convergence. It uses numpy for array operations and prints the final value function and policy. No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is standard for this type of algorithm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of value iteration for grid-world problems, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for educational or simulation purposes.",
