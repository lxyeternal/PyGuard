{
  "purpose": "The code implements a value iteration algorithm for a grid-world environment to determine the optimal value function and policy.",
  "sources": "The code reads fixed parameters such as grid size, actions, gamma, theta, and reward. It also reads from the numpy array V for state values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data over the network, write to external files, or access environment variables. It primarily outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "The algorithm updates the value function V based on current values, then derives a policy based on the computed V, completing the source-to-sink flow within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard numpy functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard value iteration process for a grid-world environment, with proper handling of terminal states and boundary conditions. It computes the value function and derives the optimal policy accordingly. There are no signs of malicious code or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and focused on reinforcement learning computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of value iteration for a grid-world problem. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply performs mathematical calculations and prints the results.",
