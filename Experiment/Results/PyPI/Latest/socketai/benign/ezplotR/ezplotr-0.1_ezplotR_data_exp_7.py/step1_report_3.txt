{
  "purpose": "This code implements a value iteration algorithm for a grid-based Markov Decision Process to compute the optimal value function and policy.",
  "sources": "Input source is the hardcoded grid size, action definitions, reward, and terminal state. No external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output is the printed value function and policy; no data leaks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads grid parameters and initializes the value matrix. It updates the value function through iterative calculations based on the grid and actions. Final computed values are displayed via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard numpy operations and control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard value iteration algorithm for a grid-world problem, iterating until convergence based on a threshold. It carefully handles boundary conditions and updates policy accordingly. No external inputs, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a reinforcement learning technique without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a grid-world value iteration algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
