  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign, with high suspicion only in Report 4 due to obfuscation and network activity. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores for Report 3 is recommended to account for obfuscation concerns. Overall, the scoring system aligns well with the evidence, ensuring accurate representation of risk levels."
