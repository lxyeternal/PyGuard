  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code initialization, network activity, dynamic execution, hardcoded addresses, input data, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like network transmission or file modification, potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic evaluation, network activity, hardcoded addresses, minimal or suspicious structure, inconsistent or excessive obfuscation scores.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion. Most samples are benign with straightforward logic, no obfuscation, and no malicious indicators, reflected in low malware and security risk scores. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.8) scores. Slightly increasing the malware and obfuscation scores for Report 3 from 0 to 0.2 and 0.5 respectively aligns with the presence of obfuscation but no malicious activity. Overall, the scores are consistent with the descriptions and evidence, with the exception of a minor adjustment for Report 3 to better reflect potential concealment without confirmed malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign, with high suspicion only in Report 4 due to obfuscation and network activity. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores for Report 3 is recommended to account for obfuscation concerns. Overall, the scoring system aligns well with the evidence, ensuring accurate representation of risk levels.",
