  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without seeing specific details, it's unclear if it is benign or malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; specific data sources are not provided in the visible snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points, but no explicit malicious actions are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through functions or processing steps; specifics are not detailed in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected. However, due to the lack of detailed code, some subtle issues cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks clear signs of malicious intent such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoor behavior. It appears to be straightforward, but without concrete code lines, the analysis is limited. No insecure patterns or unusual code constructs are evident in the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no evident signs of malware or significant security risks. The code seems benign, but the lack of detailed content limits a thorough assessment.",
