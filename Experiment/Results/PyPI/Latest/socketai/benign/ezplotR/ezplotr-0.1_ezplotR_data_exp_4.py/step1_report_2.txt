{
  "purpose": "Simulation of multi-armed bandit algorithms to compare sample-average and constant step-size methods in a stochastic environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from numpy, matplotlib, and standard random functions; uses np.random.randn(), np.random.choice(), np.random.rand(), np.random.normal()",
  "sinks": "Generates plots saved as 'plot.png' with matplotlib; no other data sinks or external communications observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from random number generation to reward calculation, to statistical updating, and finally to plotting",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; uses standard libraries and functions in a typical manner",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard simulation of multi-armed bandit algorithms with reward updates and plotting. It uses np.random for stochastic behavior, updating estimated values based on reward feedback, and plots results. No indications of malicious data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. It performs typical calculations and visualization without suspicious or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward simulation of bandit algorithms for research or educational purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It only reads from well-known libraries, processes data internally, and outputs a plot image file.",
