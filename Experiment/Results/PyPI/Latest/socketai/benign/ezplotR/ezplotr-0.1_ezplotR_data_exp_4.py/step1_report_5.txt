{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simulation of the multi-armed bandit problem to compare different action-value estimation methods (sample average vs. constant step-size). It generates plots of average rewards and optimal action percentages over multiple runs.",
  "sources": "Reads include numpy's random functions, array initializations, and user-specified parameters. Data inputs are internal random number generations; no external data sources or user inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are generated plots saved as 'plot.png' and displayed via plt.show(). No data is sent over the network, stored externally, or leaked.",
  "flows": "The code flows from simulation data generation through internal calculations to plotting and saving visualizations, with no external data flow or command execution outside the script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code uses standard numpy and matplotlib libraries and typical simulation logic.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes parameters and performs multiple runs of a bandit experiment, updating estimated action values and true action values with Gaussian noise. It then aggregates results, plots them, and saves the plots. No external data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are detected. All operations are standard for such simulations and visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward simulation of a multi-armed bandit problem for analytical or educational purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage present.",
