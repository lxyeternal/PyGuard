  "purpose": "Standard multi-armed bandit simulation using epsilon-greedy strategies with numpy and matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Input data from np.random.rand(), np.random.randn(), and np.random.normal(); data read during reward generation and true value updates.",
  "sinks": "Plotting results with plt.savefig() and plt.show(); no external data transmission or storage beyond local file.",
  "flows": "Random number generation influences action selection and reward; reward updates influence estimated values; true value updates influence subsequent action choices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard reinforcement learning experiment for multi-armed bandits, with clear logic, appropriate use of libraries, and no hidden or malicious features. Data flows are internal, and no external network activity or data exfiltration occurs. The true action values are updated with Gaussian noise, which is typical for non-stationary environments. The scoring assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) aligns with the benign and transparent nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, transparent, and performs a typical RL simulation without malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
