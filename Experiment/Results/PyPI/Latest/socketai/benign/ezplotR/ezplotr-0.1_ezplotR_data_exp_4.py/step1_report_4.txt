  "purpose": "The code simulates a multi-armed bandit problem to compare different action-value estimation methods (sample average vs. constant step size) and visualizes the results.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand(), np.random.randn(), np.random.normal() for generating randomness and stochastic rewards.",
  "sinks": "np.random functions used to generate rewards and noise; plt.savefig() and plt.show() for visualization.",
  "flows": "Random number generators produce reward signals and noise, which influence the estimated action values and reward metrics. The data flows into plots and the saved image file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials present. The code uses standard libraries and methods for simulation and visualization without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard simulation of epsilon-greedy bandit algorithms with both sample-average and constant step-size updates. The randomness sources are typical for stochastic reward modeling. The data flow from reward generation to plotting is straightforward and aligns with common practices in reinforcement learning experiments. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not interact with external systems, network, or data leaks. It solely conducts simulation and visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign simulation for research or educational purposes regarding multi-armed bandit algorithms. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are identified.",
