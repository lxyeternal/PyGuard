  "sources": "np.random.rand(), np.random.randn(), np.random.choice(), np.argmax()",
  "sinks": "np.random.rand(), np.random.randn(), np.random.choice(), np.argmax()",
  "flows": "Random functions generate rewards and select actions, influencing reward and action count updates",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears standard for reinforcement learning experiments with no hidden or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code runs a multi-armed bandit simulation with two strategies: sample-average and constant step-size. It updates true action values with noise each step, chooses actions based on epsilon-greedy policy, and calculates rewards accordingly. The results are averaged over multiple runs and plotted. All functions and data flows are consistent with typical reinforcement learning experiments. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections are present. External libraries are used appropriately without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard multi-armed bandit simulation script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for experimental purposes in reinforcement learning.",
