{
  "purpose": "Simulate and compare different action-value estimation methods in a multi-armed bandit problem, visualizing average rewards and optimal action percentages.",
  "sources": "Reads random numbers for reward generation and action selection; reads numpy arrays for calculations; reads matplotlib functions for plotting.",
  "sinks": "Uses plt.savefig to write plot image to 'plot.png'; no other sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Random number generation influences reward and action choice; results stored in arrays; visualization generated and saved as an image file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data handling observed. The code uses standard scientific libraries and methods for simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical simulation of a multi-armed bandit problem using epsilon-greedy strategies. It utilizes numpy for numeric calculations, including reward noise and true action values. The results are accumulated over multiple runs and then visualized using matplotlib, with the output saved as a PNG image. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors were detected. The only file output is a plot image, which is typical for such simulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate simulation script for reinforcement learning experiments without any malicious intent or security risks. It solely generates visualizations of algorithm performance metrics.",
