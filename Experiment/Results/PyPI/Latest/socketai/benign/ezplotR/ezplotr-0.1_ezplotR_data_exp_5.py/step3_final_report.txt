  "purpose": "Implementation and comparison of UCB and optimistic initialization algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems, used for research or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "numpy for random reward generation, standard Python functions, and matplotlib for plotting results.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O beyond plotting, or network activity; data remains local.",
  "flows": "Random rewards generated from numpy normal distributions feed into the update functions for each algorithm; results are plotted locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard multi-armed bandit algorithms with typical random reward generation and visualization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, uses well-known libraries, and performs internal simulations without external data leaks or network activity. The security and malware scores are consistent with its benign, research-oriented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of multi-armed bandit algorithms for experimental purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
