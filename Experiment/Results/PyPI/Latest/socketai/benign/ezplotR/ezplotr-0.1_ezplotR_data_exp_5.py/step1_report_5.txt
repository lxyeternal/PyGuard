  "purpose": "The code implements and compares two multi-armed bandit algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization) for reinforcement learning simulations, with plotting of results.",
  "sources": "Input sources include random number generation for rewards and true action values, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Output plots displaying the average reward over steps; no data leaks or external outputs that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Random data generation (sources) feeds into the bandit algorithms (sinks) through reward functions, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs are present. Usage of numpy and matplotlib are standard scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for multi-armed bandit simulation, implements two standard algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization), and plots the comparative performance. Random number generation is used for reward simulation, which is normal for such experiments. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling. All functions serve a clear purpose related to the simulation. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and relies solely on standard scientific libraries. No indicators of supply chain attack or malware are observed.",
