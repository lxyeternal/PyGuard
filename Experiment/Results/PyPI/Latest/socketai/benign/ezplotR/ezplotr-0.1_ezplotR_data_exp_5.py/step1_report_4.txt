{
  "purpose": "The code implements and compares two algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization) for the multi-armed bandit problem, with visualization of their performance.",
  "sources": "np.random.normal for reward generation, np.random.normal for true action values, and np.random.rand for random initialization of bandit parameters.",
  "sinks": "np.argmax to select actions, plt.show() to display the plot, and reward updates to store results.",
  "flows": "Randomly generated true action values (sources) influence reward sampling (sinks). Action selection based on estimates flows from the algorithms, and rewards are accumulated and plotted for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. Use of standard libraries (numpy, matplotlib) appears benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution that suggests malicious intent. The code structure and flow are straightforward and typical for experimental implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for the k-armed bandit environment, with methods for reward generation and resetting parameters. Two algorithms, UCB and optimistic initialization, are implemented with standard logic for exploration-exploitation strategies. The experiments generate rewards over multiple steps and plot the cumulative average rewards for comparison. All operations involve standard scientific computing libraries and typical reinforcement learning algorithms. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a benign implementation for research or educational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of bandit algorithms with data visualization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended for experimental or illustrative use.",
