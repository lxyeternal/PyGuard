  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of multi-armed bandit algorithms for experimental purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
