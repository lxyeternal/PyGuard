{
  "purpose": "Implement and compare two algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization) for the k-armed bandit problem, visualize their performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user-defined parameters; generates random rewards using numpy's normal distribution functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; data is used internally for calculations and plotting, no data transmission or external storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy random functions to reward calculations, then to plotting; no untrusted external data sources or outputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code appears to follow standard experimental procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a k-armed bandit environment, implements two standard algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization), runs simulations, and plots the results. Random number generation is used for reward sampling, which is typical in such algorithms. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. Usage of numpy and matplotlib is standard for scientific computation and visualization. No hardcoded credentials or obscure code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of bandit algorithms for experimental comparison, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not exhibit malware behavior.",
