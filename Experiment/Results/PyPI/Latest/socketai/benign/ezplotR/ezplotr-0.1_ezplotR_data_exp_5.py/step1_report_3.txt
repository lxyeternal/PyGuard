{
  "purpose": "The code implements and compares two multi-armed bandit algorithms (UCB and optimistic initialization) to evaluate their performance in an environment with stochastic rewards.",
  "sources": "Data is read from np.random.normal calls for true action values and reward simulation, and from array operations during algorithm execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted or external data, nor any operations that send data over a network or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data from np.random.normal (sources) influences reward calculations; estimated values and counts are updated based on these rewards; results are plotted locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no hidden or malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code models a standard reinforcement learning experiment with two strategies for action selection. It uses numpy for random number generation and array operations, and matplotlib for visualization. All data flows appear to be within the scope of typical simulation code, with no external or untrusted inputs involved. No indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network communications are present. The randomness is controlled internally with numpy's normal distribution, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques are used.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of bandit algorithms for simulation and visualization purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign research or educational script.",
