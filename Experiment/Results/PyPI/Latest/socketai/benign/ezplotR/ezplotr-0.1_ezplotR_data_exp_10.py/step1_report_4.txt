{
  "purpose": "The code performs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π and visualizes the results, including convergence analysis.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform, np.random.seed, input data for simulation (random coordinates)",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions for visualization, print statements for output",
  "flows": "Random data generated via np.random.uniform (source) flows into calculations of inside_circle, then to visualization and output functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no unusual or misleading code structures",
  "analysis": "The code uses numpy for generating uniform random samples and matplotlib for visualization. It performs standard Monte Carlo simulation steps to estimate π, including setting a fixed seed for reproducibility. It visualizes points inside and outside a quarter circle and plots the convergence of estimates with increasing sample sizes. No external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, nor any code that appears malicious. All components and functions serve legitimate computational and visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Monte Carlo simulation for estimating π, with visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and safe to use.",
