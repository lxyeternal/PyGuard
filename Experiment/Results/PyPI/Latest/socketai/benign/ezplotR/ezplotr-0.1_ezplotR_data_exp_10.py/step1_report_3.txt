{
  "purpose": "Perform Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π and visualize the convergence and sampling distribution.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform for generating random points, np.random.seed for reproducibility, print statements for output, matplotlib for visualization.",
  "sinks": "None that directly involve untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; outputs are printed and plotted locally.",
  "flows": "Random data generated in 'estimate_pi' function flows into calculations determining inside/outside circle, then into visualization; seed ensures reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Code performs standard statistical simulation and visualization without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Monte Carlo estimation of π using numpy's random number generation, seeded for reproducibility. It visualizes points and convergence behavior via matplotlib. No external data sources or sinks are involved that could leak information. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All functions and data flows are typical for a scientific computation script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard scientific visualization tool for Monte Carlo estimation of π. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It uses common libraries and functions appropriately, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
