  "purpose": "Perform a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π, visualize the points inside and outside the quarter circle, and analyze convergence behavior.",
  "sources": "Random number generation via numpy.random.uniform for x and y coordinates, fixed seed for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; visualization outputs (scatter plots and convergence plot).",
  "flows": "Generation of random points (source) to inside/outside check, then visualization; convergence analysis repeatedly calls estimate_pi with different sample sizes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard scientific Monte Carlo simulation with visualization and convergence analysis. It uses numpy for random number generation with a fixed seed, checks points inside a quarter circle, and plots results. No malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is correct, and the code adheres to best practices. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code is benign and intended for educational or analytical purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of π estimation via Monte Carlo methods, with visualization and convergence analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the safe and transparent nature of the code.",
