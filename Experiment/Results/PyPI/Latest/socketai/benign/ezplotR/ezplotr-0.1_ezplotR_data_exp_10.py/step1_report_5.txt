{
  "purpose": "The code performs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π using random point generation within a square and checks points inside a quarter circle.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform for generating random x and y coordinates, np.random.seed for reproducibility",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external output handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Random data generated by np.random.uniform is used to calculate π estimate; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations or external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for Monte Carlo simulation using numpy for random number generation, matplotlib for visualization, and straightforward calculations to estimate π. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration, is present. The seed is set for reproducibility, which is common in simulations. All operations are standard mathematical and plotting procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate mathematical simulation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply estimates π via Monte Carlo methods and visualizes the results using standard libraries.",
