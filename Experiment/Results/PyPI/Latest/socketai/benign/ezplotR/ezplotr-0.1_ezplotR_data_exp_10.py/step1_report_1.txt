  "purpose": "To perform a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the value of π and visualize the convergence of the estimate.",
  "sources": "np.random.uniform for generating random points, input parameters like num_samples, and seed setting for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "Output print statements displaying the estimated value of π, actual π, and the absolute error; plotting functions that visualize the data and convergence.",
  "flows": "Random number generation (source) flows into the estimate_pi function, which computes whether points are inside the circle (filtering data). Results then flow into print statements and plotting functions for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard numerical libraries (numpy, matplotlib) to perform a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating π. Random points are generated uniformly in the unit square, and points inside the quarter circle are counted. The estimate is visualized through scatter plots, and convergence is analyzed across increasing sample sizes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The seed setting ensures reproducibility and is standard practice. The overall structure and functions are typical for such simulations, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Monte Carlo method to estimate π with visualization, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
