{
  "purpose": "The code performs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π, visualizes the points inside and outside a quarter circle, and analyzes the convergence of the estimation as the sample size increases.",
  "sources": "Reads the number of samples from the variable 'num_samples' and 'sample_sizes'. Uses numpy's random.uniform function to generate random coordinates. Uses print statements to output results.",
  "sinks": "Outputs estimated π and errors via print statements. Generates plots displaying the distribution of points and convergence trends.",
  "flows": "Random data from numpy.random.uniform flows into inside_circle calculation and estimation. Estimated results are printed and visualized through plots.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The use of numpy's random functions with a fixed seed is standard for reproducibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Monte Carlo techniques with numpy for generating random points and matplotlib for visualization. The seed setting ensures reproducibility. No external data, network access, or suspicious file handling is involved. No obfuscated code features or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward scientific calculation and visualization script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of Monte Carlo simulation for π estimation with visualization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code serves an educational or analytical purpose.",
