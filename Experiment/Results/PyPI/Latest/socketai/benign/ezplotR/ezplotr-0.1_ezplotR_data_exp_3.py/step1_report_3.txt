  "purpose": "Simulate and visualize the epsilon-greedy algorithm's performance on multi-armed bandit problems, analyzing average rewards and optimal action percentages over steps.",
  "sources": "numpy.random.normal for generating true means and rewards, random.random for epsilon-greedy exploration decisions, np.random.randint for arm selection, numpy functions for data manipulation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code outputs plots and prints to the console. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data sources (random number generators) influence the reward simulation and exploration decisions. The code calculates and plots metrics based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors are detected. Usage of random number generators and plotting functions are standard for simulation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simulation of the epsilon-greedy algorithm for multi-armed bandits, generating random true means and rewards using numpy's normal distribution. It tracks rewards and optimal arm pulls over multiple steps, updating estimates iteratively. The exploration decision is based on the random module. Data is only used internally for plotting and console output. No external data, network connections, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to be a standard simulation script for reinforcement learning algorithms, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward simulation of an epsilon-greedy bandit problem, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in educational or research contexts.",
