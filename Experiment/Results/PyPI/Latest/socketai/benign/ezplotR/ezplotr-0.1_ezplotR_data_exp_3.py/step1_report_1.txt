  "purpose": "Simulate and plot the performance of the epsilon-greedy algorithm on a multi-armed bandit problem with varying epsilon values.",
  "sources": "np.random.normal for generating true means and rewards, random.random() for epsilon-greedy decision, np.random.randint for arm selection.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data output to external systems; plots are generated locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source random number generation to reward calculations, updates, and plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and typical algorithms for simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard epsilon-greedy simulation with no suspicious code or malicious behavior. It generates random data, updates estimates, and plots results. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external communications are present. No obfuscated code features or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign simulation of epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit performance analysis. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
