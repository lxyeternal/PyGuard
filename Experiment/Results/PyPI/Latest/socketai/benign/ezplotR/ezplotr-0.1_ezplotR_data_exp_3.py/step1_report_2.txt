{
  "purpose": "Simulate and plot the performance of epsilon-greedy algorithms on multi-armed bandit problems to analyze reward and optimal action percentages over steps.",
  "sources": "Random number generation for true means (np.random.normal), initial estimates (np.random.normal), reward sampling (np.random.normal), and random exploration decisions (random.random, np.random.randint).",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks that lead to data leaks, external communications, or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Random number generators produce data used internally; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Randomization functions are used as intended for simulation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code simulates a standard epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit problem, generating true arm means and rewards, updating estimates, and plotting results. All functions used are standard scientific libraries and random functions appropriate for simulation. No suspicious or malicious code or backdoors are present. No external data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign simulation of reinforcement learning strategies with visualization. No malicious or suspicious activities are present. It is a standard, well-structured implementation for educational or research purposes.",
