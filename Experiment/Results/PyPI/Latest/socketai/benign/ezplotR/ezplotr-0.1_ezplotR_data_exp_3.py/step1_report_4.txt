  "purpose": "Simulate and analyze epsilon-greedy strategies for multi-armed bandit problems, generating plots of average reward and percentage of optimal actions over steps.",
  "sources": "Random seed source for np.random.normal and np.random.randint; random.random() for epsilon exploration decision",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, external network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data from numpy random functions and random.random() influences decision-making; results stored in variables for plotting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; the code appears to implement a standard simulation with proper data flow",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward simulation of epsilon-greedy bandit algorithms using numpy and random libraries. It generates true arm means, initializes reward estimates, and iterates over steps to update estimates based on rewards. The use of numpy functions and random module is appropriate for the simulation. The plotting commands are standard and do not contain malicious code or obfuscation. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code’s structure and functions are typical for such a simulation, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign simulation of epsilon-greedy bandit strategies. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code appears legitimate and focused solely on analysis and visualization of the bandit algorithm performance.",
