  "purpose": "Simulation of epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit algorithms across multiple bandits and arms, generating reward estimates and plotting performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Random generation of true arm means (np.random.normal), initial reward sampling (np.random.normal), random exploration decisions (random.random, np.random.randint).",
  "sinks": "No external data, network communication, or data exfiltration points; all data remains within the simulation environment.",
  "flows": "Source of true means -> reward sampling from normal distribution -> updating estimates -> decision-making via epsilon-greedy policy -> plotting results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Initialization of 'Qi' is unconventional but benign and unused in critical logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit simulation using numpy and matplotlib. It generates true arm means, initializes reward estimates, and iteratively updates them based on sampled rewards. Exploration occurs randomly, and results are plotted for analysis. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The random functions are used appropriately for stochastic simulation. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The initial 'Qi' array is generated but not used in the main logic, which is benign. Overall, the code is a typical research/educational simulation with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit simulation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
