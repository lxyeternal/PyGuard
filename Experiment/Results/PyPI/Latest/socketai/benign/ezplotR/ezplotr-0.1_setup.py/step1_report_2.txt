{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'ezplotR' Python package, specifying package data and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, package data files, and dependencies from the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes package data during installation, but no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static setup configuration, no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'package_data' references 'data/*.py', which is unusual as data directories often contain non-Python files; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, package discovery, data inclusion, and dependencies. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns are observed. The reference to 'data/*.py' is slightly atypical but not inherently malicious. No external network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
