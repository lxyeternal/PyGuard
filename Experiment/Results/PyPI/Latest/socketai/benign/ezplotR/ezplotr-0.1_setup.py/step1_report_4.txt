{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'ezplotR' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup configuration does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The package_data field specifies inclusion of Python files in a data directory, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package metadata and data inclusion. No external input handling, no execution of dynamic code, and no network operations are present. The package_data field's inclusion of '*.py' files under 'data/' is slightly atypical, as data directories usually contain non-code data, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
