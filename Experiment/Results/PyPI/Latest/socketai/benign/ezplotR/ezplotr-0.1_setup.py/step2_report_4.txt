  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- The only unusual aspect is the inclusion of `'data/*.py'` as package data, which is atypical since `.py` files are source code, not static data.\n- No external input, network activity, code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present in the code that would indicate malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The inclusion of `.py` files as package data is unconventional but not harmful.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the inclusion of Python source files as package data, which is not standard but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n\n1. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No reason to increase these scores.\n\n2. **Security Risk:**\n   - No external input, code execution, or network activity.\n   - The inclusion of `*.py` files as data is unusual but not harmful.\n   - Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n3. **Potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made about unverified behaviors; the analysis correctly notes the lack of dynamic or malicious code.\n\n4. **Scores consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the described code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The inclusion of Python files as package data might be a misconfiguration or oversight but does not constitute a security concern.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**               |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**               |\n| Security Risk   | **0**               |\n\nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary based on the provided information.",
