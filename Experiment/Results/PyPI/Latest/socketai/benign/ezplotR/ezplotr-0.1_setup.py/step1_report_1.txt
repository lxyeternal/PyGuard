  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for the 'ezplotR' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines package metadata and includes package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The inclusion of 'data/*.py' as package data is unusual since '.py' files are typically source code and not static data; this could be a misconfiguration but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup parameters, including package name, version, package discovery, and data inclusion. The 'package_data' includes Python files in the 'data' directory, which is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No external input or environment variables are read; no code execution or network activity is present. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup without any malicious intent. The inclusion of Python files as data is unusual but not harmful. Overall, there is no indication of malware or security risks.",
