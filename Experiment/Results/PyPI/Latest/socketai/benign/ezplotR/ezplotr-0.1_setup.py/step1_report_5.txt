{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'ezplotR' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data files from 'data/*.py' within the 'ezplotR' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup process is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules and calls setup() with package details. It specifies the package name, version, packages to include, package data files, and dependencies. The package data points to 'data/*.py' inside 'ezplotR', which is unusual because package data typically includes non-code assets, but this alone isn't malicious. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external interactions. The script appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Based on this, the malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
