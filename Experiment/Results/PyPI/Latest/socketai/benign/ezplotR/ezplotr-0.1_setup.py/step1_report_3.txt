{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ezplotR', specifying package data and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, 'find_packages()' to locate packages, and the 'package_data' specification.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities. No dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters define package metadata and data inclusion, with no dynamic data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The package data path 'data/*.py' is consistent with package data inclusion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, packages, package data, and dependencies. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The 'package_data' includes Python files in a 'data' directory, which appears normal. No dynamic or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
