{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and include package data for the 'ezplotR' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only uses static package metadata and package discovery functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of Python source files ('data/*.py') as package data, which is atypical but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. The inclusion of '.py' files as package data is unconventional but does not pose security risks. Multiple expert reviews concur that there is no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with an unusual but harmless inclusion of Python files as package data. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security posture is very high, and no changes are necessary.",
