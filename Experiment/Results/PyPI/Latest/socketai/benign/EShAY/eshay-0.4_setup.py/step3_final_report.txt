{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'EShAY', with metadata related to genetics data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the script only defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static metadata definitions into the setup() function, with no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The author_email contains a comma: '<g.oreilly@garvan.org,au>', which is invalid email syntax but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no additional insights. The only technical issue is the malformed email address, which should be corrected. Given the absence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal. The minor email formatting issue does not constitute a security concern but should be fixed for proper metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only correction needed is fixing the email address format. Scores are set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score due to the email typo.",
