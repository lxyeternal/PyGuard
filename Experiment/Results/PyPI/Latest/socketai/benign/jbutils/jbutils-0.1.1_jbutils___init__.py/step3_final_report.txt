  "purpose": "Re-exporting constants and utility functions from jbutils modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from jbutils.consts and jbutils.utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; the code only imports and re-exports functions and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is static and purely re-exporting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific constants and functions from internal jbutils modules and re-exports them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard for a Python API module, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or embedded secrets. The reports provided are empty, containing no details or claims, which prevents any suspicion or risk assessment based on report content. Given the benign nature of the code and lack of report evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign re-export module with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The empty reports do not indicate any vulnerabilities or malicious activity. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting a safe and straightforward implementation.",
