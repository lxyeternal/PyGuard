  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward Python module that re-exports constants and utility functions from other modules within `jbutils`.\n   - There are no embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.\n   - The code simply imports and exposes certain constants and functions, which is typical for an API module.\n\n2. **Reported Issues**:\n   - All reports are empty responses with \"Empty response\" as the error.\n   - There are no details, explanations, or claims about vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - Since the reports contain no information, there are no claims to evaluate or challenge.\n   - The absence of details prevents any meaningful assessment of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Score Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Given the code is a simple re-export of functions and constants, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: The code is clear and straightforward; it is not obfuscated. The obfuscated score should be zero.\n   - **Risk Score**: Without any claims or evidence of issues, the risk score should be minimal, likely close to zero.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims are made in the reports, so there's nothing to challenge or validate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - Since the reports are empty and contain no allegations, the scores should reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, and the lack of detailed reports means there are no grounds for concern.**",
