  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward module that re-exports constants and utility functions from other parts of the `jbutils` package.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n   - The code is well-structured, with clear `__all__` exports, which is good practice.\n\n2. **Reported Issues:**\n   - All reports are empty responses with no details provided.\n   - Without specific details, errors, or suspicious behavior described, there's no basis to identify vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Since no issues are described, any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores should logically be zero.\n   - The lack of details prevents any meaningful assessment of potential security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - There are no claims or assumptions to challenge here, given the absence of report content.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores should reflect the absence of reported issues.\n   - Given the empty reports, assigning a high malware or risk score would be unjustified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no reported issues or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are empty, indicating no detected issues. Based on the provided code and reports, there is no reason to suspect any security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I recommend maintaining the current scores at zero.\n- If future reports contain details, reassessment should be performed accordingly.",
