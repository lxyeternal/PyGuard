  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that exports constants and utility functions from the `jbutils` package.\n   - There are no embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The functions and constants are imported and then re-exported via `__all__`, which is standard practice.\n   - No code execution, dynamic code, or external network activity is present.\n   \n   **Conclusion**: The code itself appears benign and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Report Content**:\n   - All reports are empty responses with \"Empty response\" errors.\n   - No details, analysis, or claims are provided about vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n   \n   **Conclusion**: There is no information to evaluate regarding potential security issues.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no issues are reported or evidenced, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there is no obfuscation present.\n   - The risk score, which reflects the potential impact or severity, should be minimal, ideally 0, given the lack of any reported or detectable issues.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation**:\n   - Without any detailed report or evidence, any claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity would be purely speculative.\n   - The empty reports do not justify any higher scores.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**: Based on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should all be zero, reflecting a benign status.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0",
