  "purpose": "Define a collection of color styles and color codes for use in styling and theming.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals representing color names and hex codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points where untrusted data is used or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code consists solely of class attribute definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes, 'STYLES' and 'COLORS', which contain static color definitions as string literals. There are no functions, input/output operations, or data processing. The content is straightforward and static, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign resource for styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static resource for color constants and styles, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
