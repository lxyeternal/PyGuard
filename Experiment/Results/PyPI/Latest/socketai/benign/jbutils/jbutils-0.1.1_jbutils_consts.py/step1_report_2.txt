{
  "purpose": "Defines color constants for styling and color values for use in a Python application, likely for UI theming or styling purposes.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments within the classes 'STYLES' and 'COLORS' which are static data definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only assigns static string and hexadecimal values to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes containing color-related constants: 'STYLES' with CSS style strings, and 'COLORS' with hexadecimal color codes. These are static, hardcoded definitions without any data processing, input handling, or external data interactions. No code execution, dynamic behavior, or security-sensitive operations are present. The content is purely data definitions with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of color constants intended for styling purposes. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The data is static, and there are no hidden or obfuscated components.",
