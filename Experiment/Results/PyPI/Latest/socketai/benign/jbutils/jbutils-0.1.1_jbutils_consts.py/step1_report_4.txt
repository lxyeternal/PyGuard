{
  "purpose": "Defines color constants and style constants for use in styling elements, likely for UI or theming purposes.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all data are hardcoded string and hex color values defined as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static definitions are isolated and not influenced by external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of static variable definitions for color styling. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, no credentials, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes containing color style constants with hexadecimal color codes and style strings. It contains no input handling, no code execution, and no network activity. All values are hardcoded, straightforward, and serve a UI styling purpose. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical style/theme configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static configuration of color constants for styling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
