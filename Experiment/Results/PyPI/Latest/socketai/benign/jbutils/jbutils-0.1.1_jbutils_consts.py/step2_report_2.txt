  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code consists solely of static, hardcoded constants defining colors and styles.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as a resource for styling purposes.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor point is that some reports mention \"style strings\" and \"color constants,\" which is accurate but not problematic.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The risk score should remain at 0.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely static and utility-based, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static collection of color constants and style strings with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
