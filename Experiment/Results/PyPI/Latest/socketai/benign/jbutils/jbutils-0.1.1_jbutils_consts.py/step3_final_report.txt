  "purpose": "Defines static constants for color styles and color codes for UI styling purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attributes assigned with string literals representing color codes and style strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants; no data flow or execution flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static definitions with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class attributes defining color constants and style strings. There is no dynamic code, input handling, external data processing, or network activity. The constants are clearly named and assigned standard color codes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely for styling purposes and does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe, serving as a resource for UI styling. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
