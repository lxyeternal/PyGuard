  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only static string assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; static data used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of static constant definitions. No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides color constants and style strings for UI purposes. It contains no user input, network operations, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a benign utility module for styling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, providing constants for colors and styles. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
