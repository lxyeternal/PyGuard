{
  "purpose": "Define a set of color styles and color codes for use in styling or color management within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Constants defining color names and hexadecimal color codes; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs present; code solely defines static variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows or transformations; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code consists purely of constant definitions with color values.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes with static string attributes representing color styles and their corresponding hexadecimal color codes. The definitions are static and hardcoded, serving as lookup tables or constants for styling purposes. There are no functions, external data inputs, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code appears to be a benign utility module for color management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of constants for color styles and codes with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
