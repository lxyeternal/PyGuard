{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for file I/O, nested data handling, list management, debugging, and clipboard operations.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (read_file), data passed to write_file, subprocess call in copy_to_clipboard.",
  "sinks": "write_file writes to disk; copy_to_clipboard uses subprocess to interact with system clipboard.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file inputs or function arguments into processing functions; no external network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'xclip' subprocess for clipboard copying is platform-dependent (Linux-specific). No malicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions with clear structure and purpose. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of subprocess with 'xclip' is benign but platform-specific, which could cause errors on non-Linux systems. No input validation issues or security vulnerabilities are evident. The overall behavior is consistent with benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is platform dependence for clipboard operations, which does not constitute a security risk but should be documented or handled with platform checks.",
