  "purpose": "Import the 'polygonprocess' function or class from the local 'reader' module, likely for processing polygon data.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'reader'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident; no external communication or data processing is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows are demonstrated in this snippet; it only shows an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit any unusual or suspicious patterns; the import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement, importing 'polygonprocess' from a local module 'reader'. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors evident in this fragment. Without additional context, it appears to be a standard import. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The code itself is safe but provides minimal information for a comprehensive security review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. It does not pose security risks on its own but offers limited context for deeper analysis.",
