  "purpose": "Import the 'polygonprocess' module from the local 'reader' package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a specific object or module from a relative package, which is a typical import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there are no input/output operations or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a simple import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard relative import statement in Python, referencing a module 'polygonprocess' from the 'reader' package located in the same directory. It does not include executable logic, data handling, or external communications. As such, it presents no malware, security risks, or obfuscation. The minimal content makes thorough analysis straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a standard part of a larger Python project.",
