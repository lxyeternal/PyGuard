  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware is 0, securityRisk is 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The import is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a basic import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues in reasoning.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** The low securityRisk score (0.1) reflects minimal concern, which is appropriate. Malware remains 0, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** Still just an import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that further analysis depends on the imported module's content.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.5, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — acceptable.  \n- **Justification:** Since no code execution occurs here, these scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no code execution or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No issues detected; scores align with the minimal code.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; straightforward import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The securityRisk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the context.\n- Confidence scores are high where the reports are certain; slightly lower where the context is limited, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of around 0.0 to 0.1 is justified.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (minimal, just due to import, but always good to review the imported module itself for potential issues)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. No modifications are necessary, and the code is benign in this context.",
