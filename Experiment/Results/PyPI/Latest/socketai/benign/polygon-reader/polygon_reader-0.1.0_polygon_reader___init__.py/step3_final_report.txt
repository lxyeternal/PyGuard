  "purpose": "Import the 'polygonprocess' function or class from a local module 'reader'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.reader'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data flow or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import pulls 'polygonprocess' into the current namespace; no runtime data flow occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The import itself is benign; any security concerns depend on the contents of 'polygonprocess' within 'reader', which is not provided. The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0, and very low security risk. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty that this code is safe. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
