  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk data retrieval and processing script with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The existing scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score can be slightly increased to 0.2 to account for silent error handling, but overall, the risk remains minimal."
