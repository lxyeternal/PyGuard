  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple version tuple assignment in an `__init__.py` file, with no input sources, data flows, or suspicious constructs. There is no indication of malicious logic, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is minimal and standard, with no errors or flaws identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable for such straightforward code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is trivial and free of suspicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent, sticking to the observable facts.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a straightforward, benign package version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate and consistent.",
