  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version tuple assignment, no suspicious code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that sets a VERSION tuple to indicate package version. There are no input sources, no data flows, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, nor any potentially malicious logic. The code appears standard for an __init__.py file in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code used for package versioning.",
