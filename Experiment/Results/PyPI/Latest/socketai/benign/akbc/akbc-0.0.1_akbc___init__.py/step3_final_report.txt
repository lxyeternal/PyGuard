  "purpose": "To declare the package version in a standard Python package initialization file.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static tuple assignment for VERSION; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file assigning a VERSION tuple. It contains no input sources, data flows, or suspicious logic. The code is standard for package versioning and does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
