  "flows": "No data flows; code consists solely of a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual constructs; only a version tuple assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single line defining a VERSION tuple, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no input sources, no untrusted data flows, no sinks, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The file appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python package initialization. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
