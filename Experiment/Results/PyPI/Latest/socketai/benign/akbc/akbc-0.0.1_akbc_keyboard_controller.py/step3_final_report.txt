{
  "purpose": "A vehicle control interface that interacts with CAN bus, cyber messaging, and user input to manage vehicle state and commands.",
  "sources": "Reads chassis data from cyber subscriber, receives CAN messages via socketcan interface, and user keyboard input via curses.",
  "sinks": "Sends control commands through cyber publisher, updates internal state based on CAN messages, and displays status on UI.",
  "flows": "User input modifies control parameters -> get_control_command constructs message -> message sent via cyber writer; CAN messages received -> decoded and stored -> displayed on UI.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected. Default configuration paths and device names are typical but could be misused if altered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard vehicle control interface using common libraries and patterns. It reads chassis data, processes CAN messages, and sends control commands based on user input. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's data flows are consistent with legitimate vehicle control functions. The only potential concern is reliance on default configuration paths and device names, which are typical but could be misconfigured. No external data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or covert behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by typical configuration and hardware interaction without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate vehicle control interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, reflecting standard configuration concerns rather than active threats.",
