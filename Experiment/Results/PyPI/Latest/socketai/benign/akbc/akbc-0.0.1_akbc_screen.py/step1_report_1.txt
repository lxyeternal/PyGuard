{
  "purpose": "To create a terminal-based user interface for displaying vehicle data, controls, logs, and CAN bus signals using the curses library.",
  "sources": "Input is read via curses.getch() in the run() method; no external data sources are explicitly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is sent to external systems or output sinks; display output is confined to curses windows.",
  "flows": "Input from getch() flows to registered callbacks via the listeners dictionary, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright date set in 2025, which is in the future; however, this is likely a typo or placeholder rather than malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No network activity, file access, or system commands are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a terminal UI implementation using curses, defining classes for window management and interface layout. It initializes color schemes, sets up several window sections for different vehicle data, and manages input via keypress callbacks. The code appears to be a straightforward UI application with no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious logic. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain compromise is detected. The only unusual aspect is the future date in the copyright, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal UI application for vehicle data display. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this module. It appears safe for use.",
