{
  "purpose": "The code implements a curses-based terminal UI for vehicle data, controls, logs, and CAN signals, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads user keypress events via curses.getch() and callback functions registered through the 'on' method.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks are present; the code does not write data externally or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "User keypresses (sources) trigger callback functions (sinks) via the 'listeners' dictionary; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward curses UI with no network, file, or external command execution. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. Callback functions are external but not inherently malicious. The code does not process untrusted input beyond keypress detection and does not leak data or perform suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the future date, which does not impact security. Overall, it poses minimal security risk.",
