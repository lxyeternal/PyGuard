  "purpose": "This script initializes and manages a keyboard-controlled vehicle interface, including UI handling, signal processing, and threading.",
  "sources": "Input options from command line (--enable_virtual_vehicle, --dbc_file, --device, --initial_x, --initial_y), signal inputs, and keyboard input (via curses).",
  "sinks": "Shutdown procedures, signal handling, and console output; no evident data leaks or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "User input and signals trigger shutdown functions that terminate threads and cyber module. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for UI and thread management with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes curses UI, cyber communication, and multiple threads for vehicle control, UI, and vehicle simulation. Signal handling ensures graceful shutdown. Input options are handled securely via command-line flags. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of external modules (akbc, cyber) appears standard, with no signs of malicious code. Commented-out code and straightforward control flow further reduce suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an application launcher and manager for vehicle control with standard threading, signal handling, and UI. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It appears safe, with no malware indicators or security risks.",
