{
  "purpose": "The script initializes a curses-based keyboard controller interface, potentially controlling or monitoring a vehicle simulation or real vehicle, and manages cyber data streaming and control signals.",
  "sources": "Input options via command-line arguments (--enable_virtual_vehicle, --dbc_file, --device, --initial_x, --initial_y). System signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM).",
  "sinks": "Shutdown routines for cyber, curses, vehicle, and controller; print statements on signals; thread management.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> initialization of cyber and components -> signal handling and thread startup -> user input or signals trigger shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors; the code is a standard control loop with signal handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a curses UI, sets up cyber communication, and runs multiple threads for UI, vehicle simulation, and control. Signal handlers are registered to gracefully shutdown all components upon termination signals. Command-line options configure the behavior. No suspicious or malicious activities such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications are present. Usage of cyber modules appears standard for vehicle data streaming or control. No code injection or obfuscated code observed. The code structure and functions align with a typical control loop for a vehicle system interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate vehicle control and monitoring interface with no malicious intent. It manages threads and system signals properly, and there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
