{
  "purpose": "The script appears to initialize a curses-based user interface to control a vehicle, possibly in a simulated environment, and manages threading, signal handling, and Cyber communication.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line options ('--enable_virtual_vehicle', '--dbc_file', '--device', '--initial_x', '--initial_y') and signal events.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the Cyber API shutdown functions, threading mechanisms, and curses screen shutdown. No direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Command-line options are used to configure vehicle and device parameters; user input (via curses) triggers shutdown functions; signal handlers invoke cleanup and shutdown procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. Signal handling and threading appear standard. The use of curses and threading is typical for UI control apps.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a curses interface and Cyber framework, then sets up multiple threads for screen, vehicle, and controller operations. Signal handling ensures cleanup on termination signals. Command-line options configure vehicle behavior. The shutdown functions cleanly terminate threads and Cyber connections. No unusual or malicious activity, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. All imports and functions serve typical control and UI purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard vehicle control interface with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It safely manages resources and handles signals properly. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
