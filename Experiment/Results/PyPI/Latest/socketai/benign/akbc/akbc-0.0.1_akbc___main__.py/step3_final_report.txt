{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a curses-based UI for vehicle control, manages threads for screen updates, vehicle simulation, and user input, and handles system signals for graceful shutdown, utilizing external modules for cyber communication and vehicle control.",
  "sources": "Command-line options for configuration, curses input, external modules (`akbc`, `cyber`), and signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "Shutdown routines for `scr`, `controller`, `vehicle`, and `cyber`; signal handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM.",
  "flows": "User input and signals trigger shutdown routines; threads run concurrently for UI, vehicle, and control logic; shutdown routines are invoked on 'q' key or signals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard vehicle control interface employing curses for UI, threading for concurrent operations, and signal handling for cleanup. External modules are used in typical ways. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code manages resources properly and handles signals correctly. External dependencies are assumed legitimate. No signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured vehicle control application with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to its control system nature.",
