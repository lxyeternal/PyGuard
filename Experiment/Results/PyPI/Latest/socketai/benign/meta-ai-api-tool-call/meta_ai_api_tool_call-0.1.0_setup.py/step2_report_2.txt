  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-checking with the code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- The code reads a `README.md` for the long description.\n- Dependencies are typical Python libraries (`requests-html`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `lxml`, `lxml_html_clean`).\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- URLs point to a GitHub repository, which appears to be a legitimate project source.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with high confidence, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious code are present in the code snippet.\n- **Code logic:** The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are evident.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Potential assumptions:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the script as a standard setup file.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical `setup.py` script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The dependency list and metadata are standard.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, safe, and free of malicious content.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The overall security posture of this package setup script is very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The package appears safe; no further action required.",
