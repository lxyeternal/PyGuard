  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package called 'meta_ai_api_tool_call', including metadata, dependencies, and package info.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or execution points; setup configuration does not execute code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reading file → setup parameters, but no data flow involving untrusted sources to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard setup.py pattern used.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All code appears standard and typical for Python packaging. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data or network interactions are evident in this script. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code are present. It is a typical setup script with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
