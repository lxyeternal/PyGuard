  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'meta_ai_api_tool_call', providing package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; defining package setup parameters, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; no network or system modification commands present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into 'long_description' variable; passing dependencies and metadata to 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for long description and specifies dependencies like 'requests-html' and 'beautifulsoup4'. There are no network connections, credential handling, or malicious code. The package URLs are publicly available and point to a GitHub repository. No anomalies or suspicious patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
