  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or handle untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies are common libraries, and URLs point to a public GitHub repository. The static analysis indicates no malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The current malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, transparent nature.",
