{
  "purpose": "Automation of Facebook/Meta login, data extraction, message sending, and interaction with Meta AI APIs, including session and token management.",
  "sources": "User credentials, HTTP responses, cookies, JSON API responses, scraped login forms.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests, cookies, tokens, response data containing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "User input/credentials → HTTP requests → cookies/tokens → API responses and data extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant definitions of get_cookies() and fetch_sources(), scraping login forms, handling of session tokens and cookies without validation or encryption, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code automates login procedures, manages sessions and cookies, and interacts with Meta AI APIs for messaging and data retrieval. It handles sensitive data insecurely, which could be exploited for privacy violations or session hijacking. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware are present. The repetitive code indicates poor structure but not malicious intent. The functions facilitate scraping and automation that could be misused, but the code itself is transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily an automation tool for Facebook and Meta AI interactions, capable of scraping and session management. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but poses moderate security risks if misused for privacy violations or unauthorized data access. The overall security risk score is justified at 0.4, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.",
