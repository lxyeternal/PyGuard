{
  "purpose": "Importing the MetaAI class or object from a module named main within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the current package to access 'MetaAI'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication observed in this line.",
  "flows": "The code imports a component but does not show data flow or execution of code, so no source-to-sink flow is present here.",
  "anomalies": "This is a minimal import statement with no obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single relative import statement importing 'MetaAI' from the local module 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. Since this is only an import line, no further context is available to evaluate malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any actions beyond importing a component from a local module.",
