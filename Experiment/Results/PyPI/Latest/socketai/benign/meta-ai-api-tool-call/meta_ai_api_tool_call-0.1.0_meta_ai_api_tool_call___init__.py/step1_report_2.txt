  "purpose": "Import the MetaAI class or object from the local main module",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module './main'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; import statement does not handle untrusted data or output",
  "flows": "The import allows access to MetaAI from main module, potential for further code execution not shown here",
  "anomalies": "Single line import; no anomalies detected in isolation; lack of context makes analysis limited",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component called MetaAI from a relative module. As a standalone snippet, it does not perform any input, output, or processing that could be malicious. Without additional code, there are no source-to-sink flows or suspicious behaviors. The minimal nature limits the ability to identify malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks in isolation. Due to its minimal scope, it cannot be evaluated for complex malicious activity. Overall, the risk appears negligible.",
