  "purpose": "Import the MetaAI class or object from a local module named main.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading from a local module file named main.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this single line alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement, typical for modular Python code. It imports MetaAI from a relative module named main. No malicious behavior or security risks are detectable from this single line, as it merely imports a class or object. There are no embedded or obfuscated commands, no external network activity, and no handling of sensitive data. The minimal nature of the code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe, provided the imported module itself is secure.",
