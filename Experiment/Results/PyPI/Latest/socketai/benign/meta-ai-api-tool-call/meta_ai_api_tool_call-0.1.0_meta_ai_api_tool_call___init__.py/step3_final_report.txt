  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of a simple import statement `from .main import MetaAI` in open source Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the imported 'MetaAI' class/object, though not present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'MetaAI' from the local 'main' module; no data flow or execution occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is a straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard import statement with no embedded malicious code, data leaks, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's benign characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
