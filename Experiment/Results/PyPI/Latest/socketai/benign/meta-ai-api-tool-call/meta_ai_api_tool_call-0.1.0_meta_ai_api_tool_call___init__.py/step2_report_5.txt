  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: `from .main import MetaAI` (or similar variations).\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no apparent data processing, network activity, or embedded malicious code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious behavior is observed or suspected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is just an import statement; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Errors or flaws in report logic:** The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the minimal nature of the code.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n  - Security risks are minimal, reflecting the limited scope.\n  - Confidence scores are high where appropriate.\n- **Potential malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is a standard import.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n- The assessments correctly identify that this code snippet alone does not pose security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the absence of any suspicious activity, and the consistency of the reports, I would suggest the following:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and no suspicious activity, a risk score of **0.0** is justified. The slight variations (0.1) in some reports are acceptable but could be standardized to 0 for clarity.\n\n**Note:** If the imported module `main` or the `MetaAI` class itself were malicious or obfuscated, that would not be detectable from this single import statement alone. The security implications depend on the contents of the module, which are outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious activity detected in the import statement.    |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.         |\n| Security Risk     | 0.0                 | No security risks evident from this minimal import statement.|\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The import statement by itself is benign. Any security concerns would stem from the contents of `main.py` or the behavior of `MetaAI` once instantiated or used elsewhere in the codebase.",
