  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet:\n\n**1. Confirming the code's presence and correctness:**\nAll reports describe the same code: a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .main import MetaAI\n```\nThis code is straightforward and consistent across reports.\n\n**2. Evaluating the reports' logic, reasoning, and conclusions:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a minimal, standard import statement.\n- They uniformly conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues based solely on this line.\n- Given the simplicity, there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns in the code snippet itself.\n\n**3. Scoring assessments:**\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the clarity.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which seems reasonable for such a benign import statement.\n\n**4. Justification for risk and malware scores:**\n- Since the code is just an import statement with no embedded code, data flow, or external communication, assigning a malware score > 0 would be unjustified.\n- The risk score is also appropriately low; the import itself doesn't introduce risk unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n**5. Critical observations:**\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about the imported module's trustworthiness are made; the assessment is limited to this line.\n- The reports correctly note the lack of anomalies and suspicious patterns.\n\n**6. Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (confirmed safe based on this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe import statement is a standard, safe, and non-malicious code fragment. Without additional context or code, there is no reason to suspect malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If further code or context were provided, especially involving dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns, reassessment would be necessary.",
