  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The code simply reads 'README.md' for the long description and sets package metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external code execution are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious code or behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives or negatives.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign nature.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is a conventional setup script, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- Reading 'README.md' is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n- No external data, network activity, or code injection is involved.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Personal estimation:\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe setup script.\n\n**My estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
