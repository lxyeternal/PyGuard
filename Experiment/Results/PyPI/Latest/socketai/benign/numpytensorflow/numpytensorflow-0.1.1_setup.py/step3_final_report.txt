  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python library named 'numpytensorflow' with metadata and description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; standard setup process",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' read into long_description, used during package setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of setuptools without dynamic code or external calls",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It reads a local file 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious instructions are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious behavior. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
