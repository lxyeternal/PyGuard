  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for packaging the 'numpytensorflow' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if 'README.md' contains untrusted or malicious content (not typical in setup scripts).",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content -> passes it to 'long_description' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behavior detected. The use of 'open' is standard for reading package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package metadata and build instructions. It reads 'README.md' to include a long description, which is typical in setup scripts. No user input, environment variables, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious or malicious constructs identified. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for packaging purposes.",
