  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'numpytensorflow' for distribution.",
  "sources": "User inputs for package name, version, author info, description, and README file reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and the open() function reading 'README.md' into the long_description parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. Use of open() for reading README.md is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. The open('README.md').read() pattern is common for long descriptions. No dynamic code, network operations, or credential handling are present. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package setup procedures.",
