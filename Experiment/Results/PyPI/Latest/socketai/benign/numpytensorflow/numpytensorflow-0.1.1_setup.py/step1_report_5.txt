  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python library 'numpytensorflow'.",
  "sources": "The script reads package data, long description from 'README.md', and metadata such as author and email.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network, system modifications, or dangerous code present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' to obtain long description; package metadata flows are standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated logic. Usage of 'open' is standard for reading long description.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration using setuptools. It reads metadata from standard sources and does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure and functions are straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package setup file without any suspicious elements.",
