  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to insecure transmission of private keys to an external endpoint, with structural issues indicating possible obfuscation or careless coding. The high malware (0.85) and security risk (0.9) scores are consistent with this behavior, while the obfuscation score remains low (0.2). Overall, the code should be considered highly dangerous and potentially malicious."
