  "purpose": "The code imports a variable or function named 'perm' from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from '.main'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network activity, or file writing observed",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs a static import without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a simple import statement with no visible malicious indicators or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement. No input sources such as network, user input, or environment variables are read. There are no sinks or output points. Without further context or additional code, this snippet alone shows no signs of malicious behavior. The import appears to be a standard package import, which could be part of a larger application, but as-is, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. No malware or suspicious activity is evident based solely on this snippet.",
