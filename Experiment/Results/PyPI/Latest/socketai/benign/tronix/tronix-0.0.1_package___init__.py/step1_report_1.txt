  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a local module; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, network, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this single line; import statement does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a relative import is used. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of 'perm' from the local module 'main'. This is a standard Python import statement with no embedded malicious behavior. There are no apparent side-effects, data leaks, or suspicious actions. The import itself does not execute untrusted code; it only makes 'perm' available in the current module scope. Since no further code is provided, no malicious behavior or security issues can be inferred from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal import statement, and no malicious or suspicious activity is indicated.",
