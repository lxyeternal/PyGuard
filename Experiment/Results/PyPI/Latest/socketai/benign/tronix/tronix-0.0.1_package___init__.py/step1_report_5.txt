  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'perm' from the relative module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only performs a single import statement from a local module. Without additional context, it is not possible to determine whether 'perm' is used maliciously. The import is standard Python syntax, and no malicious behavior is detectable at this stage. No suspicious code, external network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply imports a component from a local module, which is a common practice. There is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
