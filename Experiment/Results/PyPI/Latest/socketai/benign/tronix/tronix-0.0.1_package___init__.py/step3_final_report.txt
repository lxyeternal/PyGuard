{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main', likely to access a function or variable defined there for use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external data, user input, or environment variables are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or produce outputs that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import simply makes 'perm' available in the current module scope without further data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement, which is standard in Python projects. It involves no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data sources. The lack of complexity and suspicious patterns indicates benign intent. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, common pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence levels are high due to the clarity of the snippet. No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard relative import with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
