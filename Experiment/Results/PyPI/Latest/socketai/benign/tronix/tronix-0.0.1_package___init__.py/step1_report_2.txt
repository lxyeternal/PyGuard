  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads 'perm' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'perm' for use elsewhere in the application; no flow of data or untrusted input is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or anomalies. The import statement itself is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no data inputs, no execution of dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. Since this is a very simple snippet, it provides no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The lack of context limits confidence, but based solely on this, there are no indications of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code appears safe.",
