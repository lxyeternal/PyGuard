  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are about the same code snippet: `from .main import perm`.\n- The code is a straightforward relative import, common in Python projects.\n- No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code presence:**  \n   The code is indeed just an import statement, with no other logic. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n   - No errors are apparent; all assessments correctly state that this is a benign import statement.\n   - The reports do not overreach; they avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the nature of `perm`.\n\n3. **Scores review:**  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.8), consistent with the minimal code and lack of context.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n4. **Malware score justification:**  \n   - Since the code only imports a symbol and does not execute or process untrusted data, malware score should remain 0.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on an import statement.\n   - Without further context, no vulnerability or malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple relative import: `from .main import perm`.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is benign, standard Python import syntax, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
