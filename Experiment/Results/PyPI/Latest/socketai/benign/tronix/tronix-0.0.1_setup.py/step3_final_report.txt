  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'tronix', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long_description; static package metadata and URL fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static data assigned to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; placeholder URL in project_urls, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code. It reads a local file and sets package info. No network activity, user input, or untrusted data handling present. The code is straightforward and correctly implemented. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The placeholder URL does not pose a security risk. The overall structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
