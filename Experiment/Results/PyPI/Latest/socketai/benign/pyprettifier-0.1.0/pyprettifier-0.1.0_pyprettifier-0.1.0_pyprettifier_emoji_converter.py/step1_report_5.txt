  "purpose": "Convert emoji names to actual emoji characters based on a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'emoji_name' in the convert() method, which is used to lookup emojis in emoji_dict.",
  "sinks": "The return statement which outputs the emoji character or a 'not found' message.",
  "flows": "Input 'emoji_name' flows into emoji_dict.get(), which retrieves the corresponding emoji or default message, then returns the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No dynamic code execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to Unicode characters. The convert() method looks up this dictionary using a provided emoji name. There are no external inputs, outputs, or side effects beyond this lookup. The logic is simple and direct, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic emoji converter with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a safe dictionary lookup and returns the result. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
