{
  "purpose": "Provides a mapping from emoji names to Unicode emoji characters and a static method to convert emoji names to emojis.",
  "sources": "The method reads the input parameter 'emoji_name'.",
  "sinks": "The method returns either an emoji character or a message string; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'emoji_name' flows into the 'convert' method and results in a direct lookup in 'emoji_dict', returning a value or a default message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs a simple dictionary lookup with no dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to Unicode characters. The 'convert' method retrieves the emoji for a given name, returning a default message if not found. There are no sources that accept untrusted input from external systems, no sinks that send data externally, and no flows indicating malicious data handling. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious functions, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple static lookup for emoji conversions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
