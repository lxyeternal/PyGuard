  "purpose": "To convert emoji names into their corresponding emoji characters.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'emoji_name' in the convert method.",
  "sinks": "The return statement that outputs either the emoji character or a 'not found' message.",
  "flows": "The 'convert' method takes 'emoji_name' as input and retrieves the corresponding emoji from 'emoji_dict', returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to emoji characters. The 'convert' method performs a simple lookup using 'emoji_dict.get'. There are no external data inputs other than the 'emoji_name' parameter, and no operations that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The structure is straightforward and standard for such functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a benign emoji converter utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign emoji conversion utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maps emoji names to characters and returns the result. There are no indications of malware or security issues.",
