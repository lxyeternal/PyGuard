  "purpose": "A static utility for converting emoji names to Unicode characters via a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "The function 'convert' reads the input parameter 'emoji_name'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns either the emoji character or a default message; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'emoji_name' flows directly into the dictionary lookup, returning the corresponding emoji or a default message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with static data and no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to Unicode characters. The 'convert' method performs a simple dictionary lookup, returning the emoji or a default message if not found. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity. The code is benign, serving a utility purpose. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static emoji mapping utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
