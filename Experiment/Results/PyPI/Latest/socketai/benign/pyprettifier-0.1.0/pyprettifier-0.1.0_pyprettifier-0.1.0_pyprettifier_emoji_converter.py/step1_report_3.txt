{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to convert emoji names into emoji characters using a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'emoji_name' parameter passed to the convert() method.",
  "sinks": "The convert() method returns a string; potential concern if the input is maliciously crafted, but it only accesses a dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input (emoji_name) flows into convert() and is used as a key to access emoji_dict, returning either the emoji or a default message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The dictionary is static. No dynamic code execution or external data access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a static emoji dictionary and a class with a method that retrieves emoji characters based on input. There are no external data reads, no code injection points, and no suspicious behaviors. The convert() method simply performs a dictionary lookup, which is safe. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple emoji converter without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process external inputs beyond a dictionary lookup and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
