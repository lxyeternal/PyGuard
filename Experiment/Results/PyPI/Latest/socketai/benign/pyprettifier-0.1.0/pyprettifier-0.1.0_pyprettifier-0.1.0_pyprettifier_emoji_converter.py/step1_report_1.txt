{
  "purpose": "Provide a mapping from emoji names to emoji characters and convert emoji names to characters.",
  "sources": "The method convert takes an input parameter 'emoji_name' which is used to look up the emoji_dict dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The convert method returns the emoji character or a message; no external or untrusted data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'emoji_name' flows into the emoji_dict.get method, which retrieves corresponding emoji or a default message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No external network connections or code injections present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary mapping emoji names to emojis and a static method to perform lookups. The function is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no user input processing beyond parameter passing, and no suspicious operations. It does not store or transmit data externally. The code is simple, well-structured, and lacks any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple utility purpose. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
