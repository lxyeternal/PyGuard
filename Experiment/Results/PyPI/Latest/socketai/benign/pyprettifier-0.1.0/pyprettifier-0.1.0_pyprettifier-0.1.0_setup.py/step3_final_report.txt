  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "During installation, dependencies like 'requests' are fetched; no untrusted data sources or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Source: package metadata and dependencies; Sink: dependency installation process during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; static, straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code, network activity beyond dependency fetch, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Slightly elevated security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are conservative and not justified given the static, standard setup. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores should be zero, reflecting no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate; minor risk score adjustments to zero are recommended for precision.",
