{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'pyprettifier' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the package metadata and dependencies specified in the setup() call, such as package name, version, description, author info, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include the installation process that downloads dependencies (requests) from remote sources if executed in an environment with network access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from setup parameters (metadata, dependencies) to the installation process, potentially involving downloading dependencies via 'requests' during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward setup configuration with standard usage of setuptools. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies metadata such as package name, version, author, and dependencies. The only external action is during installation when 'requests' may be fetched from a remote repository. There is no code executing untrusted data, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior. The use of 'requests' is standard for dependency installation, not malicious. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
