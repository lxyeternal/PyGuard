  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pyprettifier', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static setup parameters provided within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not perform any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies ('requests'). No dynamic code, user input handling, or network operations are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies detected. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
