  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, network communication, or execution of untrusted code within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup configuration simply specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from setuptools to define a package configuration. It specifies package metadata, required dependencies, and compatibility constraints. All parts of the code are typical for Python package setup and do not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical setup tasks without any anomalies or malicious code. The package appears safe based on this snippet.",
