  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement in a Python __init__.py file, importing a class from a local module. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network calls, or data processing. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. No data flows or external interactions are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard for package initialization, and no anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The scores are justified and accurate.",
