  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious behavior. Dynamic imports are unusual but not malicious. No signs of data exfiltration or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The securityRisk is low, reflecting the minimal concerns. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard API with dynamic imports, but no malicious activity or suspicious patterns. No dangerous functions used.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent. The absence of malware and obfuscation is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard API with no signs of malicious code or suspicious activity. Inputs are strings passed into external module methods; no dangerous functions like eval or exec.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The very low securityRisk score aligns with the analysis. The malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; dynamic imports are noted but not suspicious in context. No backdoors or malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are reasonable. Slightly lower confidence but still low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard API code, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Internal module imports are typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. Given the code's structure and the analysis, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correctly at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The securityRisk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concerns. Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident, a risk score of **0.1–0.2** is appropriate.\n\n### **Additional Considerations:**\n\n- The dynamic imports within request handlers are unconventional but not inherently malicious. They could pose risks if the imported modules are malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n- The external modules ('omega_aidas.core.impl' and 'omega_aidas.core.ops') are black boxes in this context. If they contain malicious code, that could change the assessment, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is visible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (very low, given no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis provided in the reports and the code review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1             |\n\nThese scores reflect a benign, straightforward API implementation with no apparent security concerns.",
