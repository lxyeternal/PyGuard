  "purpose": "A FastAPI application providing deployment, status, feature implementation, and monitoring endpoints, importing internal modules dynamically within request handlers.",
  "sources": "Input strings from request models, external module imports within functions",
  "sinks": "External modules' methods potentially processing untrusted data, but no direct data leaks or malicious payloads observed",
  "flows": "Input data flows from request models into module method calls; dynamic imports occur within request handlers but do not execute untrusted code directly",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional placement of import statements inside endpoint functions; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward FastAPI service with multiple endpoints, importing modules dynamically within functions. No dangerous functions like eval or exec are used. The dynamic imports are unusual but not inherently malicious. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. External modules are unknown but assumed benign. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk (0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. The main concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if the imported modules are malicious, but no evidence supports this. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the low security risk score is justified. Dynamic imports are unconventional but not malicious in this context. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
