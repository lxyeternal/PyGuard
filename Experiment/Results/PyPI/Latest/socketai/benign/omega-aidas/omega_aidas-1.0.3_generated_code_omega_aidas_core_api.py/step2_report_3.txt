  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a FastAPI web service with multiple endpoints, importing internal modules dynamically within request handlers.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration.\n- The external modules (`omega_aidas.core.impl`, `omega_aidas.core.ops`) are unknown, but their usage appears standard.\n- No dangerous functions like `eval`, `exec`, or system commands are used.\n- Dynamic imports are unusual but not inherently malicious; they could be for plugin-like extensibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard API for deployment, status, feature implementation, monitoring.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; dynamic imports are unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is low but not zero due to dynamic imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar API, no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No dangerous functions or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No code injection or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score, which is reasonable given no suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar API for AI automation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic imports are standard but unusual.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.8`.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent. Slightly lower confidence is acceptable given the uncertainty about imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard deployment and monitoring API.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; no dangerous functions.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are `0`. Given the code's nature and no evidence of malicious activity, this is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All `0`, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2). The main concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if the imported modules are malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n**Final estimate for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (due to dynamic imports and dependency trust)\n\n---\n\n### **Critical notes:**\n\n- The dynamic import pattern warrants some caution, but in the absence of suspicious behavior or known malicious modules, it remains a potential but not confirmed risk.\n- The overall security posture appears strong based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further information about the external modules is provided.\n\n**My final assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
