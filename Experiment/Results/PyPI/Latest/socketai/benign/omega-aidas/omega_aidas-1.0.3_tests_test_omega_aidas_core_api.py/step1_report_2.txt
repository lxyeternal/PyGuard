  "purpose": "Test script for the /deploy-singularity API endpoint of a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from the import statements, system path modification, and the test client request.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to /deploy-singularity endpoint which could potentially trigger server-side actions.",
  "flows": "Test client sends JSON payload {'requirement': 'test'} to /deploy-singularity; server processes the request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a test environment for an API endpoint, importing necessary modules and app. It adds a directory to sys.path to ensure module import. The test function sends a POST request with a simple JSON payload to a specific endpoint and checks for its existence. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard test code for API validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for an API endpoint with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
