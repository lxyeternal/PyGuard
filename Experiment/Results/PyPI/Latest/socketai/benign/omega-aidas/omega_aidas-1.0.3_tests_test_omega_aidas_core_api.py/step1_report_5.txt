  "sources": "Import statements for sys, os, pytest, TestClient, and the application module",
  "sinks": "The POST request to /deploy-singularity with JSON data",
  "flows": "TestClient.post() sending JSON payload to the endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. The test only checks endpoint existence.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for testing, modifies sys.path to include generated_code directory, and imports the FastAPI app. It creates a test client and performs a POST request to /deploy-singularity with a JSON payload. The test verifies that the endpoint exists by asserting the status code is not 404. No data leakage, environment variables, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard testing code for API endpoint validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test script for an API endpoint, with no malicious behavior or security issues observed. It is standard testing code with no signs of malware or security risks.",
