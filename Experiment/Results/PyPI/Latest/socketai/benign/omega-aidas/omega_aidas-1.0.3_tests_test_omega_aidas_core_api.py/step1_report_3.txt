  "purpose": "Test script for deploying a Singularity container via FastAPI endpoint",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os, pytest, TestClient), app import from generated code",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to /deploy-singularity endpoint",
  "flows": "TestClient.post() sends data to /deploy-singularity endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, straightforward test setup",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for testing a FastAPI app. It modifies sys.path to include a generated code directory, then imports the FastAPI app. It creates a test client and performs a POST request to the /deploy-singularity endpoint with a JSON payload. The code is typical for API testing and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code. No external inputs besides the JSON payload are used, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test script for a web API endpoint with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs a simple endpoint availability check.",
