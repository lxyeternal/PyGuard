  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external data sources, dynamic code execution functions, hardcoded secrets, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, system commands, file writes, data exfiltration points, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution functions or network transmissions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials, suspicious complexity, or missing code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in reports 2 and 3, with suspicious behaviors like hardcoded secrets and network activity. Reports 1, 4, and 5 show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting benign or unknown status. The suspicion levels in reports 2 and 3 justify moderate malware and risk scores, while the others are consistent with their descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily in reports 2 and 3 due to obfuscation and dynamic behaviors. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with a recommended malware score around 0.5, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk approximately 0.65 to reflect the potential threat without confirmed malicious payloads.",
