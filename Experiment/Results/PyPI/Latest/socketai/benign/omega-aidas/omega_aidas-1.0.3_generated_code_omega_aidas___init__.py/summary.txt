  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily in reports 2 and 3 due to obfuscation and dynamic behaviors. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with a recommended malware score around 0.5, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk approximately 0.65 to reflect the potential threat without confirmed malicious payloads."
