{
  "purpose": "Set up a test for the FastAPI application endpoint '/status' using the TestClient",
  "sources": "Reading the 'app' object from 'omega_aidas.core.api', importing modules sys and os, reading environment via 'os.path' and 'sys.path'",
  "sinks": "client.get('/status') to send a GET request, 'assert' statements to verify response status and content",
  "flows": "Import 'app' -> Initialize TestClient -> Send GET request to '/status' -> Verify response data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code, standard use of testing libraries and imports",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and app, modifies sys.path to include 'generated_code' directory, initializes a TestClient with the app, and performs a simple GET request to '/status'. All steps are standard for testing FastAPI endpoints and do not include malicious behavior. There are no suspicious data flows or anomalies. The code appears to be a straightforward test script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard FastAPI testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a simple health check endpoint test without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
