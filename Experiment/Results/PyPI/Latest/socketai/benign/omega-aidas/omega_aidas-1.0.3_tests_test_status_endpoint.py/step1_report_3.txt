{
  "purpose": "Test the /status endpoint of the FastAPI application to verify it returns an 'ok' status.",
  "sources": "Reads the system path, imports modules, and makes an HTTP GET request to /status.",
  "sinks": "The GET request to /status could potentially leak data if the endpoint is malicious, but this code itself does not perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Client sends request to /status; response is checked for status and content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code appears straightforward. The import path is dynamically inserted, but this is common for testing setups.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies sys.path to include a generated_code directory, imports a FastAPI app, and performs a test GET request to verify the /status endpoint. There is no indication of malicious intent; the code is typical for testing an API endpoint. No untrusted data handling or obfuscated code is present. The use of TestClient and assertion statements suggests a standard test routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for a FastAPI endpoint with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign testing routine.",
