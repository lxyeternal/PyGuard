  "purpose": "Test the '/status' endpoint of a FastAPI application to ensure it returns a successful response with status 'ok'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, os, and TestClient; reading the app via import from a specific path.",
  "sinks": "The GET request to '/status' endpoint; response handling with assertions.",
  "flows": "Import sys and os → modify sys.path → import app → create TestClient → send GET request → evaluate response.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path modification to include 'generated_code' directory; no visible handling of untrusted input or dynamic code execution; no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules and prepares a test client for a FastAPI app. It modifies sys.path to include a specific directory, which is common in test environments for including generated code. The test function sends a GET request to '/status' and asserts expected responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward test script, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test script for a FastAPI endpoint. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
