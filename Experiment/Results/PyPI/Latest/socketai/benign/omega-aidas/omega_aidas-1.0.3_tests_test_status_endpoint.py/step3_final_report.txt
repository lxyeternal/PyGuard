  "purpose": "A simple test script for a FastAPI application, verifying the /status endpoint.",
  "sources": "sys.path modification, import of app module, creation of TestClient, GET request to /status",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "sys.path.insert -> import app -> client.get('/status') -> assert response",
  "anomalies": "Modification of sys.path to include 'generated_code', which is typical in testing but could be risky if the directory is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path to include a directory likely containing generated code, imports the FastAPI app, creates a test client, and performs a simple GET request to verify the /status endpoint. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The sys.path modification is standard in testing environments but could be exploited if the directory contents are malicious. The code's simplicity and the lack of suspicious activities support a benign assessment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), primarily due to the sys.path modification, which is common in testing but warrants caution if the directory is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test script for a FastAPI endpoint with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
