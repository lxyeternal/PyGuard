  "purpose": "Test script for the FastAPI application endpoint /status",
  "sources": "Reading sys, os modules; reading application code; reading environment path via os.path.abspath",
  "sinks": "Client request to /status endpoint, calling app from omega_aidas.core.api",
  "flows": "import sys/os -> sys.path.insert -> import app -> create TestClient -> send GET request to /status endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual imports or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and OS modules, adds a directory to the import path, and imports a FastAPI app. It then creates a test client and performs a GET request to the /status endpoint, asserting the response. All code appears standard for testing purposes. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or data leakage points identified. The code is straightforward and common in testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test script for a FastAPI application endpoint with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
