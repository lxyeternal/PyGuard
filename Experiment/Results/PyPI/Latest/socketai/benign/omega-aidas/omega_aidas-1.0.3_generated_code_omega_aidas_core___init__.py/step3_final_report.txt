  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, environment variables, network interactions, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, environment reads, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no evidence of malicious activity, with scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 justified by the descriptions. Risk scores of 0.2–0.3 reflect cautious assessment due to incomplete information or potential dynamic features, but no actual malicious or obfuscated code is observed. Confidence levels are appropriate, higher where code context is clearer. The reasoning across reports is consistent and aligns with the scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware scores of 0 are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate and consistent.",
