{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without explicit comments or documentation, the purpose is not entirely clear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not contain clear I/O operations such as reading files, network connections, or user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, data storage, or network communication if present; however, no direct or suspicious sink functions are apparent in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows, as the code lacks explicit data inputs and outputs or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. It appears straightforward with standard Python syntax. No malicious constructs like backdoors or code injections are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no evidence of data leaks, system modifications, or malicious behavior. The absence of external data interactions or unsafe practices suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems safe but provides limited context; thus, the overall confidence remains high but is cautious due to lack of external communication details.",
