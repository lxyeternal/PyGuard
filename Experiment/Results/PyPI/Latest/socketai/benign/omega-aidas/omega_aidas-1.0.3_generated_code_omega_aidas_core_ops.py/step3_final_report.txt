  "purpose": "System health monitoring and anomaly detection using optional external libraries for causal analysis and holographic data storage.",
  "sources": "capture_snapshot method from core.hmem, optional imports of causal_nlp.CausalTimeSeries and holographic_kv.HolographicStore",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or network activity; data is processed internally within the system",
  "flows": "capture_snapshot retrieves system state; causal_engine.detect analyzes anomalies; results are returned in a dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports external libraries, initializes analysis components if available, captures system state snapshots, and detects anomalies. It handles missing dependencies gracefully. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The data flow is internal, with no external sinks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security and malware scores are justified as zero, with a low risk score of 0.2 due to potential sensitivity of captured data but no active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs system monitoring, and does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
