{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'omega_aidas', specifying its metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author, description, package directory, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sinks; all data is statically defined within the setup script.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only assigns static strings and lists to variables used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a standard setup configuration with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions and calls setup() with static parameters. All fields are hardcoded, including dependencies and package locations. There are no dynamic or reflective operations, no user inputs, environment variable usage, or code execution beyond standard setup procedures. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, with no indication of malicious or suspicious packages. The comments are straightforward, and the structure is typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply defines the package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
