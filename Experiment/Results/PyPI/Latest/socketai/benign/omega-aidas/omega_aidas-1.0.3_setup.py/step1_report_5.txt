{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'omega_aidas', defining package metadata, dependencies, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'install_requires' list and package discovery via 'find_packages' in the 'generated_code' directory.",
  "sinks": "The setup process itself does not contain explicit sinks; however, dependencies installed could potentially be exploited if malicious. No direct untrusted data handling or execution is present.",
  "flows": "The script reads package configuration and dependencies (sources), which are then used during package installation (sinks). There is no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The 'package_dir' points to 'generated_code', which may contain other code, but it is outside this script's scope. The comments indicate version bumping but are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, finds packages in a specified directory, and declares dependencies. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. The dependencies include common packages for web development and machine learning, which are legitimate. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and typical for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues within this code. It simply configures package installation parameters.",
