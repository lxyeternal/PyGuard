{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'omega_aidas', specifying metadata and dependencies for package installation.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata and dependency list within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network or system operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the script purely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a setup configuration with package name, version, author, description, package location, dependencies, and Python version requirements. It uses find_packages to locate packages in a specific directory. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or use of environment variables that could be malicious. All components are typical for Python package distribution setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
