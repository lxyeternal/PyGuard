  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the omega_aidas Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, description), list of required packages, and package directory info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only configures package setup with static data.",
  "anomalies": "The author field contains a placeholder 'Your Name' rather than a real name, which is unusual but not malicious. The code references a custom package directory 'generated_code', which could indicate code generation, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies with static values, with no input/output handling, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The use of find_packages with a custom directory 'generated_code' suggests pre-generated code, which is typical in some build processes. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior within this configuration. The placeholder author field is slightly unusual but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. The only minor anomaly is the placeholder author name, which is not malicious but indicates incomplete information.",
