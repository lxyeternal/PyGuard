  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'omega_aidas' with specified dependencies and package location.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata and dependencies from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no code execution, data transmission, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package configuration parameters to the package setup process; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'find_packages' with 'where=\"generated_code\"' suggests package code is in a non-standard directory; no suspicious code or secrets observed. The code appears typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration. It specifies package name, version, author, description, packages located in 'generated_code', and dependencies such as 'fastapi', 'uvicorn', 'transformers', 'tensorflow', 'torch', 'pytest', 'httpx'. The configuration appears standard for a Python package setup. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The package uses external dependencies common in machine learning or API projects, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The presence of 'generated_code' as the package directory might suggest code generation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe for use.",
