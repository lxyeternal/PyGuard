  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and package location.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input or data sources; static code with hardcoded strings and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of package info; no dynamic data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'generated_code' directory for packages; placeholder author name 'Your Name'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, dependencies typical for ML/web projects, and no dynamic or malicious code. The placeholder author is unusual but not malicious. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. All signals indicate benign intent with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
