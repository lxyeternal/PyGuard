  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'opengrep', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sink points; no code execution, network, or data leakage functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only sets up package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py configuration with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation. It contains only package setup instructions without dynamic or external data processing. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The install_requires and extras_require specify common dependencies without harmful or malicious components. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling.",
