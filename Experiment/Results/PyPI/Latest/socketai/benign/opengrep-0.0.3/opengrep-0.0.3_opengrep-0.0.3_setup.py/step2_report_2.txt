  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup.py configuration with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code content, which is straightforward and typical for packaging. No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the absence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent with the code, which is a standard setup script.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the script is a typical setup configuration with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is static, with no dynamic or malicious elements.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the script is a benign setup configuration.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Given the benign nature, malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. Security risk is also correctly zero.  \n- **Justification for higher scores:** None needed; all assessments align with the code content.  \n- **Potential assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the reports rely on code analysis, not speculation.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a typical, safe setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- All scores are appropriate.  \n- No further action needed.",
