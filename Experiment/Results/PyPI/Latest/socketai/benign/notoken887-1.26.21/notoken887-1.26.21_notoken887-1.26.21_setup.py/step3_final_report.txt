{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author, author_email, url, and description.",
  "sinks": "Entry point 'notoken887 = notoken887.main:main' which could execute code when invoked.",
  "flows": "Metadata is read during package installation; entry point is invoked during CLI execution.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), unprofessional and potentially provocative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling. Metadata contains unprofessional contact info, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present. The entry point points to a function whose behavior cannot be assessed here. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; risk score is low (~0.2) due to suspicious metadata. No actual security vulnerabilities are detected within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with suspicious contact info but no malicious or obfuscated code. The low risk score reflects metadata concerns but does not indicate security threats.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
