  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package data via find_packages(), reads metadata (name, version, author, email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires), and entry_points for console_scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the console_scripts entry point could execute untrusted code if not properly controlled, but in this code, it points to a function within the package.",
  "flows": "User installs package; setup script processes metadata and entry points; console script executes 'notoken887.main:main' when called.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is a known offensive term, which is suspicious but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code actions. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The author email is unusual but not malicious. The entry point references a main function within the package, which is typical. No external network activities or data leaks are initiated by this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no malicious behavior. The main concern is the inappropriate author email, which is likely unprofessional but not malicious.",
