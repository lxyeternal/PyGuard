{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, functioning as a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken as a string parameter to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The data is transformed through character replacements within the methods; no external sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with emojis in encrypt method; emoji string → replace emojis with characters in decrypt method.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs character substitutions; no hardcoded credentials, external data access, or obfuscated code. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward substitution cipher using emoji replacements for alphabetic and numeric characters. Both methods are symmetric, allowing encoding and decoding. The logic is simple, direct, and free from external calls, network operations, or obfuscated constructs. There are no suspicious data flows or malicious patterns. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, such as playful encoding or simple obfuscation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The TokenCryptor class is a benign character substitution utility with no malicious intent. It does not include any harmful code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is a simple encoding/decoding tool that poses no security threat.",
