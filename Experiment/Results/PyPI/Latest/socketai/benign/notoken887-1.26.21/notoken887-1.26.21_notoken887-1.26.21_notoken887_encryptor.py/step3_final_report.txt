{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution encoding and decoding using emojis, primarily for playful obfuscation or encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encryption and encrypted tokens for decryption, operating on static string replacements.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications are present; the functions only perform string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential replacements in encrypt and decrypt methods, with each character mapped to an emoji and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward static replacement tables without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a reversible substitution cipher mapping characters to emojis. It is simple, static, and lacks external dependencies or malicious behavior. The replacement tables are direct and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation beyond character substitution. No external data access, network activity, or malicious code is detected. The functions are symmetric and straightforward, serving as a benign encoding utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward character substitution utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a playful or low-security obfuscation method, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
