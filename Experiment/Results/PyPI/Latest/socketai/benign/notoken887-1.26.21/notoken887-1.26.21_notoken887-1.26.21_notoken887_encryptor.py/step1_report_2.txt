{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption functions, likely for obscuring text data.",
  "sources": "The methods read input strings (for encryption) and encrypted tokens (for decryption).",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; no external or untrusted data flows are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string → replace characters with symbols (encrypt); Encrypted string → replace symbols with original characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive character replacement for obfuscation but does not include any network operations, file I/O, or external data access. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No evidence of malicious code, code injection, or malicious side-effects.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible character substitution cipher, substituting alphanumeric characters and some punctuation with emoji or special characters and vice versa. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic beyond the substitution tables. No external inputs, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be for obscuring text data, perhaps for simple privacy or novelty, but not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign character substitution cipher with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious features. It serves a basic encoding/decoding purpose without any harmful side effects.",
