{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption for text strings using emoji replacements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings to be encrypted or decrypted through the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods return transformed strings; no external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt', and output strings are returned. No external data flows or untrusted data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward string replacements with no evident obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no external dependencies or network interactions. It solely substitutes characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple substitution cipher by replacing alphabetic characters, digits, punctuation, and some special characters with emojis. Both 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' functions perform reversible replacements using the same mapping in reverse order. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions such as network activity, file modification, or privilege escalation. The implementation appears to be a benign, albeit weak, cipher designed for obfuscation or playful encoding. There are no external data dependencies, no environment variable use, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward substitution cipher with no malicious behavior or security risks. It neither collects nor exfiltrates data, nor does it perform any harmful operations. The implementation is simple and benign.",
