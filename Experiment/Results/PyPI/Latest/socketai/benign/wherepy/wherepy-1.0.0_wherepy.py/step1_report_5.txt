{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to locate Python interpreters on the system based on various user-specified criteria, such as directory paths, version constraints, and interpreter types.",
  "sources": "Inputs are received from command-line arguments, including directory paths (--search-dir, --python-home, --python-homes), version filters (--python-versions, --minimum-version), and other options.",
  "sinks": "The code executes subprocess calls to retrieve Python version info, and outputs found Python paths via print. No direct sink for untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects outside expected output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence directory traversal and filtering logic; subprocess outputs are parsed to identify Python interpreters; selected paths are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs system calls (`subprocess.check_output`) to gather version info, which could be misused if the command or input is manipulated externally, but in this context, the inputs are controlled via CLI arguments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly searches specified directories for Python interpreters, filtering by version and type, and outputs the results. It relies on standard system file checks and subprocess calls. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. The subprocess calls are used solely for retrieving version info, which is standard practice. The code's logic appears legitimate and safe, intended for environment configuration or setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for locating Python interpreters based on user-specified criteria. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs standard system checks and outputs data without any suspicious activity.",
