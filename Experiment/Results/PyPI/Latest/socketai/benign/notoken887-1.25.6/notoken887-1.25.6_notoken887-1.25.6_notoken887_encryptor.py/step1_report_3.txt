{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods",
  "sinks": "Returns of 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no external data or network calls",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace method -> output string; reverse for decrypt",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No external data access or network activity observed. The code is straightforward character replacement with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation beyond character mapping.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a symmetric character substitution cipher using emojis for encoding and decoding. The 'encrypt' method replaces specific characters with corresponding emojis, while the 'decrypt' method reverses this mapping. There are no external inputs other than method parameters, and no external or untrusted data sources are accessed. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The code structure is simple and direct, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious control flow. It appears to serve as a simple obfuscation utility, possibly for hiding text in a non-malicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character-mapping utility with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs straightforward string replacements without external interactions or data leakage.",
