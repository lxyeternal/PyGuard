{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation of strings through character replacement, likely for encoding data.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods read input strings and encrypted tokens respectively.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements, which are internal transformations; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed by character replacements in 'encrypt'; the resulting encoded string is reverted in 'decrypt' to original form. The flow is straightforward character mapping.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive character replacements but no hidden or obfuscated logic beyond substitution. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The functions are symmetric and simplistic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a symmetrical character substitution cipher with a predefined mapping, acting solely on string data. It neither reads external data sources nor writes to external sinks. No suspicious operations such as network communication, file access, or system modifications are present. The substitution appears purely for obfuscation or encoding purposes, not malicious intent. No malware signatures or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure is clear and consistent. It lacks any logic that could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n\nOverall, the code is benign, focusing on string transformation without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a straightforward character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is simple and transparent, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
