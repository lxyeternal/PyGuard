{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, acting as a simple substitution cipher.",
  "sources": "The encrypt and decrypt methods read input strings provided as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks such as network, file, or database operations. It only performs in-memory string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through sequential replacements in encrypt or decrypt functions, with no external or untrusted data flow outside these methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs character substitutions with emojis; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed. The replacement mapping appears straightforward and symmetrical.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible substitution cipher using emoji replacements. The encrypt method replaces standard characters with emojis, and the decrypt method reverses this process. The methods are simple, with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no indication of malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and symmetric, serving as a basic encoding/decoding utility. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flow, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward implementation of a character-to-emoji substitution cipher. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It is likely intended for obfuscation or novelty purposes rather than malicious intent.",
