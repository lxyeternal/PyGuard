  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption functions for encoding strings into emoji representations and decoding them back to original characters.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform in-place string replacements; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replacements in encrypt method -> encrypted string; encrypted string -> replacements in decrypt method -> original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward character replacements with emojis; no obfuscated code, external data handling, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses explicit replace() calls to substitute characters with emojis and vice versa. The functions are simple lookup replacements, acting as a reversible cipher. No external data input/output, no environmental variables, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution present. The implementation appears solely as a basic substitution cipher, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any system modifications, data leaks, network activity, or security breaches.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic character-to-emoji substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It exhibits no malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
