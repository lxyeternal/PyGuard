{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution via setuptools, including name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data flows present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static metadata without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional or potentially malicious metadata; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only anomalies are unprofessional contact info and URL, which do not constitute code-level threats. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting metadata concerns. The code itself is benign, and the metadata could be used for social engineering but does not indicate active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains no malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is unprofessional or suspicious metadata, which warrants caution but does not constitute an active security threat. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
