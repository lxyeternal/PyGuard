  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly designed for data processing or utility tasks, but without additional context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input sources such as files, environment variables, or network (if present). Specific sources cannot be identified due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, or file writes if the code performs such actions. No explicit sinks are evident without the code.",
  "flows": "Flow from data sources to sinks via variable assignments, function calls, or data processing steps. Not enough details provided to trace flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs detected due to lack of code content. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the absence of code content. Based on the prompt, no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns can be identified. The structure appears standard without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, a complete assessment requires the actual code to review for hidden malicious logic or vulnerabilities.",
