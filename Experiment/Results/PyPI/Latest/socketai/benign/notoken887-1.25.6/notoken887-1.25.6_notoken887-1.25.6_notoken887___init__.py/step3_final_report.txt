  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, external data sources, environment variables, network connections, and any code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into processing functions, with outputs or network transmissions as sinks; no suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reports indicate missing or benign code.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate no code or benign code with no suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high where code is described, and low where code is missing. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risks are minimal (~0.1-0.2). The reasoning aligns with the descriptions, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The scores are appropriate given the limited information, and the assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and the overall security posture is benign.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
