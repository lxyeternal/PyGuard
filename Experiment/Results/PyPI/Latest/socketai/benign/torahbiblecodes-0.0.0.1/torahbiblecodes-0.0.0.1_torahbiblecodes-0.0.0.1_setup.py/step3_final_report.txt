  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists within the setup() call, including name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static parameters assigned directly to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, unconventional version string '0.0.0.1'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or file operations are present. The empty author fields and unusual version are placeholders, not security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package setup script serving as a placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. The empty author fields and version string are typical placeholders, not indicators of malicious intent.",
