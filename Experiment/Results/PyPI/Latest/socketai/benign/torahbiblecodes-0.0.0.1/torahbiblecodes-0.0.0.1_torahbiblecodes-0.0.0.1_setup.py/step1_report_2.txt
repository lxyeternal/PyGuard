  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The setup script appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata. It uses static strings and lists without dynamic execution, input handling, or external resource access. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security threats.",
