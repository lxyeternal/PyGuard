      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits low risk overall, with notable suspicion in Reports 2 and 3 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 3 improves accuracy. The other reports correctly identify benign code. The overall security posture is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious review."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward command-line argument validation utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate. Minor cleanup of debug statements is recommended for production, but no security concerns warrant higher scores."
