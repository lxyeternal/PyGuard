{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and integer literals to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes variables with static values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode characters in a variable (__cake__), but no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting metadata attributes for a Python package. All values are static literals with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data interaction. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The presence of Unicode characters is benign and part of the aesthetic variable (__cake__).",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, only defining package metadata with no malicious or security risks present.",
