  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information for the Python package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments at the beginning of the module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sources or output functions",
  "flows": "None; all data are static assignments without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode characters in the __cake__ variable, but this appears to be decorative and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static metadata assignments for package information, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and a Unicode string. There are no functions, external data reads, or potentially dangerous code constructs. The Unicode string in __cake__ is harmless and likely decorative. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata defining package attributes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is typical package information setup code.",
