  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'ka_uts_equ' utility library.",
  "sources": "Static metadata assignments; no input or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or sensitive information exposure.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is purely metadata declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual characters in '__cake__' variable, but they are just Unicode emojis, not suspicious or malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments describing package information such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright. There are no functions, external data reads, network calls, or executable logic. The Unicode emojis in '__cake__' are harmless decorative characters. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package metadata with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign module header defining package information.",
