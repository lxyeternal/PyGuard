{
  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative Unicode character.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode emoji (__cake__) used decoratively; no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata, with no functions, dynamic code, or external data interactions. Unicode characters are used decoratively and do not influence behavior. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and benign, serving as package information. All reports correctly identify this as metadata-only with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk as 0, and confidence as 1, are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static package metadata with decorative Unicode characters. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
