  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'ka_uts_equ' utility library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns string and integer values to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward metadata assignment without any dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical set of package metadata variables, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or dynamic execution. The presence of Unicode characters in a variable does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clean, static, and serves to provide package info only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is unlikely to contain malware or security risks.",
