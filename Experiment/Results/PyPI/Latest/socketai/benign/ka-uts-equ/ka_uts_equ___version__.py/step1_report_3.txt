  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with static string or numeric values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; only static assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode characters in the '__cake__' variable, which appears to be decorative rather than functional. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of metadata variable assignments describing package information. It does not include any input handling, network operations, file manipulations, or other typical sinks. The Unicode characters are decorative and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and only contains package metadata information. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
