  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a straightforward command-line argument validation utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate. Minor cleanup of debug statements is recommended for production, but no security concerns warrant higher scores."
