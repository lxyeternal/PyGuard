  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits low risk overall, with notable suspicion in Reports 2 and 3 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 3 improves accuracy. The other reports correctly identify benign code. The overall security posture is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious review."
