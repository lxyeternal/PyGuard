  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'mos_text_summarizer' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependency requirements, and author information within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script without obfuscation, hidden code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and author info. All dependencies are fixed versions, and there is no dynamic code execution or handling of untrusted input. The code does not include any network operations, credential handling, or other suspicious activities. The content appears typical for package distribution and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
