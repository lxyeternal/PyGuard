  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration for 'mos_text_summarizer', specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input and package requirements specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and author information without executing or importing other modules. No malicious behavior, hidden code, or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The dependencies are explicitly listed and do not contain suspicious entries. There is no indication of code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The script follows typical patterns for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. No security risks are identified based on this code.",
