  "sources": "N/A (static configuration; no external data sources or inputs).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or output effects).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow; static configuration).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with explicit dependencies and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools to specify package information and dependencies with fixed versions. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, network operations, or obfuscation. All dependencies are explicitly versioned, reducing supply chain risks. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is static and well-formed, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications or further actions are necessary.",
