{
  "purpose": "This code imports a function 'run_text_summarization' from a local module 'text_summarizer', likely for performing text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'text_summarizer.py' in the same package.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'run_text_summarization' may be invoked elsewhere; potential sinks include function calls that process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly untrusted) could flow into 'run_text_summarization' when invoked, and output could be sent to logs, files, or network destinations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a straightforward import statement with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement, which does not execute any code or handle data directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is from a local module, and without further context, it appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or increased risk scores are warranted based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
