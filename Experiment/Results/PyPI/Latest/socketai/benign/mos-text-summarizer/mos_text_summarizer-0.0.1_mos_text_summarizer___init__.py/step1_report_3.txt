  "purpose": "Importing a function 'run_text_summarization' from a local module 'text_summarizer' to perform text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'text_summarizer'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no runtime data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing a function; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment only imports a function from a local module, which is a standard practice. No input/output, no dynamic execution, and no external communication are involved. As it lacks any data handling or execution beyond import, there are no security concerns or malicious activities detectable here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward import without any suspicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application, and on its own, it does not pose any threat.",
