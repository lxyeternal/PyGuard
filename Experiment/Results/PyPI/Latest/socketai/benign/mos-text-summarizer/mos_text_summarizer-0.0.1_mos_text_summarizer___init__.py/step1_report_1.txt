  "purpose": "Import the run_text_summarization function from the local text_summarizer module, likely for text summarization tasks within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The module import statement (from .text_summarizer import run_text_summarization).",
  "sinks": "The imported function run_text_summarization, which could process input data when invoked, but the code itself does not show invocation.",
  "flows": "Potential flow from external input (when run_text_summarization is called elsewhere) into the module, but no data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of an import statement, importing a function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. Without further context or usage of the imported function, no malicious or security concerns are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for a modular Python application.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
