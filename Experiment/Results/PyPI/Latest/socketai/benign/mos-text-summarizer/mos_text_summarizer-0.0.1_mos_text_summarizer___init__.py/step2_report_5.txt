  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is only an import statement; no execution, data flow, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and minimal security concern.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** Benign import, no security risk.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; no data flow or execution.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** Standard import, no threat.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No security concern.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are also correctly 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriately 0, given the minimal code and lack of behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
