  "purpose": "Import the 'run_text_summarization' function from the 'text_summarizer' module, likely to perform text summarization tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing 'run_text_summarization' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or execution beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated code. As it is only an import statement, it does not execute any potentially malicious code or contain any hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears benign, serving as a simple import statement for a text summarization function. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code.",
