  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the logic, and evaluating the scores.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic or data flow. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n     - Risk: 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; a minimal import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n     - Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, just an import statement, no data processing or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues with scores.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as previous; benign import.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Conclusion**: Consistent and appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same benign import.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports describe a simple import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note**: Since the code snippet is minimal and only involves an import, there is no basis for higher scores unless additional context or code execution is provided.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion**, the current scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
