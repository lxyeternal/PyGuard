  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .text_summarizer import run_text_summarization\n     ```\n   - The code snippet itself contains only this import, with no additional logic, data handling, or execution.\n   - Therefore, **no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present** in this minimal snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - They correctly identify that an import statement alone does not pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or over-interpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - The `confidence` scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, **scores above 0.5 are unjustified**.\n   - The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly state that the snippet alone is benign.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a straightforward import statement with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and presents no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious features. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
