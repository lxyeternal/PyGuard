{
  "purpose": "This code implements a text summarization pipeline using preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and SVD for scoring sentences.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from a file; loads stopwords from nltk; processes text and sentences within the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that send data externally; file writing occurs for output, but no network or data exfiltration code detected.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> preprocesses text -> computes TF-IDF -> performs SVD -> scores sentences -> outputs summary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries. No obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP tasks: text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, TF-IDF calculation, and SVD-based scoring. Eigenvalue computation uses power iteration, a common method. The flow is straightforward: input reading, processing, scoring, and output writing. No suspicious network, data theft, or malicious behavior evident. The structure and functions are typical for summarization tasks, and no anomalies or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of extractive text summarization without any malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious external interactions. No security risks are identified beyond standard NLP processing, which is benign.",
