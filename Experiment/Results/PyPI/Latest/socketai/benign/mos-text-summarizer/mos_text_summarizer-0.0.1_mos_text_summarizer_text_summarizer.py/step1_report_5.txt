{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to preprocess text, compute TF-IDF, perform SVD for dimensionality reduction, and generate text summaries based on sentence relevance.",
  "sources": "Input file reading (open in run_text_summarization), reading raw text, and tokenized sentences in Preprocess class.",
  "sinks": "Writing summaries to output file; no other sinks indicating data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Text is read from file → preprocessed (sentence tokenization, cleaning) → TF-IDF matrix computation → SVD decomposition → sentence scoring based on U and S matrices → top sentences selected and optionally written to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data leaks. The code performs standard NLP preprocessing and mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard NLP tasks including sentence tokenization, cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization, TF-IDF calculation, SVD, and scoring sentences for summarization. The use of well-known libraries (nltk, numpy) and typical algorithms (power iteration, SVD) indicates legitimate processing steps. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behavior is present. The code reads input data and writes output summaries; no suspicious or malicious operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of extractive text summarization using SVD. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. It is a standard NLP pipeline with no malicious intent.",
