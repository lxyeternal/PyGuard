{
  "purpose": "The code implements a text summarization pipeline using preprocessing, TF-IDF computation, SVD, and sentence ranking.",
  "sources": "Reads input text file; uses external libraries (re, nltk, numpy); reads and processes sentences and words.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data directly into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input text is read from a file, preprocessed, transformed into TF-IDF matrix, decomposed via SVD, and sentences are scored and output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears to follow standard NLP and linear algebra procedures without hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical NLP tasks: text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, TF-IDF calculation, eigenvalue computation, and SVD for sentence scoring. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present. All external dependencies are common NLP libraries. The eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations use standard iterative methods. The overall structure and logic align with normal summarization techniques. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of text summarization based on SVD and TF-IDF. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a normal NLP tool with no malicious payloads.",
