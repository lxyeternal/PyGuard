{
  "purpose": "The code is a collection of scientific testing scripts for processing crystal structures, properties, and deduplication within the Kim framework. It loads data from local files and environment variables to validate functionality.",
  "sources": "Environment variables influencing data paths; loading EDN files from disk; internal data processing.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; data remains within local scope.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and local files into processing functions; no untrusted external data influences critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'monkeypatch.setenv' is standard in testing; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific data validation, structure detection, and property management. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of environment variables is typical for test configurations. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for scientific validation and testing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
