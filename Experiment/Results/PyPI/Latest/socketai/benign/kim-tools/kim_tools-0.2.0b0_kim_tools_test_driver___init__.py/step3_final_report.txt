  "purpose": "Re-export symbols from the .core module to simplify API access.",
  "sources": "Importing all symbols from .core and assigning __all__ from .core.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from .core to current module's namespace; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward re-export pattern, importing all symbols from a local module and setting __all__ accordingly. This is a common practice for API surface management. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is evident. The pattern involves no external data handling, network activity, or secret management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. No malicious or security concerns are present. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
