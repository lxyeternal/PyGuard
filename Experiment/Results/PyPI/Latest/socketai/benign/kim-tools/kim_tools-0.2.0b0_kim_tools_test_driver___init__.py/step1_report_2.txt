{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting all symbols from the 'core' module, likely for simplifying imports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core, accessing __all__ attribute from the 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement pulls data from the core module; re-exporting symbols via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named 'core' and then re-exports the symbols listed in core's __all__ attribute. This is a standard pattern for creating a package interface, not indicative of malicious behavior. There are no input sources, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. The code's simplicity reduces likelihood of hidden malicious intent. No obfuscation or complex logic is present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code merely re-exports symbols from a local module, with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues.",
