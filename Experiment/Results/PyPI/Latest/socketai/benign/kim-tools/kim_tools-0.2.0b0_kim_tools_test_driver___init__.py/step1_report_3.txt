{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports components from the 'core' module, likely to simplify imports for other modules or packages.",
  "sources": "Imports all symbols from the '.core' module and assigns its __all__ attribute to the current module's __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports data from the '.core' module, then re-exports its exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, minimal, and only involves module re-exporting without any suspicious patterns or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from the '.core' module and then assigns its __all__ attribute to the current module's __all__, effectively re-exporting the core's public API. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The code structure is simple and standard for module re-exporting. No data flow anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module re-export and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
