  "purpose": "Re-exports all symbols from the .core module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local .core module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports symbols from .core, then re-exports them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns. The code simply re-exports symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named .core and assigns its __all__ attribute to the current module's __all__, effectively exposing the core module's public interface. This pattern is common for module aggregation and does not involve any data input/output, malicious behavior, or security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple re-export of another module's interface, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and standard.",
