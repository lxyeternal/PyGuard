{
  "purpose": "Re-exports all symbols from the .core module, likely for easier access or API simplification.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module and retrieval of __all__ from .core.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports symbols from .core and assigns __all__ to module's __all__; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import is typical for package internal structure; no suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named .core and assigns the __all__ attribute from .core to the current module's __all__. This pattern is common for exposing internal module symbols at a package level. There are no input data sources, no data transformations, or outputs that could leak data. No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package-level re-export mechanism with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions to simplify access to internal symbols but does not involve any suspicious or harmful operations.",
