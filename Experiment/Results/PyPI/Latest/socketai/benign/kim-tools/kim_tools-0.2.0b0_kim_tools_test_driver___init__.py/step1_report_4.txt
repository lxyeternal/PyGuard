{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports symbols from the .core module, likely to expose certain functionalities or API components.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sources or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports symbols from .core, then re-exports them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from the local core module and then assigns the __all__ variable to include the same exported symbols, effectively re-exporting them. This pattern is common for controlling module exports. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code does not perform any network activity, data collection, or privilege escalation. Its simplicity and directness suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to be standard practice for managing namespace exports.",
