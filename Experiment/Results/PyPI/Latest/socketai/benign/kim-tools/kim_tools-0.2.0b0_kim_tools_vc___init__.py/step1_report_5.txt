{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports all symbols from the module 'core' and sets the module's __all__ attribute to match that of 'core'.",
  "sources": "Importing all symbols from the local module 'core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports and re-exports symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .core import *' can obscure symbol origins and is generally discouraged, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a sibling module 'core' and then assigns the module's __all__ attribute to match 'core.__all__'. This pattern is typical for module re-exports. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of wildcard import is potentially risky for namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or secret handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward re-export of symbols from a local module without any malicious intent. The pattern used is common in Python modules but could be improved for clarity. No security risks are detected.",
