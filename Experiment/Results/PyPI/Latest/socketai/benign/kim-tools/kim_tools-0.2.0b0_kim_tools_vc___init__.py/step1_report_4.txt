{
  "purpose": "Re-exports all symbols from the .core module, including __all__ as vc_all, and sets the module's __all__ to that value.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module, referencing __all__ from the same module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None observable; the code merely imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward import and export. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from the local .core module, then assigns the __all__ variable to the __all__ attribute of .core (aliased as vc_all). It then sets the current module's __all__ to that value, effectively re-exporting all symbols defined in .core. The code is simple and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or security risks.\n\nNo external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The only potential concern could be if the .core module itself contains malicious code, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward re-export mechanism, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected within this fragment. It is a typical pattern for module interface design.",
