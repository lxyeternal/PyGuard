  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippet is a standard Python pattern for re-exporting symbols from a local module.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The use of 'from .core import *' is noted as potentially obscure but not malicious.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or secret handling are involved.\n- The only external concern is the '.core' module itself, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is correct and functions as intended for re-exporting symbols.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The pattern is common and considered safe in this context.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of `from .core import *` can lead to namespace pollution and is generally discouraged in Python coding standards, but this is a style concern, not a security flaw.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are detected.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, citing the use of wildcard import as a minor concern. Given the context, a score of 0.1 is reasonable but still indicates minimal risk.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident, scores of 0 or very close to 0 are justified.\n- The minor concern about namespace pollution from `import *` does not translate into a security risk but is noted as a style issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minor style concern, but no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe re-export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with only a slight concern about the use of `import *`, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the nature of the code.",
