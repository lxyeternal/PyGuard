{
  "purpose": "The code is re-exporting all symbols from the 'core' module, effectively making them available in this module's namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing everything (*) from the local '.core' module and reading the '__all__' variable from it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code reads the '__all__' attribute from the 'core' module and then assigns it to the current module's '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .core import *' can sometimes obscure which symbols are imported, but in this context it appears to be a straightforward re-export. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named 'core' and assigns the '__all__' attribute from that module to the current module's '__all__' variable, effectively propagating the public API. There are no apparent security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The pattern is common in Python packages for re-exporting symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard practice in Python package design, and no anomalies or suspicious activity are evident.",
