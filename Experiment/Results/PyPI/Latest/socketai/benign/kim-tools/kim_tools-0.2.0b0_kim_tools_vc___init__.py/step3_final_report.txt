  "purpose": "Re-export all symbols from the local 'core' module and set the current module's __all__ to match 'core'.",
  "sources": "Importing all symbols from '.core' and reading its __all__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Assigning __all__ in the current module; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import from '.core' -> assign __all__ in current module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .core import *' which can cause namespace pollution but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard re-export pattern in Python, importing all symbols from a local module and setting the module's __all__ accordingly. No external data, network activity, or secret handling is present. The pattern is common in package design but can be discouraged for clarity reasons. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security issue. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of this pattern, with only a minor overstatement of risk in one report due to namespace pollution concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not malicious. The scores should reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal or zero security risk score.",
