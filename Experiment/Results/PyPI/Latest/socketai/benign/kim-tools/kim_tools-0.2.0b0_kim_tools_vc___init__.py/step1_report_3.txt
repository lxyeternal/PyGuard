{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports all symbols from the '.core' module and assigns the '__all__' attribute to include all exported symbols from 'core'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core, reading the core module's symbols and '__all__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __all__, which could influence symbol exposure but is standard practice.",
  "flows": "Import of core module symbols → assignment of core's __all__ to local __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward re-exporting. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module '.core' and then assigns the '__all__' list to include all symbols from 'core'. This is a common pattern for re-exporting symbols in Python packages. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential concern could be if '.core' is malicious, but that is external to this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard re-export pattern in Python modules with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply forwards symbols from 'core'.",
