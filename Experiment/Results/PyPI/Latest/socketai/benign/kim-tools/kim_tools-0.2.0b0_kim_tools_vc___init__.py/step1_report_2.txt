{
  "purpose": "Re-export all symbols from the 'core' module for external use, essentially creating an API surface that consolidates core functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package's 'core' module, and the '__all__' variable from the same module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports __all__ from the local core module and assigns it to the current module's __all__, enabling re-export of core symbols.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward re-export logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a sibling module 'core' and re-exports the symbols listed in 'core.__all__'. This pattern is common for API aggregation and does not involve data processing, user input, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The code’s structure is minimal and typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard re-export pattern used in Python modules to consolidate symbols. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
