{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initializer that imports various submodules and aggregates their __all__ attributes into a single __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports internal modules and their __all__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing submodules to concatenating their __all__ lists into the module's __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and aggregation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, benign package initializer that imports internal modules and combines their __all__ attributes. It does not perform dynamic execution, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscation. The pattern is common and safe. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
