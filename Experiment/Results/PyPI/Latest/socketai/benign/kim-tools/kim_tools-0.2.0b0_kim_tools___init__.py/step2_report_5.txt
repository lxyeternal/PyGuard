  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module (likely __init__.py) that imports submodules and their __all__ attributes, then combines these into a single __all__ list for export.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, external data handling, or any suspicious patterns.\n- The code structure is typical for package initialization and module export aggregation.\n\n**Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor point is the pattern of dynamically concatenating multiple __all__ lists, but this is common and not inherently malicious.\n- No external inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0. Since there's no malicious activity or behavior, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code is a benign package initializer with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
