{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package's public interface by importing various modules and consolidating their exports.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and their __all__ attributes to aggregate public symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only consolidates imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements and attribute assignments with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves as an __init__.py file, aggregating symbols from various modules. All imports are straightforward and pertain to package structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer aggregating symbols for export. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intended for organizing module exports.",
