{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for verification checks, report generation, error grading, and file management within a scientific validation workflow.",
  "sources": "File reads for report templates and output files, directory creation for 'output', and data inputs for report content.",
  "sinks": "Writing report files, result files, auxiliary data, and console output; no untrusted data sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source data (templates, input parameters) flow into report generation and file writing functions; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for managing verification reports, error handling, and file I/O. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious patterns. Error handling is appropriate, and the logic is clear. No signs of obfuscation or sabotage are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in one report is justified by standard file operations, which are typical in such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
