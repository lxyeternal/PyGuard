{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper routines for performing verification checks, including error handling, report generation, and result processing for validation workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (math, os, sys, time, jinja2, numpy, ase) and reads input data from function parameters and external files such as 'results.edn.tpl'.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files in the 'output' directory, including report.txt, results.edn, auxiliary ASE configuration files, and x-y data files. Uses sys.stdout for console output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs to file outputs and console messages. Results are formatted with jinja2 templates and written to files. Directory creation and file writing occur based on the program flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries and safe file handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of utility functions and classes for verification workflows, including error handling, report writing, directory and file management, and formatting outputs. It uses common libraries such as os for filesystem operations, sys for stdout, and jinja2 for templating. All operations appear standard and consistent with normal verification procedures. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for verification checks, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It performs expected file and report management tasks without suspicious side effects.",
