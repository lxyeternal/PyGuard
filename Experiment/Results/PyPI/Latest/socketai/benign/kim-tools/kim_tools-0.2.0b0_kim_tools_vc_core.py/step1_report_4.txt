  "purpose": "Helper routines for KIM verification checks, including error handling, grading, setup, and report generation.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (os, sys, time, math, etc.), and functions within the module that process data and generate reports.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (write_results, write_aux_*, report.txt), and console output (print, sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters and environment, processed through functions that generate reports and write files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements structured report generation and verification routines. It uses safe file handling, standard library functions, and templating via jinja2. No network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration routines are present. It performs error handling, grading, and report creation in a secure and transparent manner. The code's functionality appears to be for verification and reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of verification routines with safe practices. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate verification checks and generate reports securely. No malicious or suspicious signals are identified.",
