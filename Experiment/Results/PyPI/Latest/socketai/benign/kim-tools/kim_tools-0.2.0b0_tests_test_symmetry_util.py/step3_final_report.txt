  "purpose": "Test functions for basis transformations and energy calculations of SiC structures using ASE and KIM.",
  "sources": "Atoms objects with assigned 'calc' (KIM) calculator, get_potential_energy() calls",
  "sinks": "Potential energy calculations, assignment of calculator objects",
  "flows": "Atoms objects -> get_potential_energy() -> potential energy values",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or data leaks; reliance on external 'KIM' implementation could be a trust vector",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific validation of crystal structures and energy invariance under basis change. It assigns an external 'KIM' calculator to atoms objects, which could be malicious if the implementation is compromised. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the 'KIM' class, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs legitimate scientific computations. The primary security consideration is the external 'KIM' calculator's integrity. If 'KIM' is from a trusted source, the code poses minimal risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.1 due to dependency trust.",
