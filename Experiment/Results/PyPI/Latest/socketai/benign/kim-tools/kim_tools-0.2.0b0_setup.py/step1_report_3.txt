  "purpose": "Check for the presence of external command-line tools ('aflow' and 'units') to support package functionalities and provide user warnings if they are missing.",
  "sources": "subprocess.check_output calls for 'aflow' and 'units' commands, reading system environment and PATH.",
  "sinks": "Potential warnings and print statements; no direct data leaks or system modifications. No untrusted data flow identified.",
  "flows": "subprocess.check_output attempts to execute commands, leading to warnings and prints if commands are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution. The code merely checks for external dependencies and issues warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to verify the presence of two external executables ('aflow' and 'units') via subprocess calls. If the commands are not found, it issues warnings to the user, printing messages enclosed by separator lines. The purpose is to inform the user of missing dependencies necessary for certain functionalities. The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and does not include any malicious or backdoor behavior. Usage of subprocess for dependency checking is standard practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs dependency checks and user warnings with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
