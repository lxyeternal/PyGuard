  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for unit conversion with a notable security concern: unvalidated user input passed to subprocess arguments could lead to command injection. No malicious intent or code is present. To mitigate this, input sanitization should be implemented. The current scores are mostly appropriate, but the overall security risk should be elevated to better reflect the potential vulnerability."
