  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email-sending script with security vulnerabilities related to credential management but no malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. To improve security, credentials should be managed securely via environment variables or encrypted secrets, but this does not alter the malware or obfuscation assessment."
