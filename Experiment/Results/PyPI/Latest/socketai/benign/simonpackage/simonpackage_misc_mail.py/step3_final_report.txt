{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to send an email via SMTP over SSL, constructing headers and connecting to the SMTP server derived from the sender's email domain.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: content, subject, from_addr, to_addr, account, password.",
  "sinks": "Uses SMTP_SSL connection to send email; credentials are used directly in login, which could expose plaintext passwords if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Source: function parameters (including credentials) -> SMTP server connection -> login -> sendmail -> quit.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of default plaintext credentials ('love2015') and default parameters that include sensitive information; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward email sender with insecure credential handling due to default plaintext passwords. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is present. The primary security concern is the use of hardcoded or default credentials, which could lead to credential leakage if the code is shared or exposed. The code does not perform any suspicious network activity beyond standard email transmission. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3-0.4) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting security concerns but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email-sending script with security vulnerabilities related to credential management but no malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. To improve security, credentials should be managed securely via environment variables or encrypted secrets, but this does not alter the malware or obfuscation assessment.",
