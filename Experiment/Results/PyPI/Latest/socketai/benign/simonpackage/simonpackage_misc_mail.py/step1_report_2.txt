{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to send an email automatically using SMTP with specified content, subject, sender, and recipient details.",
  "sources": "Reads sender's email address, recipient's email address, account credentials (password), email content, and subject from function parameters and local variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses SMTP_SSL connection to send email, performs login with credentials, and transmits email data over the network.",
  "flows": "Source data (email addresses and password) is used in constructing the email and establishing an SMTP connection, then the email content is sent through the SMTP server.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded credentials ('password' parameter defaulted to 'love2015') embedded in code, which could be a security risk if the code is shared or compromised. No other suspicious or malicious code present; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script's main function is to send an email using provided parameters, including sensitive credentials. It constructs email headers with formatted sender and recipient information, connects securely to SMTP server based on sender's email domain, performs login with embedded credentials, and sends the email. The presence of a hardcoded default password indicates potential security risk if used in production or shared publicly. The code otherwise appears standard for email automation without malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward email sender with a notable security concern: default hardcoded credentials that could lead to credential exposure if used without modification. No malicious behavior or sabotage activities are evident. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions.",
