{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal header for a Python package, including license information and versioning.",
  "sources": "SPDX license identifiers and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; no source-to-sink paths are identifiable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of SPDX license identifiers and version string is normal; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments, a version string, and no executable logic. It adheres to standard practices for package metadata. No external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The SPDX identifiers are metadata annotations and do not execute or perform actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a license and version declaration typical for Python packages.",
