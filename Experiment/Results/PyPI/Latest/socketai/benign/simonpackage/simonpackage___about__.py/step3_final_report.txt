  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as package metadata, including SPDX license identifiers, copyright, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and a version string assignment; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025-present,' which is inconsistent with the current year but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static snippet containing only license, copyright, and version info. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The only notable point is the future year '2025-present,' which appears to be a typo or placeholder but does not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only package metadata. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The current scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
