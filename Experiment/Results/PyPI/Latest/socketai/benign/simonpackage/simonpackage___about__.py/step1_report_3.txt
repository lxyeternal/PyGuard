  "analysis": "The code consists solely of SPDX license identifiers, copyright statement, and a version variable. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no indications of malicious behavior. The license comment is standard for open-source projects. The version variable is a typical package metadata element. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Overall, this code is minimal and appears to be a standard licensing and version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a simple metadata declaration, with no security risks detected.",
