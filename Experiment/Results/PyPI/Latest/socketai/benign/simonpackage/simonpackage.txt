      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate given the limited or absent code content. Minor adjustments include lowering the security risk score for report 1 from 0.3 to 0, aligning with the absence of code. Overall, the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for string manipulation and code translation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by the file writing function, which could be misused but is not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores."

The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. To improve security, credentials should be managed securely via environment variables or encrypted secrets, but this does not alter the malware or obfuscation assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily automation tooling with no inherent malicious intent. The assigned malware scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. Monitoring should be considered if deployed in untrusted environments, especially regarding subprocess control and exposed debugging ports."
