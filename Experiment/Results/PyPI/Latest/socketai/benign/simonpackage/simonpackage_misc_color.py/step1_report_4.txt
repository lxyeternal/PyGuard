  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating random colors in hex or RGB formats and converting between these formats.",
  "sources": "Random data generation functions (random.choices, random.random, random.randint), input parameter (hex_color_string, rgb tuple).",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that process color data, mainly string parsing and integer conversions.",
  "flows": "Random color generation → color format conversions → main block prints converted color.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no system manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for generating and converting colors with no external data inputs apart from random functions and function parameters. The random functions are standard and benign. The color conversion functions parse strings and manipulate numeric values, which are straightforward and do not involve untrusted external data sources or malicious operations. The main block only prints a color conversion result. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for color generation and conversion. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply uses standard Python libraries for color manipulation tasks.",
