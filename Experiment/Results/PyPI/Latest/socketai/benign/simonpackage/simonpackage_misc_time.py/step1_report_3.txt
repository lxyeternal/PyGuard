  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting time strings to seconds, generating JavaScript-compatible timestamps, and parsing timestamps to human-readable format.",
  "sources": "time_string parameter in timeString2Seconds, time_str parameter in getJSTimeStamp, and time_stamp parameter in parseJSTimeStamp.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "User input or function parameters flow through parsing and conversion functions without external dependencies or untrusted data affecting other parts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. Functions perform standard time conversions and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for handling time data: converting time strings to seconds, generating timestamps in milliseconds, and formatting timestamps into strings. All data inputs are local variables or function parameters with no external data sources or untrusted input handling beyond basic string parsing. There are no suspicious code behaviors such as network communication, file access, or credential handling. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious or malicious-looking constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard time manipulation functions without any signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe to use and poses no security threat.",
