  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between time strings, timestamps, and milliseconds in JavaScript-compatible format.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (time_str, time_stamp). Uses system time via time.time(), time.strptime(), and time.localtime().",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write or transmit data externally; purely computational.",
  "flows": "Input time strings or timestamps are processed within the functions, no external flows or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. Functions are standard utility conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic time conversion utilities, uses standard Python time module functions, and performs no network activity or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling. The functions accept external input but do not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to security issues. No anomalies or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for time conversions. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
