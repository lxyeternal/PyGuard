{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical functions for factorization, permutation, combination calculations, and a class to extract information from ID cards.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include integers for mathematical functions and a string ID for the GetIdCardInformation class.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks that could leak data or perform harmful actions. No output is directed to external systems or files with sensitive data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues. The functions perform calculations or data parsing without external data handling beyond standard inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on straightforward mathematical and data parsing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions and a class to parse ID card info. All operations involve standard calculations, data parsing, and object attribute access. No dynamic code execution, external system calls, or network activities are observed. The functions include proper error handling (e.g., for invalid n in P and C functions). The ID class parses specific segments of the ID string without suspicious logic. Overall, the code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of mathematical utilities and ID parsing logic. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected. It does not perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification.",
