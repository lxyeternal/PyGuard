{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical utilities for number analysis, factorization, permutation, combination calculations, and extraction of information from an ID number.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters and the ID string in the GetIdCardInformation class.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (function parameters, ID string) through processing functions without any external data or untrusted sources leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and mathematically oriented. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple mathematical functions for factors, primality, permutations, and combinations, all based on standard calculations. The GetIdCardInformation class parses ID strings to extract birth date, sex, and age, using straightforward string slicing and date calculations. No external data sources, network operations, or system commands are invoked. The code lacks any malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern is the handling of ID strings, but given the context, it appears to be a standard utility class. Overall, the code is legitimate utility code with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical and data extraction utilities with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe for use in applications requiring number theory computations and ID parsing.",
