{
  "purpose": "The code provides various mathematical functions for number analysis, including prime factorization, permutations, combinations, and factors, along with a class to extract information from ID card strings.",
  "sources": "The ID string input in GetIdCardInformation class; standard library functions such as datetime and math.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not perform any network operations, file access, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input ID data flows from class instantiation to data extraction methods; mathematical functions process input numbers locally without external dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious code patterns detected; functions perform standard mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The script includes basic mathematical functions and a class for extracting demographic info from ID strings. It uses standard Python libraries and performs operations such as factorization, permutation, combination, and date calculations. The code does not include any network communication, data leakage, or suspicious logic. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security breaches are present. All functions seem to serve legitimate mathematical purposes. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for mathematical operations and ID card data parsing with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
