{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical functions for factorization, permutation, combination, and a class to extract information from ID card numbers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided ID strings for the GetIdCardInformation class and parameters for mathematical functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code performs internal calculations and returns results.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input parameters through various mathematical functions and class methods, with no external or untrusted data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions for intended purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic mathematical functions such as factorization, permutation, and combination, and includes a class for extracting personal information from ID card strings. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. All functions appear to serve legitimate computational purposes. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions and a data extraction class without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical and data parsing operations securely and transparently.",
