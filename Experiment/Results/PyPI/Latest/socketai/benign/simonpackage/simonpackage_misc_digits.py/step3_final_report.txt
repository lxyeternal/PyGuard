{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical utilities such as calculating number length, factors, prime factors, permutations, combinations, and parsing ID card information including birth date, sex, and age.",
  "sources": "ID string parsing in GetIdCardInformation class, mathematical functions taking integer inputs",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions; data is processed internally without external communication",
  "flows": "Input ID string flows into GetIdCardInformation methods for data extraction; numerical inputs flow through mathematical functions for calculations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical calculations and ID data parsing without external dependencies or malicious behaviors. Functions like factors, primeFactors, and fullFactors are correctly implemented, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The ID parsing class extracts data based on fixed string positions without validation, but this does not constitute malicious activity. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and serves legitimate utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are straightforward, and the ID parsing is simple and non-malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0.",
