  "conclusion": "The code is primarily automation tooling with no inherent malicious intent. The assigned malware scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. Monitoring should be considered if deployed in untrusted environments, especially regarding subprocess control and exposed debugging ports."
