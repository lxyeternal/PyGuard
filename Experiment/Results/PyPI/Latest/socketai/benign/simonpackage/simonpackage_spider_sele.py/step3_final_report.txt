{
  "purpose": "The code provides web automation functionalities including login, cookie management, CAPTCHA solving via OCR, and logging, primarily for testing or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "File reads for cookies and logs, subprocess calls to launch Chrome/Chromium with remote debugging, input from user or external sources via Selenium interactions.",
  "sinks": "Cookies stored and loaded from JSON files, logs written to text files, subprocess commands controlling browser instances, OCR outputs used for CAPTCHA input.",
  "flows": "Input data (cookies, logs, OCR images) flow from file reads or external interactions into browser automation functions; subprocess commands initiate browser sessions; OCR results flow into login or verification steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to launch browsers with remote debugging ports, regex-based cookie expiry extension, default credentials in class parameters, no encryption or validation of sensitive data, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured for automation with Selenium, managing cookies, and CAPTCHA bypass. Subprocess commands for remote debugging are standard but could be exploited if ports are exposed externally. Cookie expiry manipulation via regex is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets (beyond placeholders), no obfuscated or malicious code, and no signs of sabotage or backdoors. The security risks are mainly associated with subprocess control and potential misuse of automation features, but these are typical in such scripts. The malware score is set to 0 or very low, consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. The risk scores are moderate, justified by automation capabilities and subprocess usage, but overall the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily automation tooling with no inherent malicious intent. The assigned malware scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. Monitoring should be considered if deployed in untrusted environments, especially regarding subprocess control and exposed debugging ports.",
