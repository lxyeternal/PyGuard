  "purpose": "The code aims to identify available Chinese fonts on the system by comparing predefined font lists with system fonts.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() reads the list of font files from system font directories.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs are directly used to send data over the network or write sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input from os.listdir() flows into list comparisons to find intersection of font lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines font lists for Linux and Windows, constructs font filenames, retrieves system font directories, lists font files, and finds common fonts. All operations are straightforward, with no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. It functions solely to identify available Chinese fonts, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign font detection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
