  "purpose": "Detect supported Chinese fonts installed on the system by comparing predefined font lists with actual system fonts.",
  "sources": "Uses LabelBase.get_system_fonts_dir() to retrieve font directories; reads font files with os.listdir() from these directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only filesystem reads and list operations.",
  "flows": "Retrieves font directories -> lists font files -> filters by extension -> intersects with predefined font lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem operations to identify available Chinese fonts by comparing system fonts with predefined lists. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign font detection utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal filesystem access is standard and not security-critical.",
