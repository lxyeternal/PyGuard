{
  "purpose": "The code aims to identify supported Chinese fonts installed on the system by comparing predefined font lists with system fonts.",
  "sources": "The code reads font files from system font directories using LabelBase.get_system_fonts_dir() and os.listdir() to list files in those directories.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any untrusted data outputs or network transmissions; it only reads font files from the local system.",
  "flows": "The code collects font filenames from system directories, filters by extension, and intersects with predefined font lists to identify available fonts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code only performs filesystem operations and data filtering. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a Kivy library, defines dictionaries of known Chinese fonts for Linux and Windows, and implements a function to find supported fonts. It gathers system font directories via Kivy's LabelBase.get_system_fonts_dir(), then lists and filters font files. It compares these with predefined font lists to determine available fonts. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate font detection utility with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign font detection script intended to identify supported Chinese fonts on the system. It performs filesystem operations safely without malicious intent or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware identified.",
