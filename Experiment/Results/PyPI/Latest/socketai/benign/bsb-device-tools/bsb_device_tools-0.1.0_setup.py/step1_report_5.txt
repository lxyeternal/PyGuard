  "flows": "Reading setup parameters -> installing dependencies -> creating command-line entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious instructions are present. The code adheres to standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a setup() call with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input handling, network operations, or code execution beyond standard packaging procedures are present. The author_email and URL are publicly available metadata, not suspicious. The dependencies listed are common libraries (click, colorama, cryptography). There are no obfuscated or dynamic code segments. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file is a standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments; it appears legitimate and safe.",
