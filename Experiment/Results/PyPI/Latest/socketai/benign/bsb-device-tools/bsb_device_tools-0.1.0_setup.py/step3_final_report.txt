  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for 'bsb-device-tools', defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static dependencies, package discovery, and CLI entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or security-sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data flows from file reading and dependency declarations to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated, encrypted, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. It reads a local README file without validation, which is common. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are standard libraries, and the author information is generic. The code structure is clear and typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The overall security posture is minimal risk, and no further action is necessary.",
