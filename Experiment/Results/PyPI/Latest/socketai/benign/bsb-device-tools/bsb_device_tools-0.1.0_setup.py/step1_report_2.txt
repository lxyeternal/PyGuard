{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'bsb-device-tools'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function (package metadata, dependencies, entry points).",
  "sinks": "None; setup.py primarily declares package info and dependencies, no runtime data processing or external input/output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script executes statically without dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code patterns detected. The URL points to a GitHub repository, and author info appears generic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static parameters, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI. No user input, network operations, or executable code execution occurs. The package description suggests remote control tools, but this alone is not malicious. All components are standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py appears to be a standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package info and dependencies for distribution.",
