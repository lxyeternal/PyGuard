  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the script is standard, with no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, or network activity.\n- Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- This aligns with the analysis; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also finds the script to be a typical setup configuration, with no malicious behaviors.\n- Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the script is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Accurate given the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Notes the only dynamic part is reading 'README.md', which is standard.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also describes the script as a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree the code is a standard setup.py script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None identified.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- This is reasonable given the code's simplicity and standard structure.\n- No report suggests any behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup.py script is a standard, benign packaging script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future versions or related code include dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
