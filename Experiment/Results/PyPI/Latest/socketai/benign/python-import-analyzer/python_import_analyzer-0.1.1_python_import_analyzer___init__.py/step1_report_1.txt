  "purpose": "A Python package for analyzing and visualizing import dependencies in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module (.dependency_analyzer) and version assignment",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily import and assignment statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed; the code is straightforward and modular",
  "analysis": "The code defines versioning and imports several functions from a local module for dependency analysis and visualization. It declares __all__ to specify exported symbols. No user input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard package module setup without any malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated parts, hidden code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for dependency analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for a Python package, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
