{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package module for analyzing and visualizing import dependencies in Python projects.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No potential data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes functions from a dependency analyzer module.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No dynamic execution, eval, exec, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string, imports specific functions from a local module (.dependency_analyzer), and defines __all__ for exports. All elements follow typical package structure. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and clean, serving as an interface for dependency analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only exposes functions for dependency analysis without any suspicious operations.",
