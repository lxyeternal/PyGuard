  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence of Issues**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer (`__init__.py` style), importing functions from a local module and defining `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code is static, standard, and contains no user input, network activity, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Obfuscated score (0)**: Appropriate; no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Malware score (0)**: Correct; no malicious behavior or payloads observed.  \n- **Security risk score (0)**: Correct; the code is a benign package setup without vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification**:  \nAll reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified given the code's nature. No external inputs, no sensitive operations, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll claims are based on direct code analysis, not assumptions. The code is static and standard.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's characteristics. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package module for dependency analysis. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No evidence suggests any security threat or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe overall assessment aligns with the provided reports. No changes are necessary.",
