  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python package `__init__.py` file.\n- It defines a version string.\n- It imports several functions from a local module `.dependency_analyzer`.\n- It declares `__all__` to specify exported symbols.\n- There are no user inputs, environment variables, network operations, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward, modular, and serves as an interface for dependency analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code is purely a package initializer with no suspicious or malicious content, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 aligns with the findings.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  All reports have high confidence (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a standard Python package setup module.**  \n- **No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior detected.**  \n- **Scores are consistent with the code's nature.**\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. All indicators point to a safe, standard package initialization module.",
