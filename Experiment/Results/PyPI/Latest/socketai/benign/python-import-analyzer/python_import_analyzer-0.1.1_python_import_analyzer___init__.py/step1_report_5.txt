  "purpose": "This module provides functions for analyzing and visualizing import dependencies in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports functions from a local module (.dependency_analyzer).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data; it only exposes imported functions and defines a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The version string is standard. Import statements are normal for such a utility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing functions from a local module and defining an __all__ list for exports. It includes a version string for package versioning. No input, output, or network activity occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual patterns. The module appears to be a benign utility for dependency analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely imports and exposes functions for dependency analysis and visualization. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
