{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for analyzing and visualizing import dependencies in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from a relative module (.dependency_analyzer), version string assignment, list defining __all__ for exports.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file manipulations are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The version string and export list are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata and imports functions from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. It appears to be a straightforward, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions to set up and expose certain dependency analysis functions for external use.",
