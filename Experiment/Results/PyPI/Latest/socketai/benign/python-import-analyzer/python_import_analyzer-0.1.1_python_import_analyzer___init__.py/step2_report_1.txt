  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**  \n   All reports consistently identify that the code is a straightforward module setup, importing functions from a local module and defining `__all__`. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The code does not handle user input, network operations, or sensitive data.\n\n2. **Code content verification:**  \n   The code only contains:\n   - A docstring describing its purpose.\n   - A version string.\n   - Imports from a local module (`.dependency_analyzer`).\n   - An `__all__` list exporting functions.\n\n   No evidence suggests any malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module entry point.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not assume any hidden behavior; they recognize the code as benign. No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Final assessment:**  \n   Given the code and reports, the actual risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should be **0**. The code is a standard, benign package setup with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No further action needed.",
