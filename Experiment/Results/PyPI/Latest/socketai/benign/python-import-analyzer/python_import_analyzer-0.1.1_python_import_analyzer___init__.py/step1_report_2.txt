{
  "purpose": "The code provides an import analysis tool for visualizing and analyzing Python project dependencies.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read. Imports are static within the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No network, file, or environment manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks. The code only defines metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string, imports multiple functions from a local module, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It is purely declarative, providing metadata and interface exposure. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are identified. No external or dynamic code execution is present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module defining metadata and exporting functions for dependency analysis visualization. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk.",
