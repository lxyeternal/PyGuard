  "purpose": "A simple Python package initializer that imports functions from a local module and defines __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .dependency_analyzer, version string, and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration without dynamic execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py, importing functions from a local module, defining a version, and setting __all__. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
