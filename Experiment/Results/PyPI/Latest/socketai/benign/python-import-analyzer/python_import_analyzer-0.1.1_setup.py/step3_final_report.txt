  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies; entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package installation; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, and console scripts. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's static and straightforward nature supports these conclusions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
