{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'python-import-analyzer' Python project, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; retrieves package dependencies; defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data used at runtime, no user input or external untrusted sources processed.",
  "flows": "N/A – static setup configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior observed. Standard use of setuptools for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a README file for documentation, specifies dependencies like networkx, matplotlib, plotly, dash, pandas, and sets up a console script. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. All components are typical for a Python package setup, and no dynamic execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal package setup configuration with no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks detected. It performs standard package installation tasks without any indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
