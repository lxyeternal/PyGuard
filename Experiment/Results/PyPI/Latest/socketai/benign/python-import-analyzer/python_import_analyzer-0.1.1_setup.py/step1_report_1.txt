  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'python-import-analyzer' that facilitates visualizing and analyzing import dependencies in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'setuptools' and using 'find_packages()'; reading package metadata and dependencies; defining entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() which installs dependencies, registers package metadata, and creates command-line interfaces.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() invocation -> installation and registration of package components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly performs standard setup operations without any unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and console scripts. There are no external data sources or untrusted inputs processed at runtime beyond standard package configuration. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities are present. All operations are straightforward package setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata, dependencies, and command-line entry points.",
