  "sources": "Reading README.md file, defining setup parameters, specifying dependencies, and entry points",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content used in long_description, setup configuration parameters passed to setuptools",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or hidden behavior detected; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a README file for description, specifies package info, dependencies, and console scripts. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns observed. All operations are typical for a setup.py script intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
