{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'python-import-analyzer', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; static code defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "N/A – all data is static or file-based configuration without dynamic execution or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The package metadata and dependencies are typical for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration using setuptools, reading a markdown file for description and specifying dependencies and entry points. No code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs here. All parts are static configuration. The entry point references a module and function, but nothing suggests malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and typical for a Python package. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
