{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python project dependencies by extracting import statements, mapping modules to files, building a dependency graph, and visualizing dependencies interactively or statically.",
  "sources": "File system reads for Python files; reading and parsing files with ast to extract import statements; potentially dynamic imports if any, but none explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Graph visualization functions; no evident data leaks or untrusted data sinks; no network communication, file modification, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Python files are read and parsed (sources), import statements are extracted (initial step), dependencies are mapped to graph nodes (processing), visualizations are generated based on graph data (output).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily performs static analysis and visualization. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static analysis of a Python project directory, extracting import statements, mapping modules, and constructing a dependency graph. Visualization functions generate static or interactive dependency diagrams. All operations are consistent with code analysis and visualization tasks, with no malicious behaviors or suspicious activities observed. The code uses standard libraries and common practices for dependency analysis and visualization. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of plotting libraries is solely for visualization purposes, and no code injection or external data exfiltration mechanisms are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a dependency analysis and visualization tool for Python projects, with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It performs static file parsing and visualization without executing or transmitting untrusted data. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible.",
