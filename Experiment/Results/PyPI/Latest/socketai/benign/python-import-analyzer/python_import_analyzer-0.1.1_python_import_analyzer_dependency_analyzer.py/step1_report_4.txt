{
  "purpose": "This code analyzes Python project dependencies by extracting import statements, building a dependency graph, and visualizing it interactively or statically.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python files from the specified directory using 'open' with UTF-8 encoding, primarily in the 'extract_imports' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input data for execution, network, or data exfiltration. No system commands, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python source files, parses import statements, constructs a dependency graph, and visualizes it. Data flows from file reading to parsing, graph building, and visualization. No untrusted data is directed towards sensitive system components.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It performs static analysis and visualization of dependency graphs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically scans Python files for import statements using AST parsing, mapping modules to files, then builds a dependency graph with NetworkX. It provides various visualization options, both static and interactive, using Matplotlib and Plotly. All operations involve file I/O and graph processing without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and no external system commands are invoked.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a dependency analysis tool with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static analysis and visualization of Python module dependencies. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security threats are present.",
