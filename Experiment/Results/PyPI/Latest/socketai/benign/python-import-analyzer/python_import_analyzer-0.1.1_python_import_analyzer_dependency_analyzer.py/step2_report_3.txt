  "review": "Let's evaluate each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It performs static analysis of Python source files in a directory.\n- Extracts import statements via AST parsing.\n- Maps modules to files, including handling package structures.\n- Builds a dependency graph with NetworkX.\n- Provides static and interactive visualizations (Matplotlib and Plotly).\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes static analysis and visualization.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No malicious sinks; standard file reading and plotting.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No network or external data leakage; only visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious behavior; the code is a dependency visualization tool.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. The small securityRisk score (0.1) is justified by the fact that the code reads files and processes project structure, which could be misused if supplied malicious files, but as-is, it's safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No network or system modifications; only static analysis and visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as a safe dependency analysis utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external communication; only file I/O and visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a dependency visualization tool with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Standard file parsing and visualization; no network or external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Justified. The small securityRisk score reflects that the code reads project files, which could be misused if malicious files are present, but as-is, it's safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (~0.1) in some reports, justified by file I/O operations, but no active threat.\n- **Confidence:** High (1), given the static, non-malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n\n- The code is a standard dependency analysis and visualization tool.\n- No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The small security risk score (~0.1) is reasonable, considering potential misuse if malicious files are supplied, but the code itself is safe.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation remains at 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** (slightly above zero, justified) | **1** |\n\nThe slight security risk score reflects that the code reads files and could be misused if malicious files are supplied, but it is not malicious itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
