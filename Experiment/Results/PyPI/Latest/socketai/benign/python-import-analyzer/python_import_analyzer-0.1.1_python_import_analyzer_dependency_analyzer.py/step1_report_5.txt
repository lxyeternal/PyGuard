{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze and visualize dependencies among Python files within a directory, constructing dependency graphs and providing interactive visualizations.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (`open` in `extract_imports`), user input points (file paths and directory paths), module import statements, and potential dynamically generated data for visualization.",
  "sinks": "File parsing results, graph construction, and visualization functions which process and display dependency data.",
  "flows": "File paths are read and parsed to extract import statements (source), which are then mapped to files (intermediate step). The dependency graph is built from this data (flow), and visualization functions render the dependency graph (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code does perform file I/O and visualization but these are standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically extracts import dependencies from Python files, maps modules to file paths, and constructs a directed graph representing dependencies. It offers both static and interactive visualizations using matplotlib and Plotly. No suspicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The only potential concern might be that visualization functions process potentially sensitive project structure data, but this is standard for dependency analysis tools. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a dependency analysis and visualization tool for Python projects. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply reads project files, constructs dependency graphs, and visualizes them. There are no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage within this module.",
