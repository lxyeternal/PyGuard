{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python project dependencies by extracting import statements, mapping modules to files, building dependency graphs, and visualizing these dependencies interactively or statically.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files from a directory, parses their AST for import statements, and loads file contents for parsing.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or execute untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "flows": "File reading -> AST parsing -> import extraction -> module-to-file mapping -> dependency graph construction -> visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of visualization libraries is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python modules for AST parsing, filesystem traversal, and graph visualization. It extracts import statements from source files and maps them to modules and files, constructing a dependency graph. Visualization functions provide static and interactive dependency diagrams. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a dependency analysis tool without malicious intent or malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a dependency analysis and visualization tool for Python projects, utilizing standard libraries and techniques. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the static analysis of its content.",
