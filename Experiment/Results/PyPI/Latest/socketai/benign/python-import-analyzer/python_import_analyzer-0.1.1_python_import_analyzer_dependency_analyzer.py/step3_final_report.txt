  "purpose": "Static analysis and visualization of Python module dependencies within a project directory.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files, extracts import statements via AST parsing.",
  "sinks": "Visualization libraries (matplotlib, plotly); no malicious sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "File reading -> AST parsing -> dependency graph construction -> visualization.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis by parsing Python files to extract import statements, maps modules to files, constructs a dependency graph, and visualizes it both statically and interactively. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code relies solely on file I/O and visualization, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are justified by the minimal risk associated with file handling, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency analysis and visualization tool with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as assigned.",
