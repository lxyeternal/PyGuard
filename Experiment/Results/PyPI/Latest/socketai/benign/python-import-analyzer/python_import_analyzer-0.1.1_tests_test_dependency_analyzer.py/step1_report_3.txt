{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of unit tests for various functions in a dependency analysis module for Python projects, including file discovery, import extraction, dependency graph building, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input files from the temporary test project directory, especially Python source files created during tests, and parses them using the AST module.",
  "sinks": "Uses visualization functions and plotting libraries (matplotlib and plotly), but these are standard and controlled within tests; no data leaks or harmful effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Extracts imports from source files, constructs dependency graphs, and visualizes graphs, with data flows confined within the test environment. No untrusted or external data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly performs testing of dependency analysis functions, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite for dependency analysis and visualization functions. It creates temporary files and directories, simulates dependency structures, and verifies correct behavior. No code shows signs of malicious intent, external data exfiltration, or sabotage. Use of standard libraries and controlled test data indicates a low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate testing suite for a dependency analysis tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely within a controlled test environment to validate functionality.",
