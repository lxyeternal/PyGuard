{
  "purpose": "This code provides test cases for a Python dependency analysis module, verifying functionalities such as import extraction, dependency graph building, visualization, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads from Python files created in temporary directories, imports from standard libraries (os, ast, shutil, tempfile, pytest, networkx, plotly), and uses internal dependency analyzer functions.",
  "sinks": "Does not perform or contain any data output or network communication, and does not execute untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Uses AST parsing to analyze import statements, builds dependency graphs, visualizes graphs, and performs tests to verify functionality—all within controlled testing environments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code strictly adheres to testing practices for dependency analysis with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive set of unit tests for a dependency analyzer module, using standard testing libraries and techniques. It creates temporary project structures, verifies import extraction, dependency graph construction, and visualization functions. All operations are confined to test setups, with no external network access, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious code patterns. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security-related vulnerabilities. It strictly tests the functionality of the dependency analysis and visualization tools, with appropriate error handling and mock patching for plotting functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured test suite for a dependency analysis library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. It only performs standard testing activities, utilizing common libraries and techniques. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
