{
  "purpose": "This code provides a test suite for the dependency analyzer module, verifying its functions related to parsing Python files, building dependency graphs, and visualizing them.",
  "sources": "Reads Python files from temporary directories, parses Python source code using AST, and reads input files to generate dependency graphs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data directly; visualization functions generate plots, but do not perform harmful actions. No network or system calls are made with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads source code files -> Extracts import statements -> Builds dependency graphs -> Visualizes graphs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code strictly appears to be test code for dependency analysis, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite for a dependency analysis module, focusing on verifying correctness of import extraction, dependency graph construction, visualization, and error handling. All functions are related to testing the behavior of a dependency analyzer and visualization tools, with no code indicating malicious intent. No external network or system manipulation occurs, and the code uses standard testing practices. The initial import statements include libraries used for testing and graph visualization, not for malicious activities. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The test cases generate temporary files and directories, analyze import statements, and verify graph building, all within a controlled testing environment. The code's purpose is diagnostic and validation of a dependency analysis library, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate test suite for a dependency analyzer library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical testing tasks and does not include any harmful or suspicious actions.",
