{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a comprehensive test suite for a dependency analysis library, verifying import extraction, dependency graph construction, and visualization functionalities within a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "File reads for Python scripts (main.py, util.py, helper.py, unused.py, submodule files), import statements within these files, and test functions creating and parsing code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; operations are confined to file I/O, AST parsing, and visualization functions that do not involve network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Import statements are parsed from files (sources) and used to build dependency graphs; visualization functions process graph data for display, with no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present; code structure is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of unit tests for dependency analysis functions, creating temporary files, parsing imports, building dependency graphs, and visualizing them. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The tests include error handling and cover various visualization modes, all within a safe, controlled environment. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for dependency analysis tools with no security risks, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
