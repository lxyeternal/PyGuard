{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for a Python dependency analysis tool, including functions for extracting imports, building dependency graphs, and visualizing dependencies.",
  "sources": "Test data generation in 'test_project' fixture creating various Python files, and test functions reading files and analyzing their content.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains explicit sinks such as network communications, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to data leakage or system harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (extract_imports, file content) through dependency graph construction and visualization functions; no untrusted data is directed to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. All code uses standard libraries and well-understood testing patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases for a dependency analyzer module. It generates temporary files with typical import statements, verifies import extraction, dependency graph creation, and visualization. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The code uses standard Python libraries, mocks visualization functions to avoid side effects, and does not include any network or system modification commands. All operations are confined to testing environments and file manipulations without dangerous actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for dependency analysis and visualization functions. It performs typical file creation, parsing, and graph visualization tests without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
