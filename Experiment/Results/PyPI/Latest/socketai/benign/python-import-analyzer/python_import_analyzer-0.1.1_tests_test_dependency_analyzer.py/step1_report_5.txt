{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for a dependency analysis tool that examines Python project files for dependencies and visualizations.",
  "sources": "Reads project files from temporary directories, including Python files, and parses AST nodes for import statements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems, executes untrusted data, or performs network operations. It mainly reads files and creates plots.",
  "flows": "Reads files (sources) and processes ASTs for imports, builds dependency graphs, and visualizes data without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are detected. The code is standard test code for visualization and analysis functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test cases for dependency analysis functions, creating mock project structures, verifying import extraction, dependency graph building, and visualization. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are present. It focuses on testing the functionality of a dependency analyzer with mock data and does not perform any network or system modification activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for a dependency analysis tool, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It strictly tests functionality without executing untrusted code or performing harmful actions.",
