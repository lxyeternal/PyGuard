{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web-based Python dependency analyzer dashboard that visualizes import dependencies, allows filtering, and provides data export features.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user-provided project directory, entry point, and module base; reads data from stored graph data; reads callback triggers and user interactions.",
  "sinks": "Uses user input to generate dependency graphs; outputs to Cytoscape visualization; provides CSV download functionality; updates UI elements based on interactions.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger dependency graph building; data flows from user inputs to graph construction, filtering, visualization updates, and data table generation; data flows from stored data to CSV download.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard library and open-source packages securely; no obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system modifications detected. The only file I/O is reading the project directory and file paths, which is expected for a dependency analysis tool.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, well-formed implementation of a dashboard application using Dash, Cytoscape, and NetworkX. It loads modules, constructs dependency graphs from user-specified directories, filters nodes based on various criteria, and visualizes the dependencies with interactive features. The code only reads user input, processes dependency data, and provides data export options. It does not include any network communication, system modifications, or malicious behaviors. All operations are confined to visualization and data handling within the app. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source dependency visualization dashboard with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It functions as intended for dependency analysis without including harmful or covert operations.",
