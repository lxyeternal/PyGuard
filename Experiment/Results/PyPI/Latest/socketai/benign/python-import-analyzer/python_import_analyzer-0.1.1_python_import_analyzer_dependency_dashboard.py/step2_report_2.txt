  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose as a dependency visualization dashboard, with data flow confined to user inputs, graph building, filtering, visualization, and CSV export. No external network activity or code execution is observed.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. Error logs via `print` are typical and not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as a legitimate, safe tool. The malware score of 0 aligns with this.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The report's assessment seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar accurate description, emphasizing standard data flow within the app. No network or external malicious activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard open-source packages securely.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Valid assessment; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code's operation. No external communication or malicious data flow.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code. Uses standard packages and patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; the code is a standard dependency visualization app with no network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation. Filesystem access is limited to reading project files, typical for such tools.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment, confirming safety.\n\n**Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; the code reads user inputs and builds dependency graphs without executing untrusted code or establishing network connections.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. External resources are benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is benign.\n\n**Score suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, which is appropriate given the code's operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly higher than zero due to filesystem access and dependency analysis, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a safe, standard open-source dependency visualization tool with no security risks or malicious intent.",
