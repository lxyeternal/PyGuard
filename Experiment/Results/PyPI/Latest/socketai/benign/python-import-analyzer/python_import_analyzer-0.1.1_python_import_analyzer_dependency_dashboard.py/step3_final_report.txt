{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python dependency visualization dashboard using Dash and Cytoscape.js, allowing users to analyze project dependencies, filter nodes, and export data.",
  "sources": "User inputs for project directory, entry point, module base, filter keywords, connection range, and node selection; dependency graph data stored in 'graph-data'.",
  "sinks": "Data processing within the app; visualization updates; CSV download; no external network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger graph building and filtering; data flows from 'graph-data' store to visualization and table components; interactions update node selection and layout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and practices; error logs via 'print' are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured dependency visualization tool with filtering, layout options, and CSV export. It reads user inputs, builds dependency graphs with 'build_dependency_graph', filters nodes based on connection counts and keywords, and visualizes them with Cytoscape. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Error handling is via standard 'print' statements. The code does not perform any malicious actions or secret handling. The only filesystem access is reading project files, typical for such tools. The logic is straightforward, and the code is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, open-source dependency visualization dashboard with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to filesystem access which is expected for dependency analysis tools.",
