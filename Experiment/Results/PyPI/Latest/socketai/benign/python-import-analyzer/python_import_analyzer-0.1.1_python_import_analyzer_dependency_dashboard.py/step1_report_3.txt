{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web-based dependency analysis tool for Python projects, visualizing import dependencies, and providing data export capabilities.",
  "sources": "User inputs for project directory, entry point, module base; callback triggers; external libraries (os, networkx, dash, dash_cytoscape, pandas); build_dependency_graph function call.",
  "sinks": "Data flow occurs within callback functions updating the Cytoscape graph, node table, and CSV download; no evidence of data being sent over the network or external storage.",
  "flows": "Input from user triggers graph building, filtering, and visualization; data is processed within callbacks and rendered; no external or suspicious data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of explicit file paths and external assets; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or uncommon language features; no dynamic code execution or eval; no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a web dashboard for visualizing and analyzing Python project dependencies using standard libraries and open-source packages. It reads user input for project paths and filters, builds dependency graphs, and visualizes them with Cytoscape. The data processing and visualization logic are straightforward. No malicious code such as network connections, data theft, reverse shells, or sabotage behaviors are present. The use of standard library functions and packages, along with well-defined data handling, indicates no malicious intent. The code adheres to typical application patterns without obfuscation or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate visualization tool for dependency analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior. It performs typical operations for a dashboard application, including user input handling, graph construction, visualization, and data export, all within a standard and safe manner.",
