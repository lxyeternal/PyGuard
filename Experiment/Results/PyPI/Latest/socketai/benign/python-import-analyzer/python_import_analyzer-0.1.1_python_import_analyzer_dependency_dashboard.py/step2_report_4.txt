  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a dependency visualization dashboard that reads user inputs and dependency graph data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or system commands; data flows are confined within the app.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected. Uses standard libraries, and error logs are via `print`.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly states the code is safe, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2** seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the app's functionality and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, only internal data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior. Uses standard libraries; no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment. Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. **Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1** are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the app's operation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity; data remains within the app.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; standard usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or system commands; only internal data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct. Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly summarizes the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network activity; data is processed locally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; benign external resources.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscated or suspicious code. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code is straightforward and readable. **Obfuscated score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign low risk (0.1-0.2), which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Given the code's purpose and implementation, a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears safe, transparent, and free from malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- The code is a legitimate open-source dependency visualization tool with no security risks identified.",
