{
  "purpose": "This code implements a web-based dependency analyzer for Python projects, visualizing import relationships and providing interactive filtering, selection, and data export features.",
  "sources": "Reads project directory path, entry point file, module base, and user interactions such as button clicks, node selections, and filter inputs; loads dependencies via build_dependency_graph from an imported module.",
  "sinks": "Updates Cytoscape graph elements, node table, and CSV download; interacts with filesystem to build graph; no direct or indirect network connections or data exfiltration identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger dependency graph rebuild; filters and selections modify graph visualization; data is prepared and sent to frontend components for display or download; no external data flows or network activity are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no suspicious network calls, file modifications, or reverse shell activities. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading from filesystem and constructing dependency graph, which is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Dash application for visualizing Python package dependencies. It includes user inputs for project path, entry point, and filtering options. The dependency graph is generated using external functions (build_dependency_graph, find_required_files) and displayed via Cytoscape. Event handlers update visualization based on user actions, with safeguards against exceptions. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code avoids network activity, file manipulation beyond reading project files, and secret handling. Its purpose aligns with dependency analysis, with no suspicious or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency visualization tool without malicious behavior. It follows standard patterns for web apps and dependency analysis, with no indicators of malware or security risks. Its structure and operations are consistent with its stated purpose.",
