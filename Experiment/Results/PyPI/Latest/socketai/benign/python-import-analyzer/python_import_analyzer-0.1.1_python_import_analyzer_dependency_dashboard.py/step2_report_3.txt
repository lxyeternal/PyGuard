  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their claims with the provided code, and assess the scores, especially focusing on malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a dependency visualization dashboard that reads user inputs and dependency graph data. Correctly notes reliance on `build_dependency_graph`.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly states that data flows within the app are confined to visualization, filtering, and CSV export, with no external network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses `print` for error logs, which is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate, with a high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the app's purpose and data sources. No inaccuracies.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately notes data is processed internally, with no external communication.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's operations are typical for such dashboards.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscation scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound assessment, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly characterizes the code's purpose and data inputs.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes internal data handling, no external data flows.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities. Uses standard packages and approaches.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscation scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the app's functionality and data sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly states data flows are within the app, no network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment, high confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscation scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the code builds and visualizes dependency graphs, with user inputs.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes no network or system command execution.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. External resources are benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes the code is benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscation scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard visualization dashboard, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and has no hidden or complex dynamic code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk remains very low, around 0.1–0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity or code detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1** — Low risk, typical for a dependency visualization tool.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a legitimate, open-source dependency visualization dashboard with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and suitable for open-source use.",
