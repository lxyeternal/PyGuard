  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose—visualizing Python dependencies with filtering and export features. The sources, sinks, and data flows are correctly identified, focusing on user inputs, dependency graph data, and visualization updates.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed. The use of `print` for error logs is standard, not suspicious. The code does not perform network activity, system modifications, or code execution beyond visualization and data handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is safe and legitimate is justified, with a high confidence level (0.95). The malware score of 0 aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly states that the app visualizes dependencies, filters, and allows data export. No suspicious data flows or external communications are detected.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, code obfuscation, or secret handling. The code operates within standard parameters, reading user inputs, building graphs, and visualizing data.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes that the code is legitimate with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the functionality—dependency visualization, filtering, and export. Data flows are confined within the app, with no external network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns. Uses standard libraries and practices, with no obfuscation or secrets.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, with a malware score of 0 and high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly summarizes the app's role in dependency visualization, filtering, and data export, with data flows limited to within the application.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, network activity, or code injection observed. Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates the code as legitimate, with a malware score of 0 and high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the app's purpose and data flow, emphasizing safe handling of user inputs and benign external resources.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secret handling. External resources are benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is safe, with malware score 0 and high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1-0.2), mainly due to filesystem access based on user input, which is expected for a dependency analysis tool.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for such tools with filesystem access)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a legitimate, well-structured dependency visualization dashboard with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
