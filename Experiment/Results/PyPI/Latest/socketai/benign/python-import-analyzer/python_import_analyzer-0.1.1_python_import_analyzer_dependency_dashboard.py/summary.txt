  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, open-source dependency visualization dashboard with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to filesystem access which is expected for dependency analysis tools."
