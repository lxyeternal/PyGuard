  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional logic or data handling. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of a module within the same package. There are no visible sources of untrusted input, no data processing, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution. The import appears to be standard and benign, likely part of a larger package. No malicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any sensitive operations or suspicious activities.",
