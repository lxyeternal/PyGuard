  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, reasoning, and scores to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code snippet is: `from . import stock_quant_history_snapshot`\n- It is a simple relative import of a local module within the same package.\n- There are no data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The import is standard practice in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Import a module from the same package.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the import as benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, obfuscated 0.0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correctly states the import is benign.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable; malware and risk scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same reasoning, benign, standard import.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also benign.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Issue:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 suggests some minimal concern, but given the code is just an import, this seems unwarranted.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should be 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, except for report 5, which is slightly elevated to 0.1 despite no justification.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores Adjustment:** For report 5, reduce `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the other reports and the actual code context.\n- **Overall Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Overall Risk Score:** Should be 0 for all, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the unanimous findings of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a straightforward relative import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect this, with all malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0 as well.",
