  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement: `from . import stock_quant_history_snapshot`. This is a standard Python relative import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flaws. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same import statement, no additional logic.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No flaws identified; reasoning consistent.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; confidence is 0.9, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 is justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; confidence is 1.0.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same import statement, standard practice.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n   - **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; confidence is 1.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 is justified.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minor security risk score of 0.1, possibly reflecting minimal concern.\n   - **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, which is consistent.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 would be more accurate than 0.1, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** The security risk score should be 0.0, not 0.1, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign import statement.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, which is accurate.\n- The risk scores are generally 0, except for report 5, which should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- For report 5, adjust the securityRisk score from 0.1 to 0.0.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores across all reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk present)\n\nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
