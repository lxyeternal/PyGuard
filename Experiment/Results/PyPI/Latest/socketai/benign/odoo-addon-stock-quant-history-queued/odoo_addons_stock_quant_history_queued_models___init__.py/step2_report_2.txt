  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of the code in question:**\n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from . import stock_quant_history_snapshot\n   ```\n   This is a standard relative import of a local module within the same package.\n\n2. **Logical consistency and reasoning:**\n   - Each report correctly identifies that this is a straightforward import with no data processing, no external inputs, and no network activity.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are observed.\n   - The analyses are consistent and accurate given the minimal code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate for such a benign import statement.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), indicating the reviewers are certain about their benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential issues or claims:**\n   - No report suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The only minor point is in report 5, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this seems overly cautious. It might be better scored as 0, unless there's context outside this snippet.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk exists here.\n   - The reasoning is sound, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk from a simple import statement.\n\n**Final note:** The import statement alone cannot be malicious unless combined with malicious code elsewhere. Without additional context, this is a benign, standard Python package import.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate, with minor room for adjustment (e.g., report 5's securityRisk to 0).\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.",
