  "purpose": "Import a module named stock_quant_history_snapshot from the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement, which reads the local module stock_quant_history_snapshot",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement, no data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a standard relative import without any suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains a simple relative import statement, which is a common practice in Python packages to include local modules. There is no indication of data input, output, or malicious code execution. As this is only a single line of import, no complex flows or anomalies are present. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a local module, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues based on this snippet alone.",
