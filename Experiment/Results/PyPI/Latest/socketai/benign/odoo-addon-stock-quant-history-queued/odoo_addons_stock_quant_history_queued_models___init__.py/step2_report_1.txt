  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue Present?** No. The code is a simple import statement.\n   - **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies that this is a benign import.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0. These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue Present?** No. The import statement is standard.\n   - **Errors or Flaws?** None. The analysis correctly states that there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 confidence but zero risk is justified; the high confidence is acceptable given the context.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct. No adjustments necessary.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue Present?** No. Again, a straightforward import.\n   - **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. All appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue Present?** No. The import is benign.\n   - **Errors or Flaws?** None. The report correctly dismisses malicious intent.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. The confidence is high, which is reasonable.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue Present?** No. The import is standard.\n   - **Errors or Flaws?** Slightly more cautious with a risk score of 0.1, but since it's only an import, this is acceptable.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The confidence is 0.9, which aligns with the minimal risk.\n   - **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk exists based solely on these import statements.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — import statements alone pose no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The import statement is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
