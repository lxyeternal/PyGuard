  "purpose": "Import a local module within the same package",
  "sources": "Relative import statement: 'from . import stock_quant_history_snapshot'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; import statement does not process data",
  "flows": "N/A; import statement does not involve data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward relative import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a module within the same package. It does not include any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is standard in Python packages and poses no security risk. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minimal code and lack of external dependencies or data flows indicate a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. All scores should reflect this benign nature.",
