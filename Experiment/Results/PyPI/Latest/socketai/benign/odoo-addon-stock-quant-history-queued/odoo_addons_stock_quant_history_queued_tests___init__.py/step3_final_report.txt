{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the module 'test_stock_quant_history_queued' within the same package, likely for internal use or testing.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "The import loads the module into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond module loading occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement, common in Python packages. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The import does not involve data flows, network activity, or external inputs. The minimal nature of the code suggests benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the context. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The content and structure are standard and pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for Python packages and does not warrant concern. The scores and assessments are justified and consistent with the code snippet.",
