{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'test_stock_quant_history_queued' from the same package, likely for testing or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package/module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; no execution of external commands, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads a module; no data flows are apparent beyond the module import itself.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement with no additional context, which is not unusual but provides minimal insight.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module from the current package, which is standard in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. Since only a single import statement is present, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. No suspicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution are evident. The minimal code makes it impossible to identify malicious intent or malicious code flow beyond the import.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
