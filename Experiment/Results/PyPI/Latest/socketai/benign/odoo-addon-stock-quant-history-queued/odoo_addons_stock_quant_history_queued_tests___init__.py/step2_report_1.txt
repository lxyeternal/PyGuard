  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom . import test_stock_quant_history_queued\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n- **Is the reported import present?**  \n  Yes, all reports reference the same import statement, which matches the code snippet.\n\n- **Are there any issues such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code?**  \n  No. The code is a straightforward relative import, which is common in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports\n- **General observations:**  \n  All reports agree that this is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They correctly identify that no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n\n- **Potential flaw:**  \n  The reports assign a *security risk* score of approximately 0.1, indicating minimal concern. Given the simplicity of the code, this seems reasonable.\n\n- **Malware assessment:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Any assumptions?**  \n  The reports assume that since the code only imports a module, it cannot be malicious. This is generally valid unless the imported module itself is malicious, but that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Scores and Their Reasonableness\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The scores (~0.1) are appropriate for such benign import statements, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Correctly 0, since there's no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Additional Considerations\n- **Could the imported module be malicious?**  \n  While the import statement itself is benign, the security implications depend on the content of `test_stock_quant_history_queued`. If that module contains malicious code, the risk could be higher. However, based solely on this import statement, we cannot assess that.\n\n- **Is there any suspicious pattern?**  \n  No. The import is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Final Assessment\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (as assigned) is reasonable, considering this is a minimal import statement with no evident issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The primary concern would be the content of `test_stock_quant_history_queued`, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe import statement is benign, standard Python code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the context, 0.1 is acceptable for a minimal import)",
