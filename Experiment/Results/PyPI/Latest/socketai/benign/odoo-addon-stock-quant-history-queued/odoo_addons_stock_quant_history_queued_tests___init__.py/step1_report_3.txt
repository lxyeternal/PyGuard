  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of a module within the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. Since the code is limited to an import statement, it does not interact with untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute potentially harmful code directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of normal package structure, likely for testing or internal functionality.",
