  "purpose": "Extend the stock.quant.history.snapshot model in Odoo to add new states and enqueue a background job for generating stock quantity history.",
  "sources": "self, snapshot, snapshot.inventory_date.timestamp()",
  "sinks": "self.with_delay()._generate_stock_quant_history()",
  "flows": "action_generate_stock_quant_history calls _setup_queue_jobs_generate_stock_quant_history, which sets state to 'queued' and then schedules a delayed job to run _generate_stock_quant_history",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file operations, no obfuscation, and no unusual code patterns. Usage of with_delay suggests asynchronous background processing, which is standard in Odoo but worth noting.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies a model to add new states and provides methods to enqueue background jobs for data processing. It uses Odoo's queue system (with_delay) properly to schedule asynchronous tasks. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard extension of Odoo models for background processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Odoo model extension with background job scheduling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward, and all code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to stock quant history management.",
