{
  "purpose": "This code extends an Odoo model to add new states to a stock quant history snapshot and schedules background jobs for generating stock history.",
  "sources": "Reading class definitions, field declarations, and method calls within the class.",
  "sinks": "Method call self.with_delay() which schedules an asynchronous job.",
  "flows": "User or system triggers action_generate_stock_quant_history, which sets the state to 'queued' and then calls _generate_stock_quant_history asynchronously via with_delay().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or hidden backdoors. Use of with_delay() for asynchronous processing is standard in Odoo workflows. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a model extension that adds new selection options to an existing model field and provides methods to queue a background job for stock history generation. The use of self.with_delay() indicates scheduled task execution, which is a common pattern in Odoo for deferred processing. No external data sources, network communications, or data leaks are present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on workflow management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical extension for managing stock history snapshots in Odoo, utilizing standard background job scheduling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and legitimate.",
