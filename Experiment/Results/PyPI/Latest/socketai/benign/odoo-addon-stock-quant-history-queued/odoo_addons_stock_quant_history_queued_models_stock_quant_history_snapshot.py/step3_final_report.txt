{
  "purpose": "Extend the stock.quant.history.snapshot model by adding 'queued' and 'generated' states, and provide methods to enqueue background processing jobs for stock quant history generation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'inventory_date' for job priority, accesses 'state' field, and calls 'with_delay()' to schedule '_generate_stock_quant_history()'.",
  "sinks": "The scheduled '_generate_stock_quant_history()' runs asynchronously; no external data or untrusted input directly flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Method 'action_generate_stock_quant_history()' triggers '_setup_queue_jobs_generate_stock_quant_history()', which sets 'state' to 'queued' and enqueues '_generate_stock_quant_history()' with priority based on 'inventory_date.timestamp()'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected. Use of 'with_delay()' is standard for background jobs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of an Odoo model, adding states and scheduling background jobs via 'with_delay()'. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The background task scheduling is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The implementation appears safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for managing stock quant history snapshots with background processing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores and confidence levels in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
