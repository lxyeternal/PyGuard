  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'models' from the same package. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs. The import appears to be standard Python module import syntax without any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. The snippet is too minimal to indicate any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign and is likely part of a larger application.",
