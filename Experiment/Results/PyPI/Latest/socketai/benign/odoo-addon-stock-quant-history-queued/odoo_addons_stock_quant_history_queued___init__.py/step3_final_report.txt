{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the 'models' module, typical in Python package structures.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external data or input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, 'from . import models'. It involves no data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with this analysis. The high confidence score (close to 1) reflects certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
