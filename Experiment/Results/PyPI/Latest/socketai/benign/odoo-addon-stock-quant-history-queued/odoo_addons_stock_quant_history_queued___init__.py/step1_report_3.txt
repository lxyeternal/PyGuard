  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, bringing in 'models' from the current package. It does not process input, generate output, or perform any operations that could be malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Since it's only an import statement, there is no risk of malware or security issues based on this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
