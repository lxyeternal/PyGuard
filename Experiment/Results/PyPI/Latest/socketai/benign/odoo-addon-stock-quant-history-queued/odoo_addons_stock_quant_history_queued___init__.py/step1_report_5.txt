  "purpose": "Import modules from the current package, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'models' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data output or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and typical of package imports; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing 'models' from the current package. It is a standard Python practice to organize code into modules and packages. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. Due to the minimal nature of the code, no malicious intent or security risks are observable. The snippet alone cannot perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious or security concerns. It is a standard part of Python package/module structure.",
