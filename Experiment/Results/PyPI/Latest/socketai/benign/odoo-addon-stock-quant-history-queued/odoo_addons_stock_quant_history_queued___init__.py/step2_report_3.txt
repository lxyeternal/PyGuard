  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal import statement: `from . import models` or similar.\n- The analyses consistently conclude that these are benign, standard import statements with no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which makes sense given the simplicity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate for such benign code snippets.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code in question is simply importing a local module named `models`.\n- No data flows, external communications, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports assign a small security risk (0.1) in some cases, despite the code being harmless. While this is conservative, it could be justified if the context is unknown, but given the minimal code, it might be slightly overstated.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is reasonable.\n\n**Suggestions for score adjustments:**\n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no suspicious elements, the security risk score could be uniformly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The malware score remains correctly at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores given are reasonable but could be slightly adjusted for consistency:\n  - Set `securityRisk` to 0 for all reports.\n  - Keep `malware` at 0.\n  - Maintain high confidence.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from this code snippet)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are mostly appropriate, but for consistency, the minimal nature of the code suggests the security risk should be zero rather than 0.1 in some cases. The malware score remains at zero, as expected.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Confirm that the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- Adjust `securityRisk` to 0 across all reports.\n- Maintain `malware` at 0.\n- Keep `obfuscated` at 0.\n\nThis analysis supports that this code snippet poses no security threat.",
