  "purpose": "Monitor a directory for new screenshot files and rename them when detected.",
  "sources": "get_screenshot_directory() function call to obtain the screenshot directory; event.src_path when a new file is created.",
  "sinks": "rename_screenshot(filename) which potentially modifies or processes the detected screenshot files.",
  "flows": "Code detects new .png files with '.Screenshot' in their path, then calls rename_screenshot with the modified filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns are present. The code relies on external functions, which are not detailed here.",
  "analysis": "The code uses watchdog to monitor a specific directory for new files. When a new PNG file containing '.Screenshot' in its path is created, it replaces the substring and calls rename_screenshot. No user input, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The renaming process appears to be a benign file operation. The code structure and functions are standard, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. External functions such as get_screenshot_directory and rename_screenshot are assumed to be safe based on their naming and usage context.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs benign directory monitoring and file renaming related to screenshots. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected within this code fragment.",
