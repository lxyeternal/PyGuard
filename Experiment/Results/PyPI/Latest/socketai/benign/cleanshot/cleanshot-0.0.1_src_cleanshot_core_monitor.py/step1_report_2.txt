  "purpose": "Monitor a directory for new screenshot files and rename them accordingly.",
  "sources": "get_screenshot_directory() function call; event.src_path when a file is created.",
  "sinks": "rename_screenshot(filename) function call; print statements.",
  "flows": "Directory monitoring triggers on_created, which processes event.src_path and passes it to rename_screenshot.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes watchdog to monitor a specific screenshot directory. On detecting new PNG files with a particular naming pattern, it renames the file by replacing a substring and calls an external function to rename the screenshot. The code appears to be straightforward, mainly performing file system monitoring and renaming operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of print statements for logging is standard. No external network activity or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard directory monitor for renaming screenshot files with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a utility application with benign behavior.",
