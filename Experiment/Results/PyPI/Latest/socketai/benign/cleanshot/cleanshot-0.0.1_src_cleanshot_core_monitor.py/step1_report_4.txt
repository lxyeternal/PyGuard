  "purpose": "Monitor a specific directory for new PNG screenshot files and rename them accordingly.",
  "sources": "get_screenshot_directory() function call, event.src_path in on_created method",
  "sinks": "rename_screenshot() function call with filename derived from event.src_path",
  "flows": "get_screenshot_directory() -> on_created -> rename_screenshot()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, straightforward event handling",
  "analysis": "The code uses watchdog to monitor a directory for new PNG screenshot files with a specific naming pattern. It processes creation events, renames files, and calls an external function for further processing. No untrusted input is directly executed or transmitted. The functions used appear to be standard for filesystem monitoring. The only external dependency is get_screenshot_directory() which is presumably a utility function; no suspicious behavior observed. The code structure is clear and functional, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filesystem monitor designed to detect and rename screenshot files. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a legitimate utility script without security risks.",
