  "purpose": "Monitor a directory for new screenshot files with '.Screenshot' in their filename, then rename them and process further.",
  "sources": "get_screenshot_directory() for directory path; event.src_path for new file detection",
  "sinks": "rename_screenshot() function; print statements for notifications",
  "flows": "get_screenshot_directory() provides directory -> filesystem event triggers on creation -> filtering by filename -> rename_screenshot() called with modified filename",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity; external functions assumed safe; no exception handling present",
  "analysis": "The code implements a benign directory watcher that filters for PNG files with a specific pattern, then renames them. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are detected. External functions are presumed safe based on their naming and context. The lack of exception handling is noted but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for monitoring and renaming screenshot files. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
