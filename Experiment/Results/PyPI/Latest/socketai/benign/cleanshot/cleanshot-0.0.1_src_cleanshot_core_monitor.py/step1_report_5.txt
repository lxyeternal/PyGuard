  "purpose": "Monitor a directory for new PNG screenshot files and rename them accordingly.",
  "sources": "get_screenshot_directory() from cleanshot.utils, event.src_path in on_created method",
  "sinks": "rename_screenshot() function, print statements",
  "flows": "get_screenshot_directory() -> on_created event detection -> rename_screenshot()",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for status updates, no handling of potential exceptions in event handling, no validation of filename content beyond extension and substring",
  "analysis": "The code uses watchdog to monitor a directory for new PNG files containing '.Screenshot' in their path. Upon detection, it renames the file using an imported function. The code does not handle exceptions, nor does it process or transmit data over the network. It relies on external functions like get_screenshot_directory() and rename_screenshot(), which are not shown, but their usage appears standard. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain connections, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The logic is straightforward for a screenshot manager utility. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate screenshot monitoring utility with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply watches a directory and renames files as designed. It does not perform any data exfiltration, network communication, or suspicious actions.",
