  "purpose": "Load configuration settings from a .env file located in the user's home directory, specifically for LLM provider and API keys.",
  "sources": "Reading from a dotenv configuration file at Path.home() / CONFIG_FILE_NAME",
  "sinks": "Accessing environment variables stored in the dotenv file; no direct data leaks or system effects observed",
  "flows": "Reading configuration file path -> Parsing environment variables -> Providing accessors for configuration values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; straightforward use of dotenv library",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class that constructs the path to a configuration file in the user's home directory and loads its key-value pairs using dotenv_values. Accessor properties retrieve specific configuration values like API keys and provider info. The implementation appears standard, with no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior. Usage of dotenv is typical for configuration management, and there are no signs of malicious code or data exfiltration. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not involve any network connections or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads environment variables from a file and provides accessors. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
