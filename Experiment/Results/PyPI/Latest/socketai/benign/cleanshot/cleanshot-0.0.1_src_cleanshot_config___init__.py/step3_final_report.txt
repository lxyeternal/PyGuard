  "purpose": "Load configuration values from a dotenv file located in the user's home directory, providing access to specific environment variables such as API keys and provider info.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables from a dotenv configuration file via dotenv_values()",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code only reads local configuration data",
  "flows": "Source: dotenv file in home directory -> dotenv_values() -> property methods accessing environment variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class that constructs a path to a dotenv file in the user's home directory, loads environment variables using dotenv_values, and provides property accessors for specific keys. It is a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The only potential concern is the security of the dotenv file itself, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration loader with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low security risk reflects typical configuration handling. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
