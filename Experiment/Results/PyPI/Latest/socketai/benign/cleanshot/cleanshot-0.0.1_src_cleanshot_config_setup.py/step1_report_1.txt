  "purpose": "The code is designed to prompt users with setup questions for configuring an application, then save their answers into a configuration file.",
  "sources": "dotenv.dotenv_values reading from a file, user input via questionary prompts",
  "sinks": "Writing to a configuration file at the user's home directory",
  "flows": "dotenv.dotenv_values -> prompt_question (user input) -> answers update -> file write to config_path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries and straightforward user prompts. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads existing configuration values from a file, prompts the user for input using the questionary library, updates the answers, and then rewrites the configuration file. The data flow involves reading from a file and user input, then writing back to the same file. The code uses well-known libraries with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. There are no suspicious network calls, system modifications, or secret harvesting mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup utility for configuring application parameters. It operates solely through user prompts and file operations, with no malicious intent detected. Overall, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
