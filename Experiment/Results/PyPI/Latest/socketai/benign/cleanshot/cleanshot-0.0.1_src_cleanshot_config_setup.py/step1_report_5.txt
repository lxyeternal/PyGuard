  "purpose": "The code is designed to prompt users with setup questions, gather responses, and write them to a configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads existing environment variables from a configuration file at the user's home directory using dotenv.dotenv_values.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated environment variables to the same configuration file located in the user's home directory.",
  "flows": "Reads data from dotenv.dotenv_values (source) and writes user responses to the file with open() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of questionary for user prompts is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports configuration constants and types, prompts the user with questions via questionary, updates answers, and writes them back to a config file in the user's home directory. The flow of data is straightforward: environment variables are loaded, updated through user input, and saved. No untrusted external data sources or dangerous data handling methods are identified. No malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations are evident. The file writing is simple and controlled, and the code's purpose aligns with typical setup processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup utility that interacts with user input and manages environment variables securely. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
