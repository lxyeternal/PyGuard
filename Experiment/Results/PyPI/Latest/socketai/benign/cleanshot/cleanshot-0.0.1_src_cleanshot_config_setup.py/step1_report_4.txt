  "purpose": "This code is designed to prompt users with setup questions, collect their responses, and save the answers as environment variables in a configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads existing environment variables from a configuration file at Path.home() / CONFIG_FILE_NAME using dotenv.dotenv_values.",
  "sinks": "Writes the collected answers back to the configuration file at the same path, overwriting existing content.",
  "flows": "Loads existing environment variables (source) -> prompts user for input (potential source of untrusted data) -> updates answers -> writes answers to config file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of questionary for interactive prompts; no hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration points. The code properly handles user input and file I/O. No dynamic code execution or eval statements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads existing environment variables from a config file, prompts the user to provide or confirm configuration data via interactive questions, and then writes the new configuration back to the same file. The flow involves loading data, user interaction, and file writing, with no evident malicious behavior. All operations are standard for configuration setup, and third-party libraries used are common and benign. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic appears straightforward and aimed at configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as an interactive setup utility, safely handling user input and file operations. The risk score is very low, and the code appears secure for its intended purpose.",
