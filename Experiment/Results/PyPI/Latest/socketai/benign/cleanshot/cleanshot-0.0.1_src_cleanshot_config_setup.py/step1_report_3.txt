  "purpose": "This code provides an interactive setup for configuration, prompting the user to select options for LLM provider and other settings, and then writes the answers to a dotenv configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reads existing environment variables from a dotenv file at the user's home directory; receives user input through questionary prompts.",
  "sinks": "Writes user-provided answers to a configuration file located at the user's home directory.",
  "flows": "Reads existing environment variables -> Prompts user for input -> Updates answers -> Writes updated answers back to dotenv file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no code for malicious data exfiltration, system manipulation, or suspicious network activity; use of user input appears limited to configuration prompts. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads existing environment variables from a user's home directory dotenv file, prompts the user for configuration options via questionary (which are stored in a dictionary), then writes the updated configuration back to the same dotenv file. The data flow is straightforward: source (dotenv values) -> user input -> sink (file write). There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All inputs are used for configuration purposes only. No suspicious or anomalous code constructs or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard interactive configuration process, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It reads and writes environment variables securely, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
