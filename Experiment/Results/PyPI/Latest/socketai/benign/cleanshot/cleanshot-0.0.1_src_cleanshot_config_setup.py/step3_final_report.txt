  "purpose": "A setup utility that reads existing environment variables from a dotenv file, prompts the user for configuration options via questionary, and writes the answers back to the same dotenv configuration file.",
  "sources": "dotenv.dotenv_values reading from the config file, questionary prompts for user input, file open/write for saving configuration",
  "sinks": "Writing updated environment variables back to the configuration file",
  "flows": "dotenv_values -> user prompts -> answers dictionary -> file write",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management: it loads existing environment variables, interactively prompts the user for input, updates the answers, and rewrites the dotenv file. It uses well-known libraries without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution is present. The data flow is straightforward, with no suspicious data leaks or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
