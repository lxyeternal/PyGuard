  "purpose": "The code exports the ScreenshotMonitorApp class for external use, likely as part of a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ScreenshotMonitorApp from a local module named menu.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are evident within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs. The presence of a class import suggests normal modular design.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for export. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage observed. The code appears to be a straightforward module export statement. Due to its simplicity, there are no apparent anomalies or security issues. No external data or untrusted input is processed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to expose the ScreenshotMonitorApp class for use elsewhere, with no malicious intent detected.",
