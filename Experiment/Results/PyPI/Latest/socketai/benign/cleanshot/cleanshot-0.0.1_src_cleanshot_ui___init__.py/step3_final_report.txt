  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and exports a class without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for module exports",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export statement with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or network activity. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
