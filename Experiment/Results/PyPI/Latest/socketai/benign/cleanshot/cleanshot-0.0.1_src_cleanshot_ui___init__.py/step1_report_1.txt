  "purpose": "This code exports the ScreenshotMonitorApp class from the menu module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ScreenshotMonitorApp from a local module; no other data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Import source leads to the __all__ list, which specifies the public API of the module.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module export list for a class imported from a local module. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or data processing. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages that define public APIs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
