  "purpose": "Module interface that imports and re-exports specific components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sibling modules (.monitor and .rename).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from sibling modules → export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components and exposes them via __all__, serving as a simple interface module. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The structure is typical for such modules, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a module interface, and the scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
  "confidence": 1,
