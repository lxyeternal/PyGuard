  "sources": "Import statements for monitor and rename modules, and the __all__ list defining exports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; the code only imports and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs; very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes or functions from sibling modules and defines its export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. No suspicious functions, no dynamic execution, no network calls, and no embedded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as an import/export aggregator for module components. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
