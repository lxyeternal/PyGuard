  "purpose": "Export module interfaces for ScreenshotManager and rename_screenshot functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .monitor and .rename",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, then exposes them via __all__. There are no runtime data inputs, no external data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of defining API exports without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module simply exports components from other modules without any suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
