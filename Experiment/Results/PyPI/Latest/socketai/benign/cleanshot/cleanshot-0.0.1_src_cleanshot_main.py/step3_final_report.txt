  "sinks": "Application startup via app.run(), environment variables loaded into process environment.",
  "flows": "Config file existence check -> command-line args parsing -> run_setup() if needed -> dotenv.load_dotenv() -> app initialization and run.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, setup handling, and application startup. No malicious behavior, network activity, or security flaws are evident. The use of dotenv and command-line args is typical. The functions invoked are assumed benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The control flow is straightforward and aligns with typical application bootstrap scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign startup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
