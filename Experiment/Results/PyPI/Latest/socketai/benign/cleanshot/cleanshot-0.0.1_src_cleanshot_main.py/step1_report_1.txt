  "purpose": "To initialize and run a screenshot monitoring application, with optional setup procedures.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), Path.home() / CONFIG_FILE_NAME (config file path), dotenv.load_dotenv (loading environment variables)",
  "sinks": "dotenv.load_dotenv (potentially loading secrets), run_setup() (potential configuration modification), app.run() (execution of app logic)",
  "flows": "Command-line args → conditional setup logic → loading environment variables from config → running setup or main app",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network connections or data leaks; straightforward flow; dotenv.load_dotenv used properly for environment configuration",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration from a file located in the user's home directory, runs setup if needed, and then launches a screenshot monitoring application. The dotenv library is used to load environment variables from the config file. The control flow is straightforward with conditional setup logic based on command-line arguments. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities or malicious code patterns are evident. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is benign, focused on application startup and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard application bootstrap script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs setup and application startup tasks securely and predictably.",
