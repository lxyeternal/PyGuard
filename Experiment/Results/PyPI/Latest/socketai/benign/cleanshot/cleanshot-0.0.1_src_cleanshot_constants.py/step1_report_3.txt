{
  "purpose": "Defines a class and constants related to OpenAI API configuration and a prompt template for image analysis.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, class attribute, and a multi-line string containing a prompt.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only contains static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (except for a possible typo in 'gpt-4o-mini'), or obfuscated code. The model name 'gpt-4o-mini' may be a typo, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a single attribute indicating a provider, several constants for API URL and configuration filename, and a prompt template string for an image analysis AI. The prompt is a static string with no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external network communication. There are no signs of malicious intent such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the model name 'gpt-4o-mini', which appears to be a typo or misconfiguration, but not malicious. Overall, this code is straightforward, static, and intended for configuration and prompt generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for configuration and prompt template purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The only minor concern is a possible typo in a model name, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
