  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports describe static class definitions, constants, and prompt templates.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, network calls, or external data processing are present.\n   - The code is purely configuration for an AI image analysis prompt, with no executable logic beyond static string assignments.\n   - The URL points to the OpenAI API endpoint, which is standard and not malicious.\n   - The only minor issue noted is a potential typo in the model name 'gpt-4o-mini', but this is likely a typo, not malicious.\n\n2. **Malware and Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets (apart from a possibly misspelled model name), no network activity, no data leaks.\n   - The code is static configuration, with no evident security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Logic and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and configuration-focused.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n\n5. **Score Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The security risk score is 0, justified given the static, benign nature.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies**:\n   - The only point to consider is the model name 'gpt-4o-mini'. If this is a typo, it might be a configuration mistake but not malicious. It does not impact security or malware assessment.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a static configuration and prompt template for an AI image analysis assistant.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- The only minor concern is a typo in the model name, which is a configuration issue, not a security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Keep the scores as they are.\n- Possibly correct the typo in the model name for clarity, but this does not impact security assessment.\n\n**Estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
