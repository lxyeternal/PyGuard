{
  "purpose": "Defines a class and constants for an AI provider and configuration parameters, including a prompt template for an image analysis assistant.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, class attribute assignment, and a multi-line string (PROMPT).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The PROMPT string is static; no dynamic input handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be configuration/setup for a prompt template.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with a single attribute and sets up several constants, including a URL, a filename, and a detailed prompt string. There are no functions, no input/output handling, no network calls, or other dynamic operations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The prompt text is static and describes a task for an AI model; it does not include executable code that could be malicious. The presence of the URL does not indicate malicious intent by itself; it is a common API endpoint URL. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration and prompt template for an AI image analysis assistant. It does not contain any malicious code or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected.",
