  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is static configuration with no dynamic or executable components.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 — reasonable given the static nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Although the code is benign, a high score (0.95) might be slightly overstated since it’s purely configuration. A more conservative risk score could be 0.2–0.3, but given the prompt’s potential for misuse, a higher score can be justified as a precaution.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the report correctly dismisses potential vulnerabilities based on static analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 — possibly too high for static config.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is static and contains no malicious behavior, a risk score of 1 seems unjustified. A more appropriate score might be around 0.1–0.2.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the report correctly dismisses potential issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** Slight typo in 'gpt-4o-mini'—possibly a typo, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 — again, possibly overstated.\n- **Justification:** The static nature of the code does not justify a full risk score of 1. Slightly lower scores would be more appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the report correctly notes the typo but dismisses malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware and obfuscation, risk at 1 — likely too high.\n- **Justification:** Static configuration code with no dynamic or malicious activity should have a low risk score, e.g., 0.1.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** No, the report dismisses malicious activity appropriately.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware and obfuscation, risk at 1 — again, probably overstated.\n- **Justification:** Static code with no malicious activity should have a low risk score.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions?** No.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration and prompt templates.\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate at 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are appropriate at 0.\n- The **risk scores** are uniformly high (1), which seems unreasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk scores** should be lowered significantly, perhaps to around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious intent in static configuration code.\n- The high risk scores may have been assigned due to default or overly cautious settings, but in this context, they are unjustified.\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, given static, benign configuration)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign configuration for an AI prompt template, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.**",
