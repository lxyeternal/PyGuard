  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is static configuration with no dynamic or malicious content.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Zero risk is justified; no security issues.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward static configuration.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is static, with a potential typo in the model name ('gpt-4o-mini'), but this is not malicious.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The only concern is the typo, which might cause functional issues but not security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 or less would be more precise; currently, 0 is acceptable.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since no malicious activity is detected, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, static code.\n- The risk scores are 0 or very low, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or negligible; no security risks identified.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the typo in 'gpt-4o-mini'—not malicious, but worth correcting for correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature. No changes are necessary. The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.",
