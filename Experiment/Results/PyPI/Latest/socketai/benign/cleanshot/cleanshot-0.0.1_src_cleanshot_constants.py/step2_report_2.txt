  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe static configuration code with class definitions, constants, and prompt strings.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, network calls, or external data processing are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The URLs are standard API endpoints, and the strings are typical for AI prompt templates.\n- The only minor point is a potential typo in \"gpt-4o-mini\" (Report 3), which is unlikely malicious but could be a configuration error.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; configuration code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign configuration code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No malicious code, but the model name \"gpt-4o-mini\" may be a typo or misconfiguration. This is not malicious but could cause operational issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5? Possibly, but since no malicious behavior is detected, a lower score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious intent; just a possible typo.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Static configuration, no security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Configuration code, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is static configuration and prompt template with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero.\n- The obfuscation scores are all zero.\n- The risk scores are all zero, which is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely static configuration for an AI prompt; no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The only minor concern is a possible typo in the model name, but it does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is static and safe.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and reasonable.**",
