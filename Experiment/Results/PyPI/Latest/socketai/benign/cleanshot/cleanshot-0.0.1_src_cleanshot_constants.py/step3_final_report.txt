  "anomalies": "Typo in model name 'gpt-4o-mini' (likely a typo, not malicious)",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class definitions, constants, and a prompt template string. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or executable logic. The URL is a standard OpenAI API endpoint. The only minor issue is a potential typo in the model name, which does not impact security. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The risk score, however, was previously overestimated; given the static, benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is more appropriate. Overall, the code is benign configuration with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration for an AI prompt template with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor issue is a typo in the model name, which does not affect security. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero; the risk score should be low (~0.1).",
