{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for OpenAI provider constants and a prompt template for image analysis",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string values for API URL, filename, prompt, and configuration; no external input sources",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent, received, or processed dynamically from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration and prompt used",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets appear safe; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains static class attributes and string constants used for API configuration and a detailed prompt for an image analysis task. There are no dynamic inputs, no network operations, and no code execution of untrusted data. The API URL and filenames are hardcoded but not malicious. The prompt string is detailed but intended for AI task specification. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration and prompt template for an AI application. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The code is static and primarily used for data formatting and instruction purposes.",
