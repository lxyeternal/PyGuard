{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and a prompt template for an AI model that analyzes screenshots and generates filenames.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned string values; PROMPT string containing instructions for AI behavior.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely sets static configuration and a prompt template.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL usage, or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a single attribute and several constants including URLs, file names, and a large prompt string. All data is static and hardcoded. The URL points to the OpenAI API, which is standard for such applications. No user input processing, network operations, or dynamic execution is present. No obfuscation, encryption, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a static configuration and prompt template for an AI model to analyze screenshots. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of the OpenAI API URL is typical for intended functionality and not suspicious.",
