  "purpose": "Defines a class for identifying AI providers and sets configuration constants and a prompt template for image analysis.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attributes, especially OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL, PROMPT, and string literals.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is sent or received within this code.",
  "flows": "None; static code with string assignments and class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No network calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for AI providers with a constant for 'openai'. It sets configuration variables like OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL, URL, filename, and a detailed prompt for image analysis. The prompt is static and descriptive. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external data interactions. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration and prompt setup for an image analysis task using an AI model. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
