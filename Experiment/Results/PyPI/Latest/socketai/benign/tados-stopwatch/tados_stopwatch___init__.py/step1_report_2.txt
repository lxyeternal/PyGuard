{
  "purpose": "Implements a GUI-based stopwatch application with start, stop, reset functionalities and callback binding for specific times.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from GUI button presses; calls methods of the Stopwatch class",
  "sinks": "GUI callbacks triggered by user actions; internal method calls updating the display; no external data sinks detected",
  "flows": "User interacts with buttons → triggers Stopwatch methods → updates label via scheduled updater → displays elapsed time",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no malicious callbacks or data leaks. The code uses standard libraries and functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Stopwatch class with typical start, stop, reset, set, and bind methods. The main script creates a Tkinter GUI with buttons linked to these methods. The updater function refreshes the display regularly. No external data transmission, no hidden or malicious code, and no suspicious file or network operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a stopwatch GUI application, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GUI stopwatch application with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It relies solely on standard libraries and user interactions. There are no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
