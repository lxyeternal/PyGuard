{
  "purpose": "Implement a graphical stopwatch application with start, stop, reset functionality, and callback listener support.",
  "sources": "Reading user interaction events via Tkinter buttons, time.monotonic() calls for measuring elapsed time.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling identified; UI updates are purely local.",
  "flows": "User clicks trigger button commands (start, stop, reset), which modify internal stopwatch state; the updater function periodically updates the UI display with the current stopwatch time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears straightforward and intended for local UI timing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Stopwatch class managing timing with callbacks at specified times. It uses time.monotonic() to measure elapsed time safely. The Tkinter UI provides controls for user interaction and periodically updates the display via the updater function. No external data sources, network connections, or hidden behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are typical for a simple GUI stopwatch app, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a local stopwatch with a GUI interface. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It functions solely for timing purposes within a local environment.",
