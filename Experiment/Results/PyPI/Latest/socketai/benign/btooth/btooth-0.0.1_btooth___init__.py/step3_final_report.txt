  "purpose": "Import Bluetooth device management classes from a local module for Bluetooth operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import simply makes classes available in the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic import statement from a local module '.btooth', importing classes related to Bluetooth device management. No execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. The confidence levels are high, and the analysis correctly identifies the lack of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statement alone does not pose any threat. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
