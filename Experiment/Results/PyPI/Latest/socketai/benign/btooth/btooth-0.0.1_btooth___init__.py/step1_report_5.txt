  "purpose": "Import Bluetooth-related classes from a local module named 'btooth'",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, no input reading or external data sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a simple import; no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes: BluetoothDevice, BluetoothEventLoop, and ThreadEventLoop from a local module 'btooth'. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external communication in this snippet. As an isolated import statement, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for Bluetooth-related classes from a local module. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
