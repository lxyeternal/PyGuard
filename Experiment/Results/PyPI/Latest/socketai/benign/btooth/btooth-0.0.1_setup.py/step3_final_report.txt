  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables for version, description, and long description; static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging, importing only standard modules, with all parameters statically defined. No dynamic input, network activity, or data leakage is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk set to zero. The code's simplicity and static nature make it highly unlikely to contain malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence and reports support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
