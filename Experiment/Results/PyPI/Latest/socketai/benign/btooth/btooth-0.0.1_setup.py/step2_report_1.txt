  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic input, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The code matches the original provided, and no issues are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nGiven the code's benign nature, these scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nSince all scores are zero for malware and security risk, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe code contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic. The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and based on static analysis, correctly avoiding assumptions about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature—no risks, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static setup script with no dynamic input, no external data processing, and no suspicious patterns. All evidence points to a benign package configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No security issues are present, and the scores reflect the code's benign nature.",
