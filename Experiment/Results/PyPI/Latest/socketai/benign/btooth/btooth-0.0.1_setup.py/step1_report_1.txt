  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'btooth' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants defined at the beginning (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; setup() arguments are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "Constants and static values flow into setup() parameters for package configuration; no untrusted input flows into these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata. It performs a straightforward package setup with static strings and no dynamic or user input. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic are present. The code is typical for Python package configuration, and no anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
