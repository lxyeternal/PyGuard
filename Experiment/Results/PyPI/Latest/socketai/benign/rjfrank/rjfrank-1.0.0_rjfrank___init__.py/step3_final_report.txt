  "purpose": "A playful module providing static data, random quotes, easter eggs, and dynamic attribute access for entertainment or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Static lists (_MOVIE_QUOTES, _RETIRE_MESSAGES, _EASTER_EGGS), attribute access via __getattr__, and random.choice functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network communication, or data output present.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__) retrieves data from static variables or easter eggs; no external data flows or processing beyond internal static data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __del__ method to print a message upon object deletion; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static, entertainment-oriented module with random quote functions, easter eggs, and dynamic attribute access. It replaces itself in sys.modules with a custom class, which is a common pattern for plugins or singleton modules. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The __del__ method only prints a message, which is benign but unconventional. The static data and methods are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1) are appropriate; the slight security risk score is due to the __del__ print, which is harmless. Overall, the code is benign, playful, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code poses no security threat or malicious behavior. It is a static, playful module with no vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, aligning with the benign analysis. The existing scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are correct; the security risk score can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, but 0.1 is acceptable given the __del__ print. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
