  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation, including path setup, extensions, theme, and output options.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from environment variables (e.g., RTD_VERSION), imports (os, sys, shutil), and the script's own code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system or data leak occurs; no external network calls or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows indicative of malicious data processing; code primarily handles filesystem operations and documentation setup.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is a print statement at the end that outputs a loading message; no handling of untrusted input or sensitive data observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard configuration for Sphinx documentation generation. It performs path setup, attempts to run sphinx-apidoc with version checks, handles exceptions gracefully, and sets various configuration options for HTML and LaTeX output. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The only external influence is the print statement, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious configuration script for documentation purposes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
