  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the validity of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script, executing routine setup tasks, including calling `sphinx-apidoc`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The execution of external commands is standard in documentation workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on filesystem cleanup and command execution.\n- **Findings:** Uses `shutil.rmtree` and constructs a command for `sphinx-apidoc`. No suspicious behavior or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Configures Sphinx, handles environment variables, and runs `sphinx-apidoc`.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The print statement is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Sets up documentation, removes directories, runs `sphinx-apidoc`.\n- **Findings:** Filesystem operations and subprocess calls are standard. Slight mention of `securityRisk` at 0.1, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score is acceptable given filesystem operations, but no actual threat. Could be lowered to 0, but not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar documentation setup with external command execution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero; the only slightly elevated is 0.1 in Report 4, which is acceptable given filesystem modifications but not indicative of a security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — routine setup with no security implications.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight risk score in one report is justified by filesystem operations but does not indicate a real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with a benign, routine documentation setup script. No adjustments needed.",
