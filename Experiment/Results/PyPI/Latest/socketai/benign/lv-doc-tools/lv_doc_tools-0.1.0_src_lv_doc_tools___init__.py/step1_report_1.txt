{
  "purpose": "The code determines the package version by importing the appropriate metadata module based on Python version and handles missing package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the module's name (__name__) and attempts to retrieve its version using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code only accesses package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads __name__ → attempts to get version → assigns __version__; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on Python version is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The use of del on imported functions is somewhat uncommon but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles differences in Python versions for metadata access. It tries to retrieve its own package version and defaults to 'unknown' if not found. The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It follows common patterns for package version retrieval with no hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for obtaining package version information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for package setup or runtime version checks.",
