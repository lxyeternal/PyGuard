{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information for the current module, handling different Python versions and missing package scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__) and attempts to get its version via the version() function from importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to external systems or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "The version(__name__) call flows from the module name to the version retrieval function, with exception handling for missing packages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del' to remove imported functions is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports version retrieval functions based on Python version, then attempts to get its own package version using __name__. It handles missing packages gracefully by setting __version__ to 'unknown'. The use of 'del' on imported symbols is unconventional but harmless. No untrusted input, network activity, or code injection is involved. All signals indicate standard, benign behavior with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's function and security profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe pattern for obtaining package version information, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and reflect its benign nature.",
