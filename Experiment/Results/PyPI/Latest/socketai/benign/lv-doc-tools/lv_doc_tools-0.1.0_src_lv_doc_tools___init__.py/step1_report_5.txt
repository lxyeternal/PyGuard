{
  "purpose": "Determine the version of the current package or module using importlib metadata APIs.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and attempts to retrieve its version via importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the version to __version__ (likely used elsewhere); no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the appropriate module, setting dist_name, retrieving version info, and assigning it to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Use of try-except-finally for version retrieval is standard. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to import correct metadata API. It attempts to retrieve the package version for the current module name. The use of __name__ as dist_name may be standard in package modules. Error handling assigns 'unknown' if package not found. The cleanup of imported names in finally is typical but unnecessary for security purposes. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard method for obtaining package version information. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate version handling code typical in Python packaging.",
