  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code conditionally imports version retrieval functions based on Python version.\n- It uses `__name__` as the package/module name to get its version.\n- It handles the case where the package isn't found by setting `__version__` to \"unknown\".\n- It deletes imported symbols afterward.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Accurate; reads `__name__`, attempts to get version.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external or untrusted input processing.\n- Anomalies: Slightly unusual use of `del`, but not malicious.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly identifies the code as standard, safe, with no malicious intent.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Correct; same as above.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external data sinks.\n- Anomalies: Standard compatibility handling.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly notes the code's standard nature and safety.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external sinks.\n- Anomalies: Standard pattern.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Properly describes the code as a typical version retrieval snippet.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Correct; reads `__name__`, calls `version()`.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external data leaks.\n- Anomalies: Standard pattern.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Correctly interprets the code as benign, standard, with no malicious intent.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same as others.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external or untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: Uses `__name__` in a typical way.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Appropriately describes the code as straightforward and safe.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is a standard pattern for package version retrieval.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any external communication.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a typical, benign snippet used for package version detection, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threats. No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports.",
