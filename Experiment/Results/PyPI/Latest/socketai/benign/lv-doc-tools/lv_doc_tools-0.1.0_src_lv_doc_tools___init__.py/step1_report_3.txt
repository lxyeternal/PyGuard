{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata depending on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads the __name__ variable to determine the package name; imports version information from the respective library based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Assigns version info to __version__; no external data sinks or outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Imports library based on Python version -> uses package name (__name__) -> retrieves version -> assigns to __version__ -> cleanup by deleting imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard library modules and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports version retrieval functions based on Python version, then attempts to get the package version for the current module/package name. Uses exception handling to set __version__ to 'unknown' if package not found. Cleans up imported symbols. The code appears to be standard for package version retrieval, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version retrieval snippet for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard operations safely and correctly.",
