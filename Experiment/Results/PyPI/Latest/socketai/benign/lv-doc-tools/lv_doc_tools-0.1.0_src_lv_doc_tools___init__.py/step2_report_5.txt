  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard pattern for retrieving package version info, with conditional imports based on Python version.\n- It uses `__name__` as the package name to get the version.\n- Exception handling is in place for missing packages.\n- No external data, network calls, or untrusted input processing.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **matches** the descriptions in all reports.\n- It **correctly** handles Python version differences.\n- It **uses** `__name__` as the package name, which is typical.\n- It **does not** process untrusted input, nor does it contain backdoors or obfuscation.\n- The use of `del` on imported functions is unusual but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only minor point is that `del` on imported functions is unnecessary for security and might be considered unconventional, but it's not harmful.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5. Since the code is benign, a score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- No suspicious logic or data flow.\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence from the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe utility for package version retrieval. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
