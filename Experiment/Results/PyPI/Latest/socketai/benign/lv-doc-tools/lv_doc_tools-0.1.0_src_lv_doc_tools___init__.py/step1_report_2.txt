  "purpose": "Determine the package version using importlib.metadata or fallback to importlib_metadata based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads the __name__ variable for package name, and the version() function for package version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads __name__ to determine package name, then calls version() with this name, and assigns __version__ based on the result.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for compatibility, nothing unusual or suspicious; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the appropriate metadata module depending on Python version. It attempts to get the package version using the package name (__name__). If the package is not found, it assigns 'unknown' to __version__. The use of try-except-finally blocks is standard. No external network calls, no data leakage, no suspicious logic or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and version retrieval snippet for Python packages. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
