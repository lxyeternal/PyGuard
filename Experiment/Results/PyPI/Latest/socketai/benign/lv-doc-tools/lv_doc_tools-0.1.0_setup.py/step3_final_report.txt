{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py for packaging a Python project generated by PyScaffold, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input; the script reads no external data, only calls setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: calling setup() within a try-except block; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The broad except clause could mask errors but is common in setup scripts; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The exception handling is broad but typical, and no untrusted data or malicious sinks are involved. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the benign nature accurately, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a minimal security risk score due to broad exception handling, which is acceptable in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
