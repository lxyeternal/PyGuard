  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is non-operational and static.",
  "anomalies": "The file is mostly comments with a single commented import statement; no active code, data handling, or dynamic behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, mostly commented template with no executable logic. It contains only documentation comments and a commented-out import statement for pytest. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. It does not perform any data input/output, network operations, or system modifications.",
