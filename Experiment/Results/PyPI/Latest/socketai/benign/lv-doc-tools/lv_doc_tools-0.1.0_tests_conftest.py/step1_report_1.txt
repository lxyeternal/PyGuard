  "purpose": "This is a placeholder conftest.py file for pytest configuration, containing only comments and an import statement that is commented out.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists since the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only comments and a commented-out import; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and contains only descriptive comments about the purpose of conftest.py in pytest. The import statement for pytest is commented out, indicating no active code execution or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are typical for a placeholder configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder file with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity. It simply provides documentation and a commented-out import statement with no operational impact.",
