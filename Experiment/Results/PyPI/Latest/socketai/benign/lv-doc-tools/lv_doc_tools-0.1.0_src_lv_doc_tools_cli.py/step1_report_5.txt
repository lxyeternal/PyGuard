{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to generate documentation for LabView projects using the lv_doc_tools library by loading a configuration JSON file and executing documentation build process.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the command line argument 'config' which specifies the path to a JSON configuration file.",
  "sinks": "Reads the JSON configuration file, which could potentially contain sensitive data. No other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input source (command line argument) -> File read operation -> JSON parsing -> Use of configuration data in Doc_Generator -> Documentation build process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets observed. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code paths identified.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a configuration file path as an argument, reads the file contents, parses JSON data, and passes this data to a documentation generator class. The flow is straightforward with standard error handling. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. Usage of external library 'lv_doc_tools.generator' appears to be legitimate for documentation purposes. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for generating documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical file I/O, JSON parsing, and calls to an external library without any suspicious behaviors.",
