  "purpose": "Read a JSON configuration file specified via command-line, handle errors, and pass the data to an external documentation generator to produce documentation.",
  "sources": "Reading the configuration filename from command-line arguments, opening and reading the JSON file.",
  "sinks": "Passing the loaded JSON data directly to the external 'Doc_Generator' class without validation.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> open file -> json.load() -> pass data to Doc_Generator -> build_docs()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that loads a JSON config and invokes an external library to generate documentation. It handles common exceptions properly. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The data is passed directly to an external component, which could be a concern if that component is malicious, but the script itself is benign. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are observed. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. The external library's trustworthiness is outside the scope, but based on the code alone, no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, but a score of 0 could also be justified given the lack of any suspicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
