{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to generate documentation for LabView projects using an external library (lv_doc_tools.generator). It reads a configuration JSON file, loads it, and uses it to invoke a documentation generator.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the command-line argument for the configuration file path and the content of that JSON file when opened.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; data flows from file input into JSON parsing and then into the external library (Doc_Generator). No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or stored.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> File read -> JSON load -> External library Doc_Generator(config) -> build_docs()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code follows standard patterns for CLI tools and JSON handling.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles file input with proper error handling for file not found and JSON decode errors. It loads configuration data and passes it to an external library, which is a normal pattern. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code are evident. Usage of the external library is legitimate given the context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI tool for generating documentation using an external library. It handles inputs and errors appropriately without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security concerns are identified based on this code alone.",
