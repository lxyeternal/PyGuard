{
  "purpose": "The code generates documentation for LabView projects using the lv_doc_tools library by reading a configuration JSON file and invoking the Doc_Generator class.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the configuration file specified by the command line argument 'config'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform dangerous operations; it mainly reads a file and calls a library function.",
  "flows": "Input from 'args.config' is read and parsed as JSON; the parsed data is passed to the Doc_Generator constructor, which then executes 'build_docs()'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The use of standard libraries and straightforward control flow indicates typical scripting.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a JSON configuration file path, loads and parses it safely, and passes it to an external library (lv_doc_tools). It includes standard error handling for file not found and JSON decoding issues. The flow is simple and typical for a CLI utility; no untrusted data is sent over the network or stored insecurely. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for generating documentation, with no malicious or malicious-looking behaviors. It relies on an external library for core functionality and handles errors gracefully. No security risks or malware are evident.",
