{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various data types related to datasets or file formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines an enum class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to a leak or effect.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted sources; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python enum syntax, with a decorator to enforce unique enum values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines a class DataType decorated with @enum.unique, assigning integer values to different dataset formats. It is a straightforward, static definition with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign enumeration class defining data types. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
