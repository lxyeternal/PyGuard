  "purpose": "Define a unique enumeration class for data types related to neuroimaging or similar datasets.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code solely defines an enum class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing or transmission present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module, defines a class DataType using enum.Enum with the @enum.unique decorator to ensure all members are unique, and assigns integer values to various dataset identifiers. The implementation is straightforward, standard for defining enumerations. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration definition intended for dataset type identifiers. It presents no malicious intent or security risks.",
