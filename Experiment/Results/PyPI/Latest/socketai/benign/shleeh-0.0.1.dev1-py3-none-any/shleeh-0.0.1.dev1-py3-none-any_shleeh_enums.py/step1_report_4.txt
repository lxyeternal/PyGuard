  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different data types related to datasets or file formats.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No potential data leak points or untrusted data outputs in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of enum with unique decorator is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines an enumeration class with several named constants, each assigned an integer value. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python enum usage. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an enumeration class used to categorize data types. It contains no malicious intent or security issues.",
