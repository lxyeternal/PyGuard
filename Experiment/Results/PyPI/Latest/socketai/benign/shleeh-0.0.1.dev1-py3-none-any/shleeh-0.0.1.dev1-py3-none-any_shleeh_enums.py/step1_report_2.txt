{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for data types used in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no outputs or data handling that could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code solely defines a class with constants.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The use of enum is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module, defines a unique enumeration class 'DataType' with five data type constants. It appears to serve as a simple, static data structure for categorizing data types. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is minimal and well-structured, with no hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate codebase.",
