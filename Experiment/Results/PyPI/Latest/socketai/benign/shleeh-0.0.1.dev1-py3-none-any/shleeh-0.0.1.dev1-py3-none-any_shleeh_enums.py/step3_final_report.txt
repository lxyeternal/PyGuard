{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of dataset type constants for use in data processing or categorization.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static enum class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constant definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum class with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module, defines a unique enumeration class 'DataType' with five members assigned integer values. It is a static, declarative structure with no dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, correctly assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
