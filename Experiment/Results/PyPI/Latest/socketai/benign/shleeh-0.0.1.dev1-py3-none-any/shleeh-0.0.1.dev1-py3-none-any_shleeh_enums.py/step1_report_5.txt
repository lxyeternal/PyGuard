  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various data types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of enum.unique decorator; no unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enumeration class using Python's enum module. It assigns integer values to specific data type identifiers and enforces uniqueness with the enum.unique decorator. There are no input sources, data flows, or output sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity. The structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a data type enumeration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
