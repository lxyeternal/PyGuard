{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package/module by importing specific components from local modules and defining metadata such as version and exportable names.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.enums' and '.errors' modules, and the assignment of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in symbols from local modules; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs standard imports and defines package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden payloads. It adheres to common Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports modules and sets metadata.",
