  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module initialization script, primarily importing local modules and setting metadata.\n- No external data handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to follow standard Python packaging conventions.\n- The `__version__` string is a typical development version, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The `__all__` list explicitly defines exported symbols, which is standard practice.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   None of the reports find any issues, anomalies, or suspicious behavior in the code. The code is static, simple, and adheres to common patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   No logical errors or flaws are noted. The code's purpose and implementation are clear and correct for a module initialization file.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**  \n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious intent or behavior is detected.\n   - Obfuscation score of 0 is justified; code is clear and readable.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**  \n   - The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, this is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious module setup script with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. All indicators point to a benign, well-structured initialization file.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no issues to address. The scores reflect its benign nature appropriately.",
