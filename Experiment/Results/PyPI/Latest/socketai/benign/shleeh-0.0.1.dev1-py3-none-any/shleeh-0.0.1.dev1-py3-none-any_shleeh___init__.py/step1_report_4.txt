  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization file that imports specific components and defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.enums and .errors), and the assignment of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no user input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical points; purely static assignment and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static imports and metadata definitions. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data processing that could lead to security risks. It appears to be a typical __init__.py or module setup file for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module initialization script with no harmful intent.",
