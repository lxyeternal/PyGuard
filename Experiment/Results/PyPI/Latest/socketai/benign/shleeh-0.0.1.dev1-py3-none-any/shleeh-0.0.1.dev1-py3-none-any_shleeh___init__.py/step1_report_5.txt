  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports from internal modules. No external inputs, network calls, or data processing are present. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe.",
