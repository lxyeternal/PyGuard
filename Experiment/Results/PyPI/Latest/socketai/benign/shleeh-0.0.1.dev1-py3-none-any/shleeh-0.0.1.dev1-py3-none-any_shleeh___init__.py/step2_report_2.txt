  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports all symbols from `.enums` and `.errors`.\n- It sets `__version__` to `'0.0.1.dev1'`.\n- It defines `__all__` with a few exported symbols: `'__version__'`, `'DataType'`, `'Error'`, `'FileNotValidError'`.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python module initialization script, likely an `__init__.py`.\n- It performs static imports, defines version info, and specifies public API exports.\n- There are no external data inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n- The version string `'0.0.1.dev1'` is standard for development versions.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They note the absence of data flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence level in each report is 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is a benign module setup script.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
