{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module initialization script that imports specific enums and error classes and defines module metadata and export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.enums and .errors), setting __version__, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports modules and sets variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules, sets version info, and defines what symbols to export. It does not process user input, execute untrusted code, or perform network or file operations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or sensitive data access indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only manages imports and module metadata.",
