  "purpose": "Module initialization and metadata setup for a Python package, importing local modules and defining exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.enums, .errors), setting __version__, defining __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports and variable definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py or module setup file, importing local modules, defining version and public API. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. The code is static, clear, and adheres to common Python packaging patterns. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The version string indicates a development version, which is typical. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform risky operations, or contain hidden malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
