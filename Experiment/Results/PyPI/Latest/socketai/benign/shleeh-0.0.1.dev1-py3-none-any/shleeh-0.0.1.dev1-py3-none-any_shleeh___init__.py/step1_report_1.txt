  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization file, mainly importing components and setting module metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.enums and .errors), assignment of __version__, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or external communication is involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; module imports and variable definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module setup tasks: importing local modules, defining version info, and specifying public API exports. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no potential attack vectors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
