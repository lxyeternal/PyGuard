  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines two classes: `Error` and `FileNotValidError`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no data flows, no input/output operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes, there is no justification for any risk scores above 0.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security risks are present.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is accurate.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activities are suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard and benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My Own Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and has no security or malicious implications.",
