  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'Error' and a derived class 'FileNotValidError' with an initializer storing 'file_name' and 'data_type'. There are no external data sources, no data flows, no code execution, and no embedded secrets. The code is purely for error handling, typical in Python. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure is standard and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. It is a standard implementation of custom exception classes, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with its harmless, straightforward nature.",
