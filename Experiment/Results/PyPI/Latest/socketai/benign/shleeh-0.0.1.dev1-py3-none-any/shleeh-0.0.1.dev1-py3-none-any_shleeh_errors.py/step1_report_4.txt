  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file validation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard class and exception definitions; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'Error' and a derived exception 'FileNotValidError' with an initializer that stores filename and data type. No input reading, external data handling, or suspicious operations are present. The structure is typical for custom exceptions in Python. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors are evident. There are no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and purposeful for validation purposes.",
