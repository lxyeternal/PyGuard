  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to invalid files",
  "sources": "No external data input or reading operations present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths in the code",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom exception classes is standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'Error' and a derived exception 'FileNotValidError' with an initializer that stores filename and data type. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is typical for custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger error handling module without any signs of malicious behavior.",
