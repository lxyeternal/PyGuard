  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file validation.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions: a base exception class 'Error' and a derived exception 'FileNotValidError' that stores filename and data type. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard Python exception class definitions used for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and standard in structure.",
