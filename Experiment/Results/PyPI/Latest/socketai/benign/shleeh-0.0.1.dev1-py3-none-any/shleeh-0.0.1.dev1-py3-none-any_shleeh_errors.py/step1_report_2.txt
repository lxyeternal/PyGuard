  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a base exception class 'Error' and a derived class 'FileNotValidError' with a constructor that stores filename and data type. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It functions purely as a custom exception setup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
