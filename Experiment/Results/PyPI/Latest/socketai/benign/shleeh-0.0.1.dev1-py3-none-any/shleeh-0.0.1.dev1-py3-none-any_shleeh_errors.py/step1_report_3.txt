{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to file validation",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; only class definitions and initializations",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths, as the code solely defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'Error' and a derived class 'FileNotValidError' with an initializer that stores file name and data type. No input, output, or external data handling occurs. The structure is typical for custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
