  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The code defines a base exception class `Error` and a derived class `FileNotValidError` with an `__init__` method that stores `file_name` and `data_type`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no data flows, no input/output operations, no code execution, and no embedded secrets.\n   - The code is purely class definitions for error handling, typical in Python.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Assessment**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Claims**:\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, the risk scores should remain very low.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Summary and Final Justification**:\n   - The code is a standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code snippet is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scoring reflects its harmless, standard nature.",
