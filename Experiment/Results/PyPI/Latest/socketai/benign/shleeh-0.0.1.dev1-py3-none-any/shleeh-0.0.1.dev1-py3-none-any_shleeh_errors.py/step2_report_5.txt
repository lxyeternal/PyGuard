  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \n   The provided code defines two classes:\n   - `Error`: a base exception class.\n   - `FileNotValidError`: a derived exception class that stores `file_name` and `data_type`.\n\n   There are no external data sources, no data flows, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is a straightforward class definition for custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation**:  \n   - **Presence of Issues**: The reports correctly identify that the code is simple and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - **Malware and Obfuscation**: All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - **Risk Scores**: All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Score Justification**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that defining custom exception classes is inherently safe, which is correct.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made or implied.\n   - No unusual patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
