  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a base exception class `Error` and a derived class `FileNotValidError` with an initializer that stores `file_name` and `data_type`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no data flows, no input/output operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes, typical in Python error handling modules.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The structure is standard and safe.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and idiomatic for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n   - The constructor correctly stores parameters; no issues are apparent.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting clear understanding.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions, the overall security risk remains negligible.\n   - No modifications are necessary based on the provided reports.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
