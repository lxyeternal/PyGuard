  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes in Python. It contains no external data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify that the code is simple and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's nature. Since the code is purely defining classes with no external interactions, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code does not perform any external data handling, code execution, or contain any malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a standard exception class definition.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nThe code is a minimal, clean implementation of custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, standard, and free of security concerns.",
