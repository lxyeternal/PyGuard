  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing and displaying crossword scores, including user information, dates, and times.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the parameters passed to constructors: username, crossword_date, time_in_seconds, and the list of Score objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "The data flows from object instantiation to string representation, with internal methods calculating max field lengths for display formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden activities observed. The use of Unicode EM DASH for display does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, with clear separation of data representation (Score class) and collection management/display (ScoreCollection). It uses standard Python features for data handling and formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. No external input handling or network operations are present. The code solely focuses on data encapsulation and formatted display, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward implementation of score management and display functionality with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
