  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain computational or data processing task, possibly involving network or system interactions based on the import statements.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading environment variables, user input, or external files; specific input points are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly visible in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs towards processing functions, and then possibly towards outputs or external calls, but specifics are unclear without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated segments are evident. The code structure appears straightforward, with no unusual language features or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code has been examined at multiple points, including imports, functions, and execution flow. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No unsafe practices like insecure eval, SQL injection points, or environment variable leaks are evident. The code appears to be standard and benign based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems legitimate with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
