  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for HTML parsing and tag attribute management. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The only minor security concern is dependency on external JSONL configuration files, which could be tampered with in a supply chain attack, but this does not reflect malicious code within the module itself."
