  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for HTML manipulation using lxml, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Removing elements from DOM; standard operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions are straightforward, safe, and standard. No malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate, as no security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** DOM modifications, standard removal operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; straightforward logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions are benign, possibly used for sanitization or content filtering. No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 — justified as removal functions could be misused to hide malicious content, but inherently benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Similar utility functions, no external data sources.\n- No suspicious code or patterns.\n- Functions only manipulate HTML DOM; no external effects.\n- Conclusion: benign utility code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar analysis, no external data sources or malicious patterns.\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- Could be misused if external input is untrusted, but this is a common risk with DOM manipulation utilities.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (or 0.2, as per the report, considering potential misuse but not inherent risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar functions, standard DOM operations.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Potential concern if external input is untrusted, but the functions themselves are benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable, considering the possibility of misuse.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code in all reports is present and matches the description.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** Correctly assigned as 0, no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports due to potential misuse, which is reasonable given the nature of DOM manipulation utilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard set of HTML utility functions.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The only slight concern is potential misuse if external input is untrusted, but this is a typical caveat with such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, primarily due to potential misuse, but not inherent)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for typical use in HTML processing pipelines.",
