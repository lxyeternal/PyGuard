{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for manipulating and removing HTML elements from an lxml.html.HtmlElement tree based on tag types, style conditions, or custom conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML elements from the provided root element and its descendants, especially when selecting elements via XPath or iterating over all elements.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the DOM tree by removing elements; however, it does not write to external systems, handle untrusted input directly, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Elements are selected via XPath or iteration, then potentially removed based on conditions; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The style replacement in 'is_display_none' might be simplified but is not suspicious. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The functions focus on manipulating an HTML DOM: 'remove_reversely' removes elements in reverse order; 'remove_tags_by_types' removes specific tags; 'is_display_none' checks for 'display:none' in style attribute; 'remove_tags_with_condition' removes elements based on a custom condition. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code could be part of a sanitizer or processor for HTML content. No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for HTML DOM manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided HTML elements without external side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
