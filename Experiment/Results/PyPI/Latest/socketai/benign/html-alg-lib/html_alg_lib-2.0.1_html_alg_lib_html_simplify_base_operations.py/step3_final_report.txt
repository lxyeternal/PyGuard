  "sources": "Reading HTML elements via lxml's xpath and iteration.",
  "sinks": "Removing elements from the DOM tree.",
  "flows": "Source: xpath or iteration -> sink: parent.remove(element).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DOM manipulation tasks: removing elements by type, style, or condition. It uses common lxml methods without external data or network interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The functions could be misused to hide malicious content if used on untrusted input, but this is a typical risk for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of standard HTML manipulation utilities. No malware, obfuscation, or inherent security risks are detected. The small potential misuse risk is context-dependent and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
