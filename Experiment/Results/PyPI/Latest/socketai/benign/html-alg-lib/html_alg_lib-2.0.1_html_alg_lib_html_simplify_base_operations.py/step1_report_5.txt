{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to manipulate and remove HTML elements from a document tree, based on tag types or custom conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'root' HTML element and its descendants, via root.xpath() and root.iter().",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if external input is passed into 'root' without validation, especially via 'xpath' queries or custom conditions, but no direct untrusted data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The input 'root' is traversed via xpath or iteration, and certain elements are removed based on conditions. No data is transmitted externally or stored; the flow is limited to DOM manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The functions perform standard HTML DOM operations. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for removing elements from an HTML tree: 'remove_reversely' deletes elements in reverse order; 'remove_tags_by_types' removes specified tags via XPath; 'is_display_none' checks inline style for display:none; 'remove_tags_with_condition' removes elements matching a custom condition. The use of 'lxml' and standard DOM methods are typical. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code could be misused if external input is untrusted and directly passed as 'root', but this is standard for such utilities and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard HTML manipulation utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be safe for use in HTML processing pipelines, assuming proper input validation is maintained elsewhere.",
