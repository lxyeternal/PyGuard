  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating and removing HTML elements based on tag types, display styles, or custom conditions within an lxml HTML document.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML elements via root.xpath() and root.iter(), accessing element attributes (e.g., 'style')",
  "sinks": "Removing elements from the DOM tree, which can affect the structure and content of the processed HTML document",
  "flows": "Reading elements via xpath and iteration, then conditionally removing them, modifying the document structure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of reversed removal for DOM manipulation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to remove HTML elements based on tag types, display:none styles, or custom conditions. It uses standard lxml methods such as xpath() and iter(). The remove_reversely function ensures safe removal during iteration. No network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for HTML manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. Its purpose seems to be content filtering or cleanup.",
