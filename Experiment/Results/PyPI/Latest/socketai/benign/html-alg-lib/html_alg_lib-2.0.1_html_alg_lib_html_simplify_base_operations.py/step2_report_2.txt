  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The functions are straightforward HTML utilities—removing tags, checking display:none, etc. No suspicious patterns, no network or external data operations, no obfuscation, credentials, or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard DOM manipulation code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the standard nature of DOM operations. The only minor note is the 'style' string manipulation, which is typical.  \n- **Potential concern:** The code could be misused to hide malicious content, but the functions themselves are neutral.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 reflects that, in an adversarial context, these utilities could be used maliciously to hide harmful content. This is a reasonable assessment. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, standard HTML DOM utilities with no malicious behavior. The 'is_display_none' function only checks styles but does not act on them.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, standard DOM manipulation functions. No external data, no network, no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern—safe, standard functions. The note about potential misuse if external input is untrusted is valid but not indicative of malicious code within the functions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** Most are 0, with a few at 0.2 to account for potential misuse if the functions are employed maliciously. This is reasonable given the context.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal inherent risk, mainly if misused to hide content, but the functions themselves are benign.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard set of HTML utilities with no malicious intent.",
