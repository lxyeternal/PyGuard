{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for manipulating HTML elements, specifically removing elements by tags, conditions, or in reverse order.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from html.HtmlElement objects via methods like get() and iter() in functions, primarily within the remove_tags_by_types, is_display_none, and remove_tags_with_condition functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions manipulate the DOM tree structure, removing elements from the parent node, which is a safe operation. No data is written to external systems or used in a way that would cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The functions identify target elements via XPath or condition and remove them from the DOM tree, with no external data flow or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. The code relies solely on standard libraries and provided input objects. No unusual or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward HTML DOM manipulation functions, such as removing elements by list or condition, and checking for display:none styles. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of reversed order for removal is standard to avoid iteration issues. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The functions operate solely on provided HTML elements, with no external dependencies or code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility set for HTML manipulation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely removes elements based on provided criteria without external side effects or malicious behaviors.",
