  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions for manipulating HTML DOM trees: removing elements by type, style, or condition.\n- No network, file, or environment interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The removal functions are standard DOM manipulation techniques.\n- The only potential concern is misuse—if untrusted input is passed, malicious content could be hidden or removed—but this is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for HTML manipulation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, standard use of lxml.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware, no security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, standard DOM operations.\n- **Potential misuse:** Could be used maliciously to hide content.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility functions are benign; misuse potential is context-dependent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Justification:** Since the code itself is neutral, assigning a small security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, reflecting potential misuse in a broader context.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for DOM manipulation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, safe operations.\n- **Potential misuse:** Similar to above, possible to hide malicious content.\n- **Conclusion:** The functions are benign; risks depend on usage context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same utility functions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Potential risks:** If untrusted input is used, could hide malicious content, but the functions themselves are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Justification:** Similar to report 2, assigning a small security risk score is reasonable, given the potential for misuse.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.2 to reflect potential misuse.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, mainly related to potential misuse if the functions are used on untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard DOM manipulation utilities, with no malware or obfuscation. The small security risk scores reflect the potential for misuse, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.",
