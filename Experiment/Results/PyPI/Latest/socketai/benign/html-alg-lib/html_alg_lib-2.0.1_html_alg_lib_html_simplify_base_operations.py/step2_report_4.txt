  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, scores, and potential inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for HTML manipulation, no malicious code, no obfuscation, malware score 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, standard DOM manipulation functions. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard DOM manipulation, no suspicious code, minor security risk (0.2) due to potential misuse.\n- **Analysis:** The functions could be used maliciously if employed to hide malicious content, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.2 is justified given potential misuse, even if the code is benign. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard HTML utility functions, no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, malware=0.\n- **Analysis:** The functions are neutral, with no signs of malware or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment, benign HTML DOM manipulation, no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The functions are safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 fit well.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard DOM manipulation, potential misuse if external input is untrusted, but no inherent malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The note about potential misuse is valid, but the functions themselves are neutral.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seems appropriate, given the possibility of misuse.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behaviors. Malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation. Obfuscated=0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.2, justified by potential misuse but not inherent risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- The slight risk scores (0.2) are justified considering potential misuse in malicious contexts, but they do not reflect actual malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, mainly potential misuse, not inherent risk)\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
