{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for manipulating and removing HTML elements from an lxml html tree based on tag types or conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads HTML elements via the input parameters (root elements, element lists). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Removals of elements from the DOM tree could potentially be used maliciously to hide content or modify the document structure, but in isolation, these are standard DOM manipulations.",
  "flows": "The functions select elements based on tag names or conditions and remove them from the parent elements, altering the DOM structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code uses straightforward logic for DOM manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to remove HTML elements either by reversing through a list of elements, by tag types via XPath, or by a custom condition. The remove_reversely function ensures safe removal without iterator issues. The is_display_none function checks inline styles for display:none but does not act upon it directly. All operations are standard DOM manipulations, with no network, file, or environment variable access. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code could be used in a malicious context if employed to hide or remove harmful or malicious content, but the functions themselves are neutral and common for HTML processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for HTML DOM manipulation, with no inherent malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is benign and standard in nature, primarily used for cleaning or modifying HTML content. No malicious signals or security risks are detected.",
