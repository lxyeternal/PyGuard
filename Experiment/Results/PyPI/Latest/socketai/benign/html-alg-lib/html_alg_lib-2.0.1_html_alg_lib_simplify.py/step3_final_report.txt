{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to process HTML strings using configurable pipelines, loading configurations from static assets, and returning processed data or simplified HTML.",
  "sources": "Input HTML string, configuration files loaded via get_default_cfg or read_cfg functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed data as dictionaries or strings; no external network or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "HTML input -> configuration loading -> pipeline application -> output data or HTML string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration-based HTML processing using external modules. It reads configs from local assets, constructs pipelines, and applies them to HTML strings, returning structured results. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The use of copy.deepcopy for performance optimization and dynamic config loading are standard practices. External modules are assumed benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores should be set to 0. The overall security risk score can be confidently assigned as 0.1, reflecting the minimal potential risk associated with configuration handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
