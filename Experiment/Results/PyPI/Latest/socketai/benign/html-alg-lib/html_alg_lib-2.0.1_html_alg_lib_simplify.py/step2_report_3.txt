  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Functions for processing HTML strings via configurable pipelines.\n- Configurations are loaded from static assets directory.\n- Functions include: `process_to_label_alg_html`, `process_to_cls_alg_html`, `general_simplify`.\n- Use of `copy.deepcopy` for performance optimization.\n- External modules `read_cfg` and `Pipeline` are used.\n- No network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- Results are returned as dictionaries or strings.\n- No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly identifies the data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds the code benign, standard data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low).  \n**Comment:** Reasonable. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Comment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid, straightforward processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n**Comment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still low. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n**Comment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Comment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree the code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- The code is purely data processing with no network, code injection, or malicious logic.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The code is safe but involves reading external configuration files and applying pipelines, which could be a vector if the configs are malicious, but given the context, the risk remains minimal.  \n- The existing scores (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, but I would suggest a **risk score of 0.0** for maximum confidence, unless there's external threat context.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Value | Justification |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | **0**            | No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors. |\n| Obfuscated   | **0**            | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation. |\n| Risk         | **0**            | No evident security risk; configuration-based processing is standard. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my analysis. The code is a standard, benign HTML processing utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, but always ensure configuration files are securely managed to prevent malicious modifications.",
