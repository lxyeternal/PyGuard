{
  "purpose": "This code processes HTML content through various pipelines for simplification or labeling, using configurable pipelines and applying them to HTML strings.",
  "sources": "Input HTML string (`html_str`) and configuration files (via `pipeline_cfg`, `get_default_cfg`) which are read from local files or provided directly.",
  "sinks": "Data returned in dictionaries containing processed results (`record`, `info`), potentially exposing internal pipeline data, but no direct data leaks or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "HTML input -> pipeline application -> processed record -> output dictionary or string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic configuration loading and pipeline application appears standard. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No network, file system, or privilege escalation activities evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (`copy`, `os`) and external modules for configuration reading and pipeline processing. It defines functions to load default configurations, process HTML for labeling and classification, and perform general simplification. These functions incorporate safe file handling, deep copying of configurations to avoid side effects, and conditional processing based on parameters like 'fast'. The pipelines are instantiated from configurations, and results are returned without executing untrusted code or external commands. No suspicious data flows, code injections, or obfuscated code structures are present. The operations are straightforward processing routines with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTML processing utility that applies configurable pipelines for simplification and labeling. It reads configuration files from local assets, processes HTML inputs, and returns structured results. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
