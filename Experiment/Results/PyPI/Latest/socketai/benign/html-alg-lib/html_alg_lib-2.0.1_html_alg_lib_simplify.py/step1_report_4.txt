{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for processing HTML content through configurable pipelines for simplification and classification tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration files via get_default_cfg and read_cfg functions, and takes HTML strings as input for processing.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and returned as dictionaries or strings, with no external output channels or untrusted data being sent externally.",
  "flows": "HTML input flows into pipeline.apply_to_html; configuration files flow into read_cfg; processed data flows into return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The configuration handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configurable pipelines to process HTML data, with options for deep or fast processing modes. Configuration files are read from local assets, and no external network activity, file writes, or system commands are present. The functions handle input parameters securely, and no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate for HTML processing tasks with configurable pipelines. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected based on the provided code.",
