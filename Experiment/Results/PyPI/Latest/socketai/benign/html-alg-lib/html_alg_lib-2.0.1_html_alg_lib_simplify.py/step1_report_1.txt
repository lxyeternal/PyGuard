{
  "purpose": "The code processes HTML strings through configurable pipelines for labeling, classification, and general simplification, returning processed data or summaries.",
  "sources": "Input HTML string (`html_str`), configuration files (`pipeline_cfg`, obtained from file or data), environment variables (indirectly via `os.path` for config paths).",
  "sinks": "Returns dictionaries or strings containing processed HTML data, including 'alg' and normalized records; no direct data sinks like network or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "HTML input -> read configuration -> configure pipeline -> apply pipeline to HTML -> output processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or obfuscation detected. The code dynamically reads configurations and applies pipelines, but this is standard practice. No suspicious behavior or hidden backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for processing HTML data with configurable pipelines, loading configuration files from a static assets directory, and applying transformations. Usage of `copy.deepcopy` and `Pipeline.from_cfg` indicates modular, standard data processing. No code injections, network operations, or malicious data handling observed. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. Functions return processed data in straightforward manners, primarily dictionaries or strings. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on data processing with external configs and pipeline application, which is standard in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of configurable HTML processing pipelines with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It performs data transformations and returns results without suspicious side-effects. No security threats identified.",
