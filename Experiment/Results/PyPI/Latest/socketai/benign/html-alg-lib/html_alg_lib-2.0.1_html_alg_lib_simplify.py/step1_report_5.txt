{
  "purpose": "The code processes HTML content by applying various pipeline configurations for simplification and labeling, returning processed data in different formats.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, read_cfg, pipeline.apply_to_html, and the function arguments (html_str, pipeline_cfg)",
  "sinks": "Returned data structures, variable assignments, and potential usage of the processed data",
  "flows": "Input html_str is processed through pipeline.apply_to_html; configuration data is read from files or passed directly; the results are returned or further processed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual data flows or suspicious operations observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and specific modules for configuration reading and HTML processing. It defines functions for applying configurations to HTML content, with optional fast modes that remove intermediate records to optimize performance. The functions read configuration files or accept configurations directly, then instantiate a pipeline object and apply it to the input HTML. The results are returned in structured dictionaries or strings. No suspicious or malicious code constructs, no network operations, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of 'os.path', 'copy', and configuration reading is standard. The code appears to perform typical data processing tasks with no signs of malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of HTML processing pipelines with configurable options. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this code segment.",
