{
  "purpose": "The code extracts features from HTML documents for further analysis, specifically targeting nodes based on XPath and attributes, and converts HTML to text for feature representation.",
  "sources": "Input HTML strings or HtmlElement objects from function arguments, and attribute values such as 'cc-alg-node-idxs' and '_item_id'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'xpath' method, 'getroot' and 'getpath' for XPath computations, and writes feature data to a JSON file.",
  "flows": "HTML input → parse to HtmlElement → identify nodes via attributes and XPath → extract text and attributes → build feature dicts → dump to JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity; code appears standard for feature extraction. No obfuscated code detected. The code performs deep copying of HTML elements, which is resource-intensive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs structured HTML parsing, subtree pruning, and feature extraction. It uses standard libraries and methods, with input validation and error handling. The only potentially risky operation is writing output to a file, but it is a common practice and not inherently malicious. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not include any suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard feature extraction utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate feature extraction tool for HTML documents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious operations are evident.",
