{
  "purpose": "The code extracts node-level features from HTML documents, including text, tags, xpaths, class traces, and ID traces, for use in an algorithmic HTML analysis framework.",
  "sources": "HTML content loaded from string inputs or file reads; XPath queries on HTML elements; attribute access on HTML nodes; item_id_map for node ID mappings.",
  "sinks": "Returning feature dictionaries; raising exceptions; file writing for JSON output.",
  "flows": "Input HTML strings → parsing to HtmlElement objects → XPath querying and attribute extraction → feature construction → JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of deep copy and HTML parsing is standard. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present. Exception handling is standard. The code performs feature extraction with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a structured extraction of HTML features, involving deep copying of HTML trees, XPath queries, and attribute collection. It includes tree pruning based on specified XPath lists, which is a standard technique for isolating parts of an HTML DOM. The feature extraction logic uses attribute mappings and constructs feature dictionaries, with no dangerous code injections, network operations, or privacy-invasive actions. The file I/O operation at the end is for saving features to a JSON file, which is typical. All code operations are within normal bounds of a data processing pipeline. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malware-like behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe, structured HTML feature extractor intended for use in a larger analysis framework. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within the scope of this module.",
