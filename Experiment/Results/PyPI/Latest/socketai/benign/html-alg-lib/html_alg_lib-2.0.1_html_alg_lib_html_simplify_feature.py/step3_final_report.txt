{
  "purpose": "The code extracts node-level features from HTML documents, including text, tags, XPath, class and ID traces, for use in machine learning or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "HTML nodes during parsing and iteration, specifically nodes with certain attributes (e.g., 'cc-alg-node-idxs', '_item_id') and their ancestors for class and ID traces.",
  "sinks": "XPath queries on pre_normalized HTML to locate nodes; attribute access for node identifiers; traversal for class and ID traces.",
  "flows": "From node attributes (node_idx, alg_idx) to XPath location, then upward traversal for class/id traces, and finally to feature construction including text extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual operations detected; deep copying of HTML trees is resource-intensive but not malicious; no network activity or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML parsing, XPath querying, tree pruning, and feature extraction. It uses common libraries and practices without obfuscation or malicious payloads. The deep copy of HTML elements is resource-heavy but benign. No signs of malicious intent such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors are present. The attribute handling and traversal are typical for such tasks. The error handling and validation steps are appropriate. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility for feature extraction from HTML documents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTML feature extraction utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
