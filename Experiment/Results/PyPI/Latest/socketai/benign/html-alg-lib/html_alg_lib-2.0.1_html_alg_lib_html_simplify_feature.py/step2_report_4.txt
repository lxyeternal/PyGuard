  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code performs structured HTML parsing, feature extraction, and tree pruning.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code uses standard libraries (lxml, html_alg_lib) and typical processing patterns.\n- The only operations that could be considered sensitive are file I/O and deep copying of HTML trees, which are common in data processing pipelines.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Standard feature extraction.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low), reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed validation.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, still low.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same general pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Standard feature extraction.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, low.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to previous reports.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a legitimate HTML feature extraction utility.\n- No suspicious or malicious operations are present.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the reports.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — low, reflecting standard data processing operations.\n\n**Note:** The current scores are reasonable and align with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical data processing concerns.",
