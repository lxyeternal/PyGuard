{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract node-level features from HTML documents, particularly for use in a neural network or algorithmic processing pipeline, by processing normalized and readable HTML structures and mapping node attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML strings (pre_normalized_html, label_alg_readable_html), XPath queries, and node attributes such as 'cc-alg-node-idxs' and '_item_id'. It also reads from the item_id_map and external HTML files.",
  "sinks": "Uses XPath to locate nodes and extracts text, class, and ID attributes; writes the final feature list to a JSON file.",
  "flows": "HTML input strings are parsed into DOM trees -> XPath queries locate nodes -> node attributes and text are extracted -> the prune_tree_by_xpath_list function trims the tree based on XPath list -> features are assembled -> output written to a JSON file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard HTML parsing, XPath querying, and data extraction. The prune_tree_by_xpath_list function deep-copies trees and manipulates DOM nodes in a typical manner. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code appears.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries like lxml for HTML parsing and XPath operations, with functions for pruning trees and extracting node features. It relies on attribute mappings to correlate nodes across different HTML structures. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, network communications, or malicious behavior. All operations are focused on data extraction and transformation. Error handling is present for missing or inconsistent node attributes. The code includes a test case that reads an HTML file, processes it, and writes JSON output, which is typical for feature extraction pipelines. No signs of malware or malicious side effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate feature extraction from HTML structures for analysis or machine learning purposes. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no security risks beyond standard data handling. Overall, it appears to be a safe, well-structured utility for HTML feature extraction.",
