  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code extracts features from HTML, no malicious activity, standard parsing, deep copying for tree manipulation, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is a straightforward feature extractor, involving parsing, XPath, attribute collection, and JSON output.\n  - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n  - Deep copying HTML trees is resource-intensive but not malicious.\n  - No suspicious network activity or code injection.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, given no malicious activity)\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing structured HTML parsing, XPath, attribute extraction, no malicious signs.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or network activity.\n  - Uses standard libraries and techniques.\n  - Deep copying is resource-heavy but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (still low, acceptable)\n  - Confidence: 0.95 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard HTML feature extraction, tree pruning, attribute mapping, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n  - Tree pruning and XPath querying are standard procedures.\n  - No network activity or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on structured HTML processing, feature extraction, no malicious signs, standard libraries.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n  - Uses deep copying and XPath, typical for such tasks.\n  - No obfuscation or network activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, justified)\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar feature extraction process, tree pruning, attribute mapping, no malicious signs.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n  - Operations are standard for HTML processing.\n  - No network activity or code injection.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's operations—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, justified by detailed reasoning.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, **all reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior**. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard data processing.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, standard data processing risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a legitimate HTML feature extraction utility with no security concerns.",
