  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code performs HTML parsing, tree pruning, feature extraction, and output to JSON.\n- No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (lxml, html_alg_lib).\n- Error handling and validation are implemented.\n- The main operations are data processing tasks typical in web scraping or HTML analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Extracts features from HTML for analysis.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly states that the code is a standard feature extractor.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- The deep copy of HTML trees is resource-intensive but not malicious.\n- The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the operations.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Extract node-level features, including XPath, attributes, etc.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis emphasizes that the code is standard, with no network activity or malicious intent.\n- Tree pruning and attribute extraction are common tasks.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly high, but considering potential risks of handling untrusted HTML (e.g., large resource consumption or potential for malicious HTML structures), it is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Extract features for web scraping/analysis, focusing on simplified HTML.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report notes that the code is a legitimate feature extractor.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- Tree pruning and attribute handling are standard.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Extract features for ML models, processing normalized/readable HTML.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis confirms that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- Operations are typical for data preprocessing.\n- The low malware score aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are suitable.** No modifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Extract features from normalized and readable HTML, including XPath and attribute mapping.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The report correctly states that the code performs standard HTML processing.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Tree pruning and feature extraction are typical.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified.** No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal potential concerns due to resource usage or handling untrusted HTML, but overall low.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured HTML feature extraction utility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to resource considerations and handling untrusted input)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
