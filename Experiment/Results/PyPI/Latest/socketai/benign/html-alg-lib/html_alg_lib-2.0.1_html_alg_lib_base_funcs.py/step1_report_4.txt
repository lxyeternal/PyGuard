{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and parse HTML files, extract the title, and perform text-based calculations on the HTML content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a file specified by 'file_path' in the 'read_html_file' function; uses external libraries 'chardet', 'lxml', and custom modules 'html_alg_lib.html_simplify'.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions appear to output untrusted data or interact with external systems directly. The 'read_html_file' function reads and decodes file content but does not send or process it further for external communication.",
  "flows": "Input file data flows through reading and decoding steps, with potential JSON parsing. No evident data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External libraries are used normally for parsing and HTML manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML reading and parsing tasks. 'read_html_file' reads file bytes, detects encoding, decodes, and optionally parses JSON. 'get_title' extracts the title using XPath. 'calc_tree_without_tags_length' converts HTML to text and measures length. 'calc_leaf_nodes' recursively counts leaf nodes. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration appears present. Use of external libraries is typical for HTML processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical HTML parsing utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. All operations are benign and intended for content analysis.",
