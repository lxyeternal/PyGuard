{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'html_alg_lib' Python library, including reading dependencies from external files and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading dependency files ('req/core.txt', 'req/full.txt'), reading 'readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "The open() function is used for reading files; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: get_req() reads dependency files; sink: open('readme.md').read(); flow from source to sink is reading static files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden functions observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: defining a function to read requirements, loading dependencies from files, setting package metadata, and reading a README file for long description. All operations are straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It safely reads dependencies and package metadata, presenting no evidence of malicious behavior.",
