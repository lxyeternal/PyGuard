  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. External file dependencies do not pose a security threat unless compromised externally. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The minimal risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the context."
