{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'html_alg_lib', responsible for defining package metadata, dependencies, and data inclusion for distribution.",
  "sources": "The script reads dependency lists from 'req/core.txt' and 'req/full.txt', and reads the long description from 'readme.md'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive functions or exported beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "Input files ('req/core.txt', 'req/full.txt', and 'readme.md') are read to gather dependencies and description; no untrusted data is processed into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard setup operations without obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary functions from setuptools, defines a function to read dependencies from specified files, and then uses these dependencies in the setup() call. It reads package description from a Markdown file. All operations are typical for package setup and do not involve dynamic code execution, external network calls, or handling of untrusted user input. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly reads dependency files and package metadata without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data insecurely.",
