  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'html_alg_lib' Python library, including dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading dependencies from 'req/core.txt' and 'req/full.txt'; reading 'readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input from dependency files and README flows into the setup configuration; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to read requirements from files, then configures setup parameters including package data, dependencies, and metadata. No suspicious code behavior, dynamic code execution, or external data transmission observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
