  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, reading dependencies and metadata from external files.",
  "sources": "Reads dependency lists from 'req/core.txt' and 'req/full.txt', and reads 'readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; no network or code injection occurs.",
  "flows": "External files are read directly without processing untrusted input; no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script using setuptools. It reads dependencies and description files without any processing that could introduce security issues. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified due to reliance on external files, which is standard practice and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. External file dependencies do not pose a security threat unless compromised externally. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The minimal risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the context.",
