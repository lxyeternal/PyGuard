{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and configure a Python package named 'html_alg_lib', specifying its dependencies, package data, and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the dependencies from external text files ('req/core.txt' and 'req/full.txt') and the long description from 'readme.md'.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes package metadata and dependencies, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "External files are read to obtain dependencies and description content, which are then passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code reads external files straightforwardly and uses standard setup tools without any dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to parse requirement files, loads dependencies for core and full requirements, and calls setuptools.setup() to configure the package. It reads external files for dependencies and description, which is standard practice. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The package metadata appears legitimate and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It responsibly loads dependencies and metadata without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
