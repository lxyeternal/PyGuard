  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'html_alg_lib' with specified dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading dependency files ('req/core.txt', 'req/full.txt') and 'readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data is directly used in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Input from dependency files flows into install_requires and extras_require; readme content flows into long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads dependency lists from external files and a markdown readme for package setup. No code execution of untrusted data or suspicious behavior is present. Usage of standard setup tools and reading files for metadata is typical for Python package setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
