{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to interact with OpenAI and Aliyun APIs to process HTML content, generate prompts for annotation tasks, and parse responses, primarily for analyzing HTML elements and their functions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('GPT_KEY_FILE', 'ALI_KEY_FILE'), reads API keys from files, reads HTML code from input files, and receives prompts and responses from API calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses API calls via 'requests' and 'aiohttp' for sending prompts and receiving data. Reads API keys from local files. Outputs JSON parsed data from API responses.",
  "flows": "API keys are read from files based on environment variables (source). Prompts are constructed and sent to external APIs (sink). Responses are parsed and returned (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code straightforwardly interacts with external APIs. No hardcoded credentials are present; API keys are read from external files. No malicious or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads API keys from environment-specified files, avoiding hardcoded secrets. API interactions are performed via standard HTTP requests and SDK calls with clear separation of concerns. The functions for parsing JSON and removing comments do not contain malicious behavior. The code mainly orchestrates API calls, prompt generation, and response parsing. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise are present. The overall structure and flow suggest legitimate API interaction and data processing for content annotation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate tool for processing HTML annotations and content analysis via external APIs. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or security flaws was found.",
