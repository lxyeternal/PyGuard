{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for interacting with AI APIs (Claudeshop and AliCloud), handling API keys, constructing prompts, parsing JSON responses, and analyzing HTML content for annotation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading API keys from environment variables or files, input prompts, HTML content for analysis.",
  "sinks": "API request functions sending data over network, JSON response parsing, prompt generation.",
  "flows": "Source: API keys and input prompts; Sink: API request/response; Flow: Key reading → API call → JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation detected; API keys are read from files/env vars without encryption; debug print statements in JSON parsing could leak info; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing API clients for AI services with prompt and JSON handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. API keys are stored externally, which is standard but could be improved for security. JSON parsing includes fallback mechanisms, but nothing malicious. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client and HTML annotation utility with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns about secret handling practices but does not indicate malicious intent.",
