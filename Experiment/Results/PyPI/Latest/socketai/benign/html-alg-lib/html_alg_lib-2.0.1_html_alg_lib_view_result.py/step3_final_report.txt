{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for HTML content extraction, text scoring, label management, and HTML pruning, primarily for content analysis and processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML strings, extracts text via BeautifulSoup, and processes labels and node IDs internally; no external data sources or untrusted input handling explicitly noted.",
  "sinks": "No external network, file, or system modifications; operations are confined to in-memory processing and data transformation.",
  "flows": "HTML input -> parse and extract content -> prune DOM based on labels -> generate HTML snippets and text content -> compute ROUGE scores; no external communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected; straightforward use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTML parsing, text tokenization, label-based DOM pruning, and scoring functions. It uses well-known open-source libraries such as BeautifulSoup, jieba, ltp, and rouge_score. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The functions are utility-focused, with clear logic and no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for content extraction, HTML manipulation, and scoring. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to the nature of operations but no actual vulnerabilities.",
