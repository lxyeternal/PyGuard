{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing HTML content, calculating ROUGE scores, and manipulating labeled HTML structures, likely for content analysis or extraction tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input HTML strings from function arguments; it also accesses the 'target' and 'prediction' text inputs for score calculation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involve untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; the code manipulates and outputs HTML and text content but does not perform network or system operations.",
  "flows": "Input HTML and text data flow into parsing and scoring functions; labeled data flows into HTML pruning functions; processed HTML is output as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic are present. Usage of well-known libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of standard parsing, string manipulation, and scoring functions. It utilizes common libraries (BeautifulSoup, jieba, etc.) for content processing. Functions for pruning HTML and merging labels perform straightforward operations without external or malicious dependencies. No network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No anomalies such as backdoors, covert data handling, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for HTML content analysis and scoring tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. All functions operate within expected parameters, and no malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
