{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for HTML content processing, text extraction, scoring, and label mapping, primarily used for document analysis or comparison tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments: target and prediction texts, HTML strings, label and item ID mappings, and HTML elements obtained through parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are apparent; functions perform data processing without external communications or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through text splitting, tokenization, scoring calculations, HTML parsing, label merging, and pruning functions, with no evidence of untrusted data affecting system commands or sensitive data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code relies on third-party libraries but does not perform any suspicious operations with them. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The only minor point is deep copying and handling of HTML elements, which are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text scoring using ROUGE metrics with sentence splitting and tokenization, HTML content extraction, and HTML pruning based on label mappings. All functions operate on input data, perform parsing, and manipulate HTML trees with standard libraries. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of third-party libraries like jieba, BeautifulSoup, and lxml is typical for text and HTML processing, and no malicious patterns are present. The functions are read-only regarding external resources, with no external communication or sensitive data handling beyond the provided inputs. Overall, the code appears benign and solely focused on document analysis and processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, performing typical text and HTML processing tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or security risks. The logic is straightforward, and no malicious activities are detected.",
