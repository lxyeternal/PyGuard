{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for HTML content extraction, text similarity scoring, and HTML element pruning based on node labels and indices. It appears to be used for content analysis and processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input HTML strings in 'get_content_text', 'extract_with_label', and indirectly via imported libraries like BeautifulSoup and lxml. It also reads target and prediction texts in 'get_score' and 'rouge_eval'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands. It processes HTML and text data but does not perform actions that could leak or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Input HTML and text data are processed through parsing functions, with no flow leading to external data transmission or side effects. The only potential concern is reading input and processing it internally without unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs standard libraries and conventional processing patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs HTML parsing, text segmentation, and similarity scoring using established libraries (BeautifulSoup, jieba, ltp, etc.). Functions like 'get_content_text' and 'extract_with_label' handle content extraction and pruning without modifying system state or performing network operations. No use of insecure coding practices or malicious logic is detected. The code focuses on content analysis and manipulation without engaging in activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard content processing utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs HTML and text analysis safely without engaging in dangerous operations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the code itself.",
