{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for processing HTML content, calculating ROUGE scores for text similarity, and managing labeled node structures within HTML trees, likely for content analysis or comparison tasks.",
  "sources": "Inputs include HTML strings, text data for scoring, and dictionaries mapping node IDs and labels. No direct external data sources or untrusted input handling are explicitly evident.",
  "sinks": "The code performs HTML parsing and manipulation, but does not write to files, execute system commands, or perform network operations. No data is sent externally or stored unsafely.",
  "flows": "HTML content is parsed and transformed into text or modified DOM structures; text inputs are tokenized and scored; mappings between node IDs and labels are merged and processed for HTML pruning. No suspicious data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code contains standard libraries for text processing, HTML parsing, and DOM manipulation. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses common libraries for HTML and text processing, performing safe operations such as deep copying, pruning DOM trees, and extracting content. The scoring functions rely on standard scoring methods, and label management is straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system disruption mechanisms is present. The functions operate within the expected scope of content analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility set for HTML content processing and ROUGE-based text similarity scoring, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly handles data parsing, manipulation, and scoring without external communications or harmful operations.",
