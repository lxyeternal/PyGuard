{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility, potentially for network operations or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or data received over the network.",
  "sinks": "File writes, network transmissions, system commands, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data from sources passes through various processing functions and may reach sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code not present. No suspicious domain or IP usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common malicious patterns. It uses standard library functions and common third-party modules. No suspicious network activity, credential theft, or unauthorized data exfiltration observed. The code structure appears typical for a utility script, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The absence of hard-coded secrets or unexplained code paths suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no indication of malware or malicious activity. However, full confidence requires testing in the operational environment.",
