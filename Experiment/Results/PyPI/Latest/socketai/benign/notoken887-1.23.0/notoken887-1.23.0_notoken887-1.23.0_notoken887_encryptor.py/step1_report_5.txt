  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns from encrypt() and decrypt() methods that output transformed strings.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace('M', '∩') and replace('A', '►') -> output encrypted string; encrypted string -> reverse replacements -> decrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of character replacements as encryption is very weak and not secure; no external data sources or network activity; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys.",
  "analysis": "The class performs character substitution for 'M' and 'A' with symbols '∩' and '►'. This pattern is simple and does not involve any external data input or network communication. The methods only perform string replacements, which are not security-sensitive operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks present. The code appears to be a trivial obfuscation or encoding mechanism, not malware or a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character substitution scheme with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any harmful operations or leak data. It is a very simple and insecure 'encryption' method, but not malicious.",
