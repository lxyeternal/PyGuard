  "purpose": "Simple reversible character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in encrypt() and decrypt() methods; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters ('M'/'A') -> output encrypted string; encrypted string -> reverse replacements -> decrypted output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward character replacements with no external dependencies or obfuscation beyond simple substitution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic character replacements for 'M' and 'A' with no external dependencies, no malicious code, and no obfuscation beyond trivial substitution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low obfuscation scores (around 0.1-0.2). The security risk scores are appropriately minimal, reflecting the lack of security-sensitive operations. The logic is clear, reversible, and does not pose security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with trivial obfuscation and no malicious behavior. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
