  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens by replacing specific characters",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt and decrypt methods",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the processed strings",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters -> output encrypted/decrypted string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscation, no external data sources or sinks",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two straightforward methods that perform character replacements. There are no external data reads, no network connections, no environment variable usage, and no suspicious logic. The replacement operations are simple and do not involve dynamic code execution or data leakage. The design appears to be a minimal obfuscation mechanism, not malware. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic character substitution cipher with no evidence of malicious behavior. It functions solely to transform input strings in a reversible manner, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
