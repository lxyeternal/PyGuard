  "purpose": "The class provides simple obfuscation methods for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the encrypt and decrypt methods.",
  "sinks": "The return statements output the transformed strings; no external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace 'M' with '∩' and 'A' with '►' in encrypt -> output encrypted string -> decrypt reverses replacements -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption is very simplistic and does not provide real security; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. No external network calls, environment variable usage, or code injection present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: encrypt and decrypt. Both methods perform character replacements, effectively obfuscating the string but not securing it. There are no suspicious imports, no data leakage, no backdoors, and no malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and purely string manipulation. No signs of malware, code injection, or security risks are evident. The simplicity suggests this is a lightweight obfuscation technique rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. It is a simple character replacement obfuscation tool with no security or malware risks. The implementation is benign and does not compromise security.",
