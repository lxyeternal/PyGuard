{
  "purpose": "A simple class for encrypting and decrypting tokens by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the processed strings; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters -> output string; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond string replacement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The replacement is straightforward and does not involve external network, file I/O, or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'. Each method performs character replacement operations to obfuscate or restore certain characters. The operations are simple string replacements without external dependencies or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The methods are purely functional for basic character substitution, which does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign simple character substitution cipher implementation. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The class could serve as a basic obfuscation tool without security guarantees but does not present security concerns or malware behavior.",
