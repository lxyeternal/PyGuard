  "purpose": "The class provides simple methods for encrypting and decrypting strings by replacing specific characters.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods.",
  "sinks": "Output strings returned by 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' method -> replaced string -> output; input string -> 'decrypt' method -> replaced string -> output.",
  "anomalies": "The encryption scheme is simplistic and reversible, offering no security. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. No external data access or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods that perform straightforward character replacements for obfuscation. The encryption replaces 'M' with '∩' and 'A' with '►'. The decryption reverses this process. There are no external data inputs, no use of environment variables, and no code injection or malicious logic. The approach is purely reversible string substitution, which does not provide security but also does not pose a malicious threat. The code is simple, clear, and lacks any suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic reversible character substitution with no malicious intent or security risks. It is not obfuscated malicious code but merely a trivial encoding scheme. No malware or security issues detected.",
