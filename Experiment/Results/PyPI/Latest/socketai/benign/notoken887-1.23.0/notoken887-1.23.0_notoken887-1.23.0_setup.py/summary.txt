  "conclusion": "The setup script is technically safe and free of malicious code. The only concern is the suspicious contact info and URL, which could be leveraged for social engineering but do not represent a technical security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2) reflecting metadata suspicion without technical maliciousness."
