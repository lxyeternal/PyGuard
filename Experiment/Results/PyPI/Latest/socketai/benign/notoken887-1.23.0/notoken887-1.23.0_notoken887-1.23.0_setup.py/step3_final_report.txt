  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within setup() call: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data assigned directly to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') as unprofessional and provocative metadata; no code-based anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic code, external input, or code execution exists. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact info and URL, which could be used for social engineering but do not constitute malicious code. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately set to 0. The security risk score, based on metadata suspicion, is moderate (~0.2-0.3). Given the lack of technical threats, the overall risk is low. The code's structure and content are benign, with the main concern being reputational or social engineering risk due to metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is technically safe and free of malicious code. The only concern is the suspicious contact info and URL, which could be leveraged for social engineering but do not represent a technical security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2) reflecting metadata suspicion without technical maliciousness.",
