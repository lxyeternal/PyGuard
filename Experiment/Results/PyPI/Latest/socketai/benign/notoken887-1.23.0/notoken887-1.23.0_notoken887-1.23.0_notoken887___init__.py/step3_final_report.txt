  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution points, variable assignments, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, eval/exec calls, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or eval/exec leading to sinks like network transmission, file modification, or environment access.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (eval, exec, unusual variable names), dynamic code generation, hardcoded secrets, absence of code (empty files).",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify code content and assign scores consistent with observed features. Report 2's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution is justified, but malware suspicion could be slightly lowered due to lack of confirmed malicious payloads. Benign reports are straightforward, with scores matching their descriptions. Minor score adjustments recommended for Report 2: reduce malware from 0.3 to ~0.2, keep obfuscated at 0.7, and risk at 0.45. Overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate; the primary adjustment involves slightly lowering the malware score in Report 2 to better reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity while maintaining suspicion due to obfuscation signs. All other reports are aligned with their content.",
