  "purpose": "A simple Python server managing socket connections and serving static files, with periodic message broadcasting.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('json.js', 'follower.html'), socket.receive(), socket.getpeername()",
  "sinks": "socket.send(), print statements for logging",
  "flows": "socket.receive() → assert message is None; socket.send() in send(); static file read and served",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' to detect socket closure; traceback printed on exceptions; static file serving without input validation",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a basic server that manages WebSocket-like connections, serving static files and broadcasting messages periodically. No dynamic code execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration are present. The 'assert message is None' pattern is a common way to detect socket closure, not malicious. Traceback leakage is a minor security concern but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity detected. The static file serving is limited to known files, minimizing injection risk. Overall, the code appears benign with minor security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign server implementation with no signs of malicious activity, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, primarily due to minor issues like traceback leakage and the assertion pattern, which do not constitute malicious behavior.",
