  "purpose": "To start a Flash policy server that listens for Flash client connections.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and w3socket.policyserver modules; initializing and starting FlashPolicyServer instance.",
  "sinks": "Printing server information to standard error stream.",
  "flows": "Initialization of server -> server.start() -> print statement to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward server startup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes a Flash policy server with 'noisy' output enabled, starts the server, and prints server details to standard error. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of providing Flash client policy files. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The server runs in a blocking call to serve_forever, which is typical for such servers. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server setup for Flash policy delivery with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
