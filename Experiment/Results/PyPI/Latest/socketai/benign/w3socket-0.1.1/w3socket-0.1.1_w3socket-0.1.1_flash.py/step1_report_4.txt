  "purpose": "Start a Flash Policy Server to serve security policies for Flash clients.",
  "sources": "Importing the FlashPolicyServer class from the w3socket.policyserver module; executing server.start() and server.serve_forever() methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output or external connections beyond starting the server.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the server object, starting the server, and entering an infinite loop to serve policies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; straightforward server start-up.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Flash Policy Server using a third-party module. It outputs status information to standard error. There are no user inputs, no external data reads, and no untrusted data flows. The server runs indefinitely, but this is standard for such a service. The module used is a standard component for serving Flash policy files, which is a common practice for supporting Flash clients.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of a Flash Policy Server. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It simply starts a server to serve Flash policies. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks within this code.",
