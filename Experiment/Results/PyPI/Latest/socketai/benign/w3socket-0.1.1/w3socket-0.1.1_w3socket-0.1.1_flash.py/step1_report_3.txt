  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server to allow Flash clients to connect.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module and w3socket.policyserver, instantiating FlashPolicyServer, server.start(), and server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() initiate network services that listen for incoming connections",
  "flows": "Instantiation of FlashPolicyServer -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() listening for connections",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network calls or data exfiltration observed",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a Flash policy server using w3socket.policyserver. It runs indefinitely to serve policy requests, which is typical for such servers. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior. It merely sets up and runs a service that is intended to allow Flash clients to connect, consistent with its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a standard purpose of providing a Flash policy server. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
