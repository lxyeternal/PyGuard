  "purpose": "To start a Flash policy server for handling Flash socket policy requests.",
  "sources": "Import from w3socket.policyserver, initialization of FlashPolicyServer, server.start(), server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; server operations are standard for a policy server, no data sinks with untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Initialization of the server, starting the server, serving forever without external data processing or output manipulation",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code uses standard library functions, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The script imports a Flash policy server class, creates an instance, starts it, and logs the server address to standard error. It appears to be a standard setup for a Flash socket policy server with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The use of the server is limited to listening for policy requests, with no external network data manipulation or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a Flash socket policy server with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
