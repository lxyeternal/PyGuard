  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for W3socket to allow cross-domain access in Flash applications.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and w3socket.policyserver, initializing FlashPolicyServer instance.",
  "sinks": "Printing server address to standard error, server.start(), server.serve_forever()",
  "flows": "Initialization of server -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() -> logging output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no data leakage or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library 'sys' and a specific module 'w3socket.policyserver'. It creates an instance of FlashPolicyServer with 'noisy=True' and starts it. It then outputs the server's host and port to standard error, and runs an infinite serve loop. The code is straightforward, intended for hosting a Flash policy server. No external data input, no untrusted data processing, no suspicious network activity observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple server initializer for a Flash policy server, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected actions without suspicious behavior.",
