  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a custom WebSocket draft protocol with no malicious intent or behavior. The low malware score (0) is justified. The code is clear and not obfuscated, so obfuscated score (0) is appropriate. The overall security risk is low (0.2), primarily due to protocol security considerations, not malicious activity. The code does not pose a significant security threat but has inherent protocol security weaknesses."
