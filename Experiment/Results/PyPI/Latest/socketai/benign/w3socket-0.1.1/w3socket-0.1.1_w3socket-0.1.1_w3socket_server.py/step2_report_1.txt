  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes the broad exception handling but considers it typical for debugging. No significant logical flaws are identified.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable given the broad exception handling but overall low risk.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, a low risk score is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code manages socket and file operations normally, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The report notes broad exception handling and the use of 'IOError' syntax (Python 2 style). These are standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified, given the exception handling practices.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  No evidence of malicious behavior; low risk is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical server setup with no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The broad exception handling is noted but considered standard.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - malware: 0 — suitable.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — suitable.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  No malicious activity; low risk is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code appears legitimate, serving static files and managing WebSocket connections.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Broad exception handling is noted but is typical for server code.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code performs standard server functions with no malicious signs.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Similar to others, broad exception handling is noted but not suspicious.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.2), justified by the standard exception handling and typical server logic, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal risk, mainly due to broad exception handling, which is common in server code but not malicious.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the current assessments. The code appears to be a legitimate server implementation with no supply chain security issues evident from the provided reports.",
