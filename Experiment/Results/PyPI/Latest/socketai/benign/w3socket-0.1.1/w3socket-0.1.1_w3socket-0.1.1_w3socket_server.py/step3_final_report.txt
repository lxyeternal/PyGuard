{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WSGI server with WebSocket and Flash policy support, serving static files and managing socket connections.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem files (via open), socket objects, and request headers.",
  "sinks": "File reads for static content, setting response headers, logging messages, socket management, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and request data flow into file serving and socket handling; static files are served based on request paths; logs are generated; socket states are managed during request handling.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling ('except:'), serving files without input validation, and Python 2 syntax ('except IOError, ex'), but no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard server functions: static file serving, WebSocket management, environment variable access, and logging. No signs of malicious activity such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Exception handling is broad but typical for server code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network connections are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to general exception handling practices, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard server implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are 0. The current assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
