  "purpose": "Serve a cross-domain policy file for Flash clients to enable cross-origin socket connections.",
  "sources": "The socket object in the handle method, which reads connection data (though not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "The socket.sendall(self.policy) method, which sends the policy XML to clients.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> handle() method -> socket.sendall() with policy XML.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It simply serves a static XML policy.",
  "analysis": "The code extends gevent's StreamServer to serve a fixed cross-domain policy XML for Flash clients. It initializes with default listener on port 843, which is standard for such policies. The handle method optionally logs accepted connections and sends a static policy string. No user input, untrusted data, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and conventional for this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a legitimate function related to Flash cross-domain policy serving, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
