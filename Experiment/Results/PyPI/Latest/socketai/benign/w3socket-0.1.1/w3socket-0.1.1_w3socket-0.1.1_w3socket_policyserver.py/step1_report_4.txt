  "purpose": "To serve a Cross-Domain Policy XML for Flash clients connecting on port 843.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming socket connections and client addresses in the handle method.",
  "sinks": "Sends the policy XML data over the socket connection.",
  "flows": "Accepts a connection (source), then sends the static XML policy data (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; the policy is a standard Flash cross-domain policy.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server for serving a cross-domain policy XML for Flash applications. It listens on port 843 and responds with a fixed policy XML. The class inherits from gevent's StreamServer, and the handle method simply sends a static policy string. The code appears straightforward and standard for this purpose. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. No external data sources or insecure operations are present. The server's behavior is to respond with a fixed policy, which is common for Flash server configurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
