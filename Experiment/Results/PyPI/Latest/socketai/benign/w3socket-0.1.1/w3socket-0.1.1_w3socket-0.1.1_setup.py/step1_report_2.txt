{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'w3socket' Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ from 'w3socket/__init__.py' to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the setup function calls do not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file and passes static data to setup(), with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info from a file, which is standard but should handle potential file read errors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution. It imports standard libraries, attempts to import setuptools with fallback to distutils, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with static parameters. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.",
