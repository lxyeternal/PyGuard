{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'w3socket' for distribution, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'w3socket/__init__.py'. It also reads the file during version extraction.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not include any direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the source file and used in package setup; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic extraction of the version from '__init__.py' is common but can be manipulated if the file is compromised. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present. The list of dependencies includes 'pyinstaller', which is a legitimate build tool but also can be used maliciously if misused, though its presence alone is not suspicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks: importing modules, extracting version info, and calling 'setup()' with metadata and dependencies. The version extraction uses regex to parse the version string from a source file, which is standard practice. The dependencies are all publicly available Python packages; no malicious dependencies or code are evident. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code does not interact with untrusted input, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging and distribution. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
