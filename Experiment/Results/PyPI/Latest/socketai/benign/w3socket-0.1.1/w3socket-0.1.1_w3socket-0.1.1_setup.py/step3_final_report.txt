  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for w3socket, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'w3socket/__init__.py' via regex; imports setup functions; lists dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or code execution; only package configuration.",
  "flows": "Version info source (file read) → regex extraction → setup configuration; dependencies listed for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; regex for version extraction is standard but could be manipulated if source is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. It imports setup functions, extracts version info via regex, and specifies dependencies. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. Dependencies like 'pyinstaller' and 'web3node' are common in packaging contexts. The regex-based version extraction, while potentially manipulable if the source file is compromised, is a standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the dependency list but not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the script is benign and aligns with typical package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The dependency list and version extraction method are typical for such scripts. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
