  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a typical setup script; no suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious dependencies. The only notable point is the use of regex for version extraction, which is standard.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident risks.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully legitimate, standard package setup code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script, version read via regex, dependencies are normal. Slight mention of 'pyinstaller' which can be misused but is not suspicious here.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.1 — a very low score, possibly reflecting the presence of build tools like 'pyinstaller', but not malicious.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, likely just noting potential misuse of build tools.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; just a typical setup script with a minor note on dependencies.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious behavior, no external data sources, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with standard setup scripts.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Assessment:** Legitimate, standard package configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup script, version extraction via regex, dependencies listed, no suspicious code or network activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly due to inclusion of packages like 'pyinstaller' and 'web3node' which can be sensitive, but their presence alone isn't malicious.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; just standard setup code with dependencies that could be used in security-sensitive contexts.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as previous; standard setup script, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks identified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard Python setup script.  \n- **Malware Risk:** All scores are 0 or near 0, indicating no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Code:** All are 0, confirming code clarity.  \n- **Security Risks:** Very low, mostly due to the nature of the script, which is just packaging configuration.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script.  \n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code features are present.  \n- The dependencies are standard, with some potentially sensitive packages (like 'pyinstaller' and 'web3node') that are common in certain contexts but not inherently malicious.  \n- The regex-based version extraction is common practice, though it can be manipulated if the source file is compromised, but this is a known and accepted pattern.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting the potential misuse of dependencies but not an actual risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe package setup script is benign and standard. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present based on the code and reports provided.",
