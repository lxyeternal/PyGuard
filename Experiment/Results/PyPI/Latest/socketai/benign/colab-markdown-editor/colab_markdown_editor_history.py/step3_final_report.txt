  "sinks": "Display of recent snapshots using ipywidgets.HTML and VBox.",
  "flows": "Text input -> record() stores (timestamp, text) -> widget() generates HTML snippets for recent entries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data fetching detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class that logs timestamped text entries and displays recent snapshots using ipywidgets. It uses standard libraries without any obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no external network calls, code injection, or sensitive data handling. The data flow is simple and internal, with sanitized HTML output. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a simple UI component for history logging. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
