{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal package-level docstring indicating the package name 'markdown_editor'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the static string comment (docstring).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist as the code contains only a comment with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a simple placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable package description with only a docstring. No input/output, data processing, or malicious patterns are evident. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. Confidence levels are high, except for a slightly lower confidence in some reports due to minimal content, but this does not affect the overall benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a package comment. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
