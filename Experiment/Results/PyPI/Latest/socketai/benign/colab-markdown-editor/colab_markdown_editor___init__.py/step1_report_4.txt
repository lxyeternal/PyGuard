  "sources": "No input or data sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No output functions or sinks are present; no untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are detectable due to the minimal code provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment indicating the package name; no executable code, imports, or logic is present. This is unusual for a functional package and may suggest an incomplete snippet or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a package docstring or comment with no functional or security-relevant code. Without actual implementation, there are no security risks, data flows, or malicious behaviors identifiable. The absence of code prevents any in-depth analysis or suspicion beyond the trivial comment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet contains only a package comment and no executable or security-relevant code. Therefore, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
