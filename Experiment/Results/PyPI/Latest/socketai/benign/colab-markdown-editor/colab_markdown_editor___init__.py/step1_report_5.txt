{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a package named 'markdown_editor', likely intended for editing Markdown content.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are evident; no user input, environment variables, or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, system calls, network connections, or other sink functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is minimal and only contains a package docstring.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only a package-level docstring. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to a single comment indicating a package name. There are no functions, classes, or executable statements. This suggests a straightforward package declaration without embedded logic or external interactions. Given the lack of operational code, there are no evident security concerns, malicious behaviors, or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. The code simply declares a package with no active logic or data handling. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
