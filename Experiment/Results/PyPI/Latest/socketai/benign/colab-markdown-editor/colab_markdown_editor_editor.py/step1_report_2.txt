  "purpose": "Provide a markdown text editor widget using ipywidgets for Jupyter Notebook.",
  "sources": "import ipywidgets as widgets; self.area.value in set_text method; self.area.observe in bind method.",
  "sinks": "self.area.value in set_text method; callback in bind method.",
  "flows": "Input text to self.area.value; user interactions trigger observe callback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manages a UI widget without external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple markdown editor class using ipywidgets, with methods to set and get text and bind a callback to text changes. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code patterns. It does not process untrusted data insecurely, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious logic. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended for UI purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a markdown editor widget for Jupyter Notebook. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
