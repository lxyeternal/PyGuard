  "purpose": "Manage markdown files including searching, loading, saving, and mounting Google Drive in Colab environment.",
  "sources": "File system reads (open, os.path.exists, os.walk), user input (file paths), drive mounting condition.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, drive mounting call.",
  "flows": "Path inputs are used in file open/read/write operations and drive mount condition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Usage of Google Colab's drive mount function is standard for Colab environments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file management functions: searching for markdown files, loading and saving file contents, and mounting Google Drive in a Colab environment. All file operations use safe open/read/write with specified encodings. The drive mounting uses the standard Google Colab API without obfuscation or suspicious logic. No input sanitization or validation issues are evident, and there are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of Google Colab's drive module is contextually appropriate and not malicious in itself. Overall, the code appears straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard file management utility tailored for a Colab environment. It performs no malicious activities, does not leak data, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code. No security threats are evident.",
