  "purpose": "File management for markdown files with integration for Google Colab drive mounting.",
  "sources": "File system reads (open, os.walk), drive mount check (os.path.exists), imported _drive.mount()",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, drive mounting action",
  "flows": "User or system input to file paths, file content to variables, drive mounting trigger if path does not exist",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic file management functions: searching for markdown files, loading content, saving content, and mounting Google Drive in Colab. All file operations use safe open/read/write calls with specified encodings. The drive mounting relies on checking the existence of a directory and then calling the external API, which is a standard Colab procedure. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code paths, and no data leaks are evident. The use of the _drive object is legitimate and typical for Colab notebooks. No anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and intended for file management within a Colab environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions operate in a standard, safe manner without suspicious code patterns.",
