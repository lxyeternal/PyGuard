  "purpose": "Provides basic file management operations for markdown files and integrates Google Drive mounting in Colab.",
  "sources": "os.walk for directory traversal, open() for file reading/writing, fnmatch.filter for pattern matching, google.colab.drive.mount for drive mounting.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input paths are used in file operations; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and APIs without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file operations and drive mounting in Colab environment. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of google.colab.drive.mount is environment-specific but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code patterns are present. The functions are simple, with no external or untrusted data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities. The overall design is benign and aligns with typical file management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing markdown files and mounting Google Drive in Colab. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
