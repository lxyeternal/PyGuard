  "purpose": "File management for markdown files in a Colab environment, including searching, loading, saving files, and mounting Google Drive.",
  "sources": "os.walk, fnmatch.filter, open() for reading and writing files, and the google.colab.drive.mount method for mounting Google Drive.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing via open(), mounting drive via google.colab.drive.mount.",
  "flows": "Input paths are passed to load() and save() methods, which read/write files; search() collects file paths; mount_drive() mounts drive if not already mounted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, no unusual code patterns. Usage of google.colab.drive.mount is standard for Colab environments.",
  "analysis": "The script provides basic file management functions: searching for markdown files, loading and saving content, and mounting Google Drive in Colab. All file operations are performed using standard Python functions without untrusted input handling beyond file paths provided to functions. The drive mounting is conditional and standard for Google Colab. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious activities are detected. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or privacy violations are present. The code appears straightforward and aligned with typical file management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard file management utility designed for use within Google Colab. It contains no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic, necessary functions with no suspicious behaviors.",
