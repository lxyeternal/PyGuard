  "purpose": "Render markdown content within a Jupyter Notebook using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'render' method's 'text' argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'render' method displays markdown in the output widget, which is a controlled display element.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from 'render' method to the display output via 'Markdown' rendering within the widget's context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior present. Usage of standard ipywidgets and IPython.display APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for rendering markdown in an interactive widget, with standard methods for initializing, rendering, and retrieving the widget. It uses well-known libraries without any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscated patterns. No data leakage, malicious commands, or backdoors are present. The functions perform simple display logic consistent with their documented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation for displaying markdown content within a Jupyter environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
