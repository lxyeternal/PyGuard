  "sources": "User-provided markdown text passed to the render() method.",
  "sinks": "Markdown rendering output within the IPython display framework.",
  "flows": "Input markdown text -> render() method -> display in Output widget.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses standard IPython and ipywidgets APIs without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for displaying markdown in a Jupyter environment. It initializes an Output widget, clears previous output, and displays new markdown content when render() is called. It uses standard libraries with no external or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical usage patterns for ipywidgets and IPython.display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for markdown rendering within Jupyter notebooks. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
