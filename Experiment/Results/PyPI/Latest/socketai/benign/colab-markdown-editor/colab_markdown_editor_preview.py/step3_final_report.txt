{
  "purpose": "Render markdown content in a Jupyter notebook preview widget.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'text' parameter in the render() method.",
  "sinks": "The code displays markdown output; no sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into the Markdown display within the widget; no external or network flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for widget display and markdown rendering, defines a class with methods to initialize, render, and expose the widget. It performs simple UI rendering without any network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or handling of sensitive data. The code is clear, readable, and relies solely on well-known APIs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a markdown preview widget for Jupyter notebooks. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
