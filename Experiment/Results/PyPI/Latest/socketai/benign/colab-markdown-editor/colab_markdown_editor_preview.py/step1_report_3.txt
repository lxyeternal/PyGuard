  "purpose": "Render markdown content within an IPython environment using widgets.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the render() method.",
  "sinks": "Markdown rendering display; display() function outputs to notebook interface.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from render() method to Markdown() constructor, then to display(), ultimately rendered in the output widget.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or dynamic code execution. The code uses standard IPython widget features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for rendering markdown in a Jupyter Notebook environment, utilizing ipywidgets and IPython.display. The render() method clears previous output and displays new markdown content, with no external data fetching, no use of environment variables, and no unsafe operations. The widget() method exposes the widget for display. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network calls, file access, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for markdown rendering within Jupyter Notebooks. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
