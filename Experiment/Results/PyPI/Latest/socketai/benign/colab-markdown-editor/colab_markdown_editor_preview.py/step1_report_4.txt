  "purpose": "The code provides a markdown preview widget for Jupyter notebooks using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the render method, and imports from ipywidgets and IPython.display.",
  "targets": "Markdown display and clear_output functions, which could potentially be misused if provided malicious markdown content.",
  "flows": "render() method takes input 'text' and displays it as markdown in the widget, clearing previous output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward and does not perform network operations or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard widget and display modules, defines a class to create a markdown preview pane, and provides methods to render markdown content safely within a Jupyter environment. It does not include any external data fetching, network communication, or obfuscated code. It primarily serves a user interface purpose without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe implementation of a markdown preview widget with no malicious intent or security risks.",
