  "purpose": "Create a simple toolbar with buttons for a markdown editor, allowing users to add formatting options.",
  "sources": "Button labels and handler functions provided during add() calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; handlers are invoked on button clicks without external data processing.",
  "flows": "Button click triggers lambda, which calls the handler function; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Toolbar class that initializes an empty list of buttons. The add() method creates a button with a label, binds the provided handler to its click event via a lambda, and appends it to the list. The widget() method returns an HBox containing all buttons. The code employs standard ipywidgets practices without external data access, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present. The lambda binding is typical for event handling and does not introduce risks. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward UI component for a markdown editor toolbar. It contains no malicious behavior, no security vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
