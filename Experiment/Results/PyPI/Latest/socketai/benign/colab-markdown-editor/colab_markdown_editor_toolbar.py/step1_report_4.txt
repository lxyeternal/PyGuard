  "purpose": "Create a formatting toolbar for a markdown editor using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "User input through button clicks triggering handlers.",
  "sinks": "Execution of handler functions triggered by button clicks.",
  "flows": "Button click events (source) invoke handler functions (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Toolbar class that manages a collection of buttons for a markdown editor. It initializes an empty list of buttons, allows adding buttons with specified labels and handlers, and provides a method to retrieve the toolbar as an ipywidgets.HBox. The button click event is wired to call the provided handler function via a lambda. The code uses only standard library and ipywidgets for UI components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign UI component for an editor toolbar with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
