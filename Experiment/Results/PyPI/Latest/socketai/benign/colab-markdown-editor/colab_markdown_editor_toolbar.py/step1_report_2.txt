  "purpose": "Create a formatting toolbar with buttons for a markdown editor using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "User-defined input: button labels and handler functions provided via 'add' method.",
  "sinks": "Button click triggers handler functions; no direct data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Adding buttons with labels and handlers; clicking a button invokes the associated handler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of lambda in event binding is standard for ipywidgets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Toolbar class that manages ipywidgets buttons for a markdown editor. Buttons are added with labels and click handlers, which are called without any input data processing. The widget method packages the buttons into an HBox for display. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and employs standard library usage without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a GUI toolbar for a markdown editor, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
