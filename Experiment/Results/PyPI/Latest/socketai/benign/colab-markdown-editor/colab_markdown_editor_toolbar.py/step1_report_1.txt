  "purpose": "Create a formatting toolbar for a markdown editor using ipywidgets.",
  "sources": "User-defined input via button labels and handler functions.",
  "sinks": "Button click events invoking handler functions.",
  "flows": "Button click events trigger handler functions when buttons are clicked.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard ipywidgets functions to create and handle buttons.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Toolbar class for a markdown editor interface, using ipywidgets to create buttons dynamically. The add method creates buttons with specified labels and binds them to handler functions. The widget method returns the buttons wrapped in an HBox for display. There are no external data reads, no use of untrusted inputs, no malicious code, and no obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and appears to be for UI purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation of a toolbar for a markdown editor, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
