  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'echoverse' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.md' file, importing setuptools functions, accessing package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code primarily reads files and specifies dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' to include long description → package installation dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without context management could lead to resource leak; no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only potential concern is the 'open' function used to read 'README.md' without a context manager, which is a best practice but not malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are common scientific packages. Overall, the code is straightforward and typical for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
