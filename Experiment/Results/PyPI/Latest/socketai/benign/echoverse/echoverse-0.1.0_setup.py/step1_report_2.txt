  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'echoverse' to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during setup, which is a trusted static file; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling, but this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' modules to configure package setup. It reads 'README.md' for the long description, which is typical. Dependencies are specified clearly. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for package distribution.",
