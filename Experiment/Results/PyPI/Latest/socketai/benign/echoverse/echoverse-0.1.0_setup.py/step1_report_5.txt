  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations, importing setuptools, reading a local README.md file for description, and defining package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network connections, or dynamic code execution is present. All dependencies are specified with version requirements, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
