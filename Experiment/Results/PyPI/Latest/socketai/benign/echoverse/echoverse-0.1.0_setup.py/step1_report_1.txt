  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'echoverse', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; no sensitive sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; straightforward package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local file is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads the README.md file for a long description, which is common practice. No user input handling, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies listed are standard scientific and CUDA-related packages. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
