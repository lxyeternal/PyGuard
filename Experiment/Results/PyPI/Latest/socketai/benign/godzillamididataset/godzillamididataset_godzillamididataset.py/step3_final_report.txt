  "purpose": "A minimal Python module serving as a placeholder or part of a larger MIDI dataset project, with no active logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Import of local module 'TMIDIX', and standard libraries 'random' and 'copy'.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code contains only import statements and an empty function.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'TMIDIX' and standard libraries; no active or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, skeletal module with no data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. The import of 'TMIDIX' is unexplained but not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, secrets, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of active logic justify low security concern. The consistent low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk scores (0-0.1) across reports are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security issues. The low scores assigned in the reports accurately reflect its minimal security risk. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
