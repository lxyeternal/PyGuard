  "purpose": "This module appears to be the main script for a MIDI dataset project named Godzilla, possibly related to a music dataset or processing tool.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local package (.TMIDIX), which could contain additional code or data, and the random and copy modules from Python standard library.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a placeholder function with no implementation; no other suspicious code or secrets detected. No obfuscated or malicious code features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is very minimal, importing a local module and standard libraries, defining an empty placeholder function. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The comments suggest project and licensing information but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The lack of executable logic, data handling, or network activity indicates low risk.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
