  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippets are purely import statements from local modules, importing functions and constants related to MIDI files and chords.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted data handling is observed.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly concluding that these snippets are benign.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of anomalies, suspicious code, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly keep scores at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code only imports local modules; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - Scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base conclusions solely on the code snippet.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks evident.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippets are standard import statements from local modules related to MIDI processing. They pose no security risks, contain no malware, and are not obfuscated. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
