{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and data structures from local modules, likely for processing MIDI files and chord data.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.sample_midis' and '.TMIDIX', which are local modules containing data or functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only static import statements are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard import statements; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports data or functions from internal modules related to MIDI files and chord data. There are no inputs from external sources, no untrusted data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and structurally normal. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The presence of local imports suggests it is part of a larger project, but on its own, it poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple, standard import statement without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
