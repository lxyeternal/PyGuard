{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or variables from local modules related to MIDI files and chord data, likely for music processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local modules: 'sample_midis' (specifically the 'get_sample_midi_files' function) and 'TMIDIX' (specifically 'ALL_CHORDS_SORTED').",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to potential use of the imported data elsewhere; no direct data flow from untrusted sources is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and involves standard import statements; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function likely designed to retrieve MIDI files and a variable representing sorted chord data from local modules. There are no indications of input handling, data processing, or output that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve a typical purpose related to music data processing.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this limited snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard import statements for a music-related project and does not exhibit any anomalies or malicious intent.",
