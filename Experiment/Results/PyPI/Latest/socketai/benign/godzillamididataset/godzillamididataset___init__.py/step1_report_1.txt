  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and data structures from local modules related to MIDI files and chords.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'get_sample_midi_files' and 'ALL_CHORDS_SORTED' from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling observed in these import statements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow observed in import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions and constants from local modules. No runtime logic, input/output handling, or data processing is present that could pose security risks. Importing modules is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code. The code appears to be part of a larger project related to MIDI processing, with no immediate security concerns based solely on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting only of import statements for local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
