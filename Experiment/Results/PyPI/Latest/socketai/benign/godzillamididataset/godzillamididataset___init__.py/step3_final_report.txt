  "purpose": "Import local modules related to MIDI files and chords for processing within a larger music project.",
  "sources": "The import statements from .sample_midis and .TMIDIX modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing functions and constants from local modules. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be part of a modular MIDI processing system. Given the benign nature and lack of suspicious patterns, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of straightforward import statements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security threats. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
