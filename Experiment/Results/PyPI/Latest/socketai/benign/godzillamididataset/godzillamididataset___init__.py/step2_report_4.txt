  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to MIDI files and chords.\n- No data processing, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a music processing project, with no immediate security concerns based solely on these snippets.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - Justification: The code is straightforward import statements with no malicious intent. The high confidence score is justified.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - Justification: Same reasoning as above; standard import statements with no suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - Justification: Again, no signs of malicious activity; purely import statements.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 0.9\n   - Justification: Slightly less than perfect confidence due to the mention of specific data (functions and variables), but still no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - Justification: Same as others; benign import statements.\n\n**Malware Scores:**\n- All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All are 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code snippets are benign, standard import statements with no malicious intent or security issues. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided snippets and reports, I agree with the current scores. The code is safe, unobfuscated, and poses no security risk.",
