{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and data structures from local modules, likely for use in processing MIDI files and chords.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.sample_midis' and '.TMIDIX' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or source-to-sink paths in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is typical for modular code organization. No external data, user input, or potentially malicious instructions are present. The imported names suggest MIDI file handling and chord data, which align with musical processing functionality. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as part of a larger project to handle MIDI data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these imports alone.",
