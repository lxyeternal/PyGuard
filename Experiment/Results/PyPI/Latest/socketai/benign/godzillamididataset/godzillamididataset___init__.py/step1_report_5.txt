  "purpose": "Importing functions and data structures from local modules related to MIDI files and chords.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.sample_midis' and '.TMIDIX' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; just static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; simple import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is common in modular Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The modules being imported appear to contain MIDI-related data and chord information, which are typical for music processing applications. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as import statements for local MIDI and chord data modules. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
