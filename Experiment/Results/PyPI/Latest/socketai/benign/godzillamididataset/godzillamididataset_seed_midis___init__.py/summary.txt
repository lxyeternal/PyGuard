  "conclusion": "The existing reports are consistent and appropriately score the analyzed code snippets. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The overall assessment supports a benign view of the dependencies, with low risk scores justified by the available information. No adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring for dynamic or obfuscated code is recommended in future analyses."
