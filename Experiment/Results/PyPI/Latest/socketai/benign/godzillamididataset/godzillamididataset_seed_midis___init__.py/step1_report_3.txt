{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for processing user input and performing calculations or string manipulations, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from standard input and possibly environment variables or configuration files if present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; no use of network, files, or external processes observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed locally and results are displayed; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input or configuration data, processes it using standard Python functions, and outputs the result. It does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or system calls that are suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors were identified. The code structure is straightforward and uses common programming constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
