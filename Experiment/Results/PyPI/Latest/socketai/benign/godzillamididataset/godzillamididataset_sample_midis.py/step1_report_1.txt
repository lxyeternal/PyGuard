  "purpose": "To list and retrieve sample MIDI files from the 'seed_midis' package resources.",
  "sources": "Reading contents of the 'seed_midis' package resources via 'pkg_resources.contents'.",
  "sinks": "Returning a sorted list of resource filenames and their paths; no data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: 'pkg_resources.contents' → filtering and path retrieval → appending to 'midi_files' list → return sorted list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of standard resource listing and path handling is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports resource management tools to list files within a package. It filters for files ending with '.mid' and retrieves their paths, storing them in a list for return. The process appears straightforward and intended for resource enumeration. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The module's functionality seems limited to listing MIDI files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple resource listing function with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input in a harmful way, nor does it perform any insecure operations. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
