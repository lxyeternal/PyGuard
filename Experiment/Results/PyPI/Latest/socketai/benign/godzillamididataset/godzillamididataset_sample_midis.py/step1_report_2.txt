  "purpose": "Provides a function to list MIDI files from the 'seed_midis' package resources.",
  "sources": "Reads package resources using importlib.resources.contents and importlib.resources.path.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads resource names, filters for '.mid' files, retrieves their paths, and returns sorted list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package resources and iterates through contents to find MIDI files. It uses importlib.resources to access package data safely and appends resource names and paths to a list, which is then sorted and returned. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted user input. The logic is straightforward and typical for resource listing.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a simple resource listing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as intended without performing any unsafe operations.",
