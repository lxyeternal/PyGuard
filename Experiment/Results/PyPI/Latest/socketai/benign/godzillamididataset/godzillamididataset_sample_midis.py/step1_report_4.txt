{
  "purpose": "The module is designed to list MIDI files embedded as resources within the 'seed_midis' package and return their names and paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads package resources via 'pkg_resources.contents', iterates over resources, and accesses their file paths using 'pkg_resources.path'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only reads package resources and returns file paths.",
  "flows": "The resource list is filtered for '.mid' files, and their paths are retrieved and returned in sorted order.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard resource management functions is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package resources and a module 'seed_midis'. It defines a function to iterate over package resources within 'seed_midis', filters for files ending with '.mid', retrieves their filesystem paths, and returns a sorted list of tuples containing filename and path. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no external network interactions are present. The logic appears standard for accessing package resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical resource listing utility for MIDI files packaged within a Python module. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security issues are evident.",
