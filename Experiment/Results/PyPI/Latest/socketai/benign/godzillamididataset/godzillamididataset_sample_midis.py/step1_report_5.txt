  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve sample MIDI files embedded within the 'seed_midis' package.",
  "sources": "Reads contents of the 'seed_midis' package using importlib.resources.contents and pkg_resources.path",
  "sinks": "Returns a list of resource names and their file paths; no untrusted data output or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Reads package contents (source) and constructs a list with resource names and file paths (sink), without data modification or external network activity",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports resource management utilities and a dataset module, then defines a function to list MIDI files embedded in the package. It iterates over package contents, filters for '.mid' files, retrieves their paths, and returns a sorted list of tuples. The code appears straightforward and intended for retrieving embedded sample files without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility to list embedded MIDI files within a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard package resource listing without external communication or data leakage.",
