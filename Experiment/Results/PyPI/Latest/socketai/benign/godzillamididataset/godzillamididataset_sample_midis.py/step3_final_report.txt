  "purpose": "List embedded MIDI files within the seed_midis package resources.",
  "sources": "Resource contents of seed_midis package, specifically files ending with '.mid'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads package resources and does not process untrusted input or output data externally.",
  "flows": "Listing resources -> Filtering for '.mid' files -> Retrieving file paths -> Returning sorted list of (filename, path) tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward resource enumeration with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.resources to list package resources, filters for MIDI files, retrieves their filesystem paths, and returns a sorted list. It performs no network activity, code execution, or handling of untrusted input. The logic is standard and safe. No security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe resource listing utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
