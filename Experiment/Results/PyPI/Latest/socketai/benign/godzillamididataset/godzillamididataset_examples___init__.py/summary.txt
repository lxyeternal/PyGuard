  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious activity, especially in reports 2 and 3. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 aligns better with its suspicious patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, and further runtime analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
