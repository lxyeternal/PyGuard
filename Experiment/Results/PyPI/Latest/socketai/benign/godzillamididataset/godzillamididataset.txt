The malware score should remain low (around 0.0-0.1), obfuscation slightly above zero (around 0.2), and overall security risk low (around 0.2). No concrete malicious activity is detected; the assessments are consistent and justified."

The overall assessment supports a benign view of the dependencies, with low risk scores justified by the available information. No adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring for dynamic or obfuscated code is recommended in future analyses."

The remaining reports are benign, with appropriate low scores. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary."

Slightly increasing the malware score for report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 aligns better with its suspicious patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, and further runtime analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
