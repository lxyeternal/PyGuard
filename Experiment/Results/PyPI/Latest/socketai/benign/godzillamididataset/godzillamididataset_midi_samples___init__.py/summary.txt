  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign, with minor suspicion due to obfuscation in some reports. The malware score should remain low (around 0.0-0.1), obfuscation slightly above zero (around 0.2), and overall security risk low (around 0.2). No concrete malicious activity is detected; the assessments are consistent and justified."
