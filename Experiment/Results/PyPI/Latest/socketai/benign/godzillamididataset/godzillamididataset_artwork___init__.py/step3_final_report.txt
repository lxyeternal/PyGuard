  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security risks in the analyzed Python dependency based on code behavior, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution, network requests, environment variable reads, and any hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, and dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or environment reads leading to sinks like network requests or file writes, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution (eval/exec), network requests to suspicious domains, hardcoded credentials, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code review identified that reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 show minimal or benign activity with no signs of malicious behavior, consistent with their low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 exhibits obfuscated code, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.8), and risk (0.75) scores. The scores align with the described behaviors, with no contradictions or signs of false positives. Slightly increasing the obfuscation score for report 5 from 0.4 to 0.5 could reflect the mention of unnecessary dynamic execution, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the high suspicion in report 3 warrants the elevated scores, while others remain benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that report 3 contains likely malicious obfuscated code with dynamic execution and network activity, justifying high malware and risk scores. The remaining reports are benign, with appropriate low scores. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
