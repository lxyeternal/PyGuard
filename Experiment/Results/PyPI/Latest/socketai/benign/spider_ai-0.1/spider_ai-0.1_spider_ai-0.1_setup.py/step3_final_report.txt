  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters, including package name, version, author, description (in Arabic), classifiers, and Python requirements. No dynamic code, external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The description string is benign. All indicators point to a simple, static package configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
