  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'spider_ai' including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads package setup information and metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata to executing setuptools.setup(), which orchestrates package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls its setup() function with package metadata such as name, version, author, description, package discovery, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The description is in Arabic but is simply a descriptive string. No user input, external data, or potentially unsafe operations are involved. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The script is a typical setup.py used for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
