  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'spider_ai' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely specifies package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The description contains Arabic text but that is not unusual in internationalized code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors such as network activity or secret handling. The package configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward package configuration file.",
