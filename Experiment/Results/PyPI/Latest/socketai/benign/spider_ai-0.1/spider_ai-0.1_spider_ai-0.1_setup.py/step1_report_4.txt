  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'spider_ai' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setuptools' for package setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code is straightforward and typical of a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata, including name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers, and required Python version. The description contains Arabic text but no executable code or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script is standard for Python package distribution and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
