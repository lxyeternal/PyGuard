  "purpose": "Define abstract base class and utility functions for handling machine learning models and data conversions between numpy and torch.",
  "sources": "Imports from runlocal_tools.dtypes.upload, numpy, torch, and standard libraries; functions for converting data types.",
  "sinks": "Data conversion functions (convert_numpy_dict_to_torch, convert_torch_dict_to_numpy) that handle data transformations; no direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Numpy arrays are converted to torch tensors and vice versa; data flows between conversion functions without external input manipulation or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; no code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code mostly provides an interface and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data conversion functions and an abstract model interface. These functions perform straightforward data type transformations without any external input handling, network operations, or system modifications. The Model class is an abstract base with no executable logic; it simply outlines methods that would be implemented elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The structure and content are typical of a machine learning framework interface.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign, serving as a utility and interface layer for ML model handling. No malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
