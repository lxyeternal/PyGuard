  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment statement setting the __version__ attribute to '0.0.1'. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No use of dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials beyond the version string, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. It serves solely as a version indicator for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
