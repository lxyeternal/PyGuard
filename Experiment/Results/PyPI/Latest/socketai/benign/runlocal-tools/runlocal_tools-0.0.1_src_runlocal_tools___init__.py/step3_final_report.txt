  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the package metadata, indicating the current version of the package.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version declaration with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice for package metadata. It contains no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic behavior. The code is minimal, static, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or changes are necessary.",
