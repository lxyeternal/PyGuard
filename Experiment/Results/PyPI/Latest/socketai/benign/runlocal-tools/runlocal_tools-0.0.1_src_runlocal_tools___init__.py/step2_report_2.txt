  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a string to `__version__`. This is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning metadata. The code is minimal, static, and does not perform any dynamic operations, input/output, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Anomalies**  \nAll reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Given the simplicity of the code, this assessment appears accurate.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly note the absence of data flows, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Security Risk (0)**: Correct, no security risks are present.\n\n5. **Potential for Change in Scores**  \nSince the code is purely a static version assignment, increasing any scores would be unjustified. The reports are justified in assigning a maximum confidence of 1 and scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \nNo assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here. The code's purpose is clear and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a straightforward, safe snippet with no malicious or obfuscated elements. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
