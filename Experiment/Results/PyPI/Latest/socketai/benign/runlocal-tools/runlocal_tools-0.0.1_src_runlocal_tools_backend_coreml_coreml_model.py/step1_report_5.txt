  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class for managing, loading, compiling, and interacting with CoreML models, including version handling, model hashing, renaming features, and preparing inputs/outputs for inference.",
  "sources": "Model files on disk (model_path, model's spec, weights, compiled model files), user-provided data inputs for inference, spec files for version info.",
  "sinks": "Model inference functions (predict), file read/write operations, model hashing, model renaming, model loading.",
  "flows": "Input data (from user/input source) flows into prepare_inputs() -> execute() -> output dict; model files are read for hashing and loading; model features are renamed; model specifications are accessed and modified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of standard cryptographic hashing (MD5) is safe here; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed; model files and specifications are handled in a standard manner. No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing CoreML models, including loading, compiling, renaming features, and preparing data for inference. It uses hashlib for hashing model files, with no unusual or suspicious file access patterns. The input preparation accepts various data types, converting to numpy arrays, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of MD5 for hashing is acceptable in this context since it's used for versioning and integrity checks, not security-critical signatures. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to model management. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical model management utility with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles models securely, with appropriate file and data handling, and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic. The overall security risk is minimal.",
