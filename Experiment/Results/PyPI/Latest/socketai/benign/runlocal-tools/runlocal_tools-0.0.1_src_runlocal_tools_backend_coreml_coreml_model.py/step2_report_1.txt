  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages CoreML models, reads files, handles model spec, and accepts various input formats.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes predictions locally; no external data exfiltration.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. It performs standard model management.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code appears benign, standard ML deployment code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable given the low complexity and no external communication.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar model management, with file hashing, renaming, and cleanup.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses `shutil.rmtree`, moves files, performs hashing.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Cleanup via `shutil.rmtree` is standard; no suspicious network activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, standard procedures.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The use of `shutil.rmtree` is common but can be misused if temp dirs are mismanaged. However, in this context, it’s appropriate.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on model loading, hashing, renaming.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** File reads, model execution, spec modifications.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No network, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard model management, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is consistent with normal ML workflows.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on loading, hashing, renaming, and execution.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Prediction functions, file operations, spec manipulations.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no network activity, standard practices.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—model management, hashing, input prep.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Model execution, file I/O, renaming.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, legitimate code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity or sabotage.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) across reports, reflecting low but non-zero risk typical for code that manipulates files and models locally.\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious intent)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard for file and model management code)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type   | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Risk         | 0.2            |\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured ML model management utility with no malicious activity.",
