{
  "purpose": "The code manages CoreML models, including loading, compiling, hashing, renaming features, and performing inference. It handles model files locally without external communication.",
  "sources": "Reads model files from disk, including spec files, weight files, and model binaries; accesses model attributes and spec descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Performs file operations such as moving and deleting directories; calls model prediction functions; modifies model specifications.",
  "flows": "Loads models from disk -> processes spec and weights -> executes prediction -> saves or moves files as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity. Uses standard cleanup functions (`shutil.rmtree`) appropriately. Hashing excludes non-deterministic files.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model management tasks: loading models, compiling, hashing for versioning, renaming features, and executing predictions. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious code are present. File operations are typical for cleanup and management. The hashing approach is standard, and spec modifications are legitimate. No obfuscation or secrets are detected. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate ML deployment utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing CoreML models with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It employs standard practices for file handling, model processing, and prediction. The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concerns primarily related to file operations, which are controlled and typical.",
