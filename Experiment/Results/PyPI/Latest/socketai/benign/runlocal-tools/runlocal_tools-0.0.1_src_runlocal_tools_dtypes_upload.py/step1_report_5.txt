{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different types of uploaded machine learning models and formats.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines a class with constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely defining constants without external interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; this is a static enumeration definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module and defines a class 'UploadedModelType' inheriting from str and Enum, listing various string constants representing model formats. The class serves as a type-safe enumeration for categorizing model uploads. No data input, external interactions, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is straightforward and standard for defining enums. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum class for categorizing model types; it poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
