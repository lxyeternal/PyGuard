{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different types of uploaded machine learning models",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code solely defines an Enum class",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; static declaration of enum members",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and contains only enum definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a class UploadedModelType that inherits from str and Enum, listing various model type identifiers as class attributes. The code appears to be a standard, static definition for categorizing model types, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
