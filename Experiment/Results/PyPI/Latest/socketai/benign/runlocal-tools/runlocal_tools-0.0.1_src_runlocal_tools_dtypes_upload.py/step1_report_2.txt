  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for different types of machine learning models and formats used for uploading models.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only defines static enumeration values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; purely defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a straightforward enum definition with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a class 'UploadedModelType' inheriting from str and Enum, listing various model format identifiers as class attributes with string values. No user input, data handling, or external dependencies are involved. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a constant reference for model type strings within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely serves as a set of constants for model types.",
