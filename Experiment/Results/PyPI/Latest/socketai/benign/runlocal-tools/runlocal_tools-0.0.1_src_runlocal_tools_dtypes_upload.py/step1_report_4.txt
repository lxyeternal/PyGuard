{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for different types of machine learning models and formats.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code is a static class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling; this is a simple enum declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with string values representing various ML model types and formats. It is straightforward, standard usage of Python's enum.Enum, with no dynamic code execution, input/output operations, or security-sensitive functions. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code. No external data interaction or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a clean, simple enumeration definition meant for use elsewhere in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum definition for model types, with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is safe and appears solely to facilitate model type categorization.",
