{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of string constants representing various machine learning model formats for categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes within the enum, no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - purely declarative constants, no data flow or execution flow involving external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard enum pattern without obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple enumeration class listing model format identifiers as string constants. It contains no dynamic behavior, external input, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a reference for model types elsewhere in the application. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no further action is needed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration for categorizing ML model formats. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is purely declarative. The scores are consistent with its nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
