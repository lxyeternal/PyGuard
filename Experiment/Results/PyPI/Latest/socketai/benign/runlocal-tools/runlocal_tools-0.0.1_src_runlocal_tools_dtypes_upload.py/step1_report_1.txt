{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for various uploaded model types, likely used to categorize or handle different machine learning model formats.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading operations; all data is defined statically within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes an enumeration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, using standard enum class to define constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and creates a subclass 'UploadedModelType' that contains string-based enumeration members representing various ML model formats. No dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external inputs, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical and intended for defining constants. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign enumeration definition for categorizing different ML model formats. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified in this snippet.",
