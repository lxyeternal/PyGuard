  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; the flow is static and only outputs a fixed message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and minimal code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello_world' that outputs a greeting message. It includes an entry point check that executes this function when the script runs directly. There are no data inputs, external dependencies, or any operations that could lead to data leaks, malicious activity, or security issues. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to print a greeting message and contains no suspicious elements.",
