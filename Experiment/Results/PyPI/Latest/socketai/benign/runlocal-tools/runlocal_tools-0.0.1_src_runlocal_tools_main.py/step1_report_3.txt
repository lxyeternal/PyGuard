  "purpose": "Prints 'Hello, world!' to the console.",
  "sources": "Input is minimal; the main source is the function call under the '__main__' check, which triggers printing.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the print statement which outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from the '__main__' check to the 'hello_world()' function, then to the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that prints a greeting message. It includes a standard '__main__' entry point. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. The code performs a benign print operation with no malicious behavior or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, benign Python script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prints a greeting message. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
