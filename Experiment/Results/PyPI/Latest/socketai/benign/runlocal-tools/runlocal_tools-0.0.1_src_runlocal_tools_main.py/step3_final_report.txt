  "purpose": "A simple Python script that prints 'Hello, world!' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs to the console via print().",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function call directly prints a static message with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prints a static message and executes it if run as the main module. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic behaviors. The code is minimal, clear, and free of any malicious or security-related elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are consistent with its straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary.",
