  "purpose": "Import the ServerGUI class from the main module, likely for initializing or using a graphical user interface related to server management.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package's main module to import ServerGUI.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from a single import statement; it merely makes a class available in the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports ServerGUI from a relative module named main. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It does not contain any code execution, data handling, or network operations. The import is typical for Python projects organizing code into modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It appears to be part of a larger project setup. No suspicious activity is detected.",
