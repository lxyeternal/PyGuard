{
  "purpose": "Import the ServerGUI class from the main module, likely for initializing or running a graphical user interface server component.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.main' when importing 'ServerGUI'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from the local 'main' module are static; no runtime data flow observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement that pulls 'ServerGUI' from a relative module named 'main'. There are no input sources, data flows, or potential security-sensitive operations present. The simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent. Without additional context or code execution, no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a standard import of a GUI class with no indications of malicious or maliciously obfuscated activity.",
