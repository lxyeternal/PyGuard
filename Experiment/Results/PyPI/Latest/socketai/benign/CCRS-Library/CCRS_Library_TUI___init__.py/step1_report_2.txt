{
  "purpose": "Importing the ServerGUI class from the main module, likely for initializing or controlling a server graphical interface.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import ServerGUI, which reads code from the local main module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this single line; potential issues could arise if ServerGUI is instantiated or used elsewhere with malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Not applicable at this point; no execution flow beyond import is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is standard practice. Since the import statement alone does not execute any code, it poses no direct security risk. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Without additional context on how ServerGUI is used or instantiated, this snippet appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not present any security risks by itself.",
