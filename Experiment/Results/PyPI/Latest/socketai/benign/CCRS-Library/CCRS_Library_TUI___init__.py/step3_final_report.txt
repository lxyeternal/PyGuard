  "purpose": "Import the ServerGUI class from a local module within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import does not involve runtime data transfer or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with standard syntax, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement in Python, typical for modular codebases. It does not execute code, handle input, or perform any operations that could pose security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The security risk scores are minimal (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the limited context. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores across reports are consistent and justified. No further action or concern is necessary based solely on this code snippet.",
