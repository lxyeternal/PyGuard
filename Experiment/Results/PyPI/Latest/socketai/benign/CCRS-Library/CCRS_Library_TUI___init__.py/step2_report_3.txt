  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import ServerGUI`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or network activity is involved.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Importing `ServerGUI` from a local module.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that this is a benign import statement with no security concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Scores:** \n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate, as import alone is harmless.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Also correctly states that the import is benign and standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risk.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating, but acceptable considering potential misuse if the imported class is malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that this is a simple import with no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the import is straightforward and benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, minimal import with no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is only an import statement, with no execution or data flow.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No additional risks or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk from this import statement.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action needed.",
