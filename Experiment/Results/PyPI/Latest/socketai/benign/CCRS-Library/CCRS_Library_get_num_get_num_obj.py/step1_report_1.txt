{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image preprocessing, object detection inference using YOLO, and result visualization/saving.",
  "sources": "The code reads image files via cv2.imread and os.path.exists, and loads a model from an embedded resource using importlib.resources.path.",
  "sinks": "The code writes images using cv2.imwrite and potentially displays images via cv2.imshow. It also removes a temporary image file with os.remove.",
  "flows": "Image is loaded from disk, preprocessed, passed to the YOLO model for inference, results are processed and visualized, and images are saved or displayed accordingly. Temporary files are deleted after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity observed. The code replaces pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath dynamically, which is benign. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms are detected. All resource access appears to be local and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing, model inference, and result visualization. It loads models from package resources, processes images with OpenCV, and handles file I/O safely. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of importlib.resources for model loading and the image handling procedures are standard. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate image processing and detection pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical image preprocessing and object detection utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. No malware or security threats are identified.",
