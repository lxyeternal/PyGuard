{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image preprocessing, skew correction, object detection using YOLO, and visualization/saving of results.",
  "sources": "Reads images from disk (`cv2.imread`, `importlib.resources.path`), loads model weights, and uses model inference results.",
  "sinks": "Saves images to disk (`cv2.imwrite`), displays images (`cv2.imshow`), and removes files (`os.remove`).",
  "flows": "Image data flows from disk read to preprocessing, then into YOLO inference, with results visualized or saved, and temporary files deleted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. Path replacement for cross-platform compatibility is standard. Image processing steps are typical; no obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads and preprocesses images, performs skew correction, loads a YOLO model for object detection, and visualizes/saves results. It uses standard libraries and methods for image analysis, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No network activity, system info theft, or unauthorized data exfiltration is present. Temporary file deletion is handled properly. All operations appear aligned with normal image processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image processing pipeline with object detection capabilities, without signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It uses standard techniques and libraries for its purpose.",
