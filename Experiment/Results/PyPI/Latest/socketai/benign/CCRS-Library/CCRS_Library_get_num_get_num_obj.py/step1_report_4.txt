{
  "purpose": "This code loads a YOLO model, processes images for skew correction, pre-processing, and object detection, then saves and displays results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk using cv2.imread, loads model files via importlib.resources, and uses environment variables for path handling.",
  "sinks": "Saves images using cv2.imwrite, displays images with cv2.imshow, and deletes temporary files with os.remove.",
  "flows": "Loads image -> preprocesses and deskews -> passes to YOLO model for inference -> sorts results -> annotates images -> saves and displays outputs -> deletes temp image.",
  "anomalies": "The code temporarily replaces pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath, which could be unusual but is meant for cross-platform compatibility; no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are evident; all external inputs are image files, with no evident untrusted data injection. The code imports and uses the ultralytics YOLO model directly and performs standard image processing operations. There are no obfuscated code patterns or suspicious network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform legitimate image processing and object detection tasks. It loads models securely using importlib.resources, processes images with common OpenCV techniques, and manages file I/O responsibly. The only unusual part is the path manipulation via pathlib, which is for compatibility and not malicious. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or covert network communications. All functions handle their tasks transparently, with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard image processing and object detection pipeline with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. Its operations are consistent with legitimate use cases, and no malicious behaviors are detected.",
