{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for loading an object detection model (YOLO), preprocessing images, performing inference, and saving or displaying results, likely for object recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified paths, including a model file from package resources, and reads environment and file system info.",
  "sinks": "Saves images to disk, displays images via OpenCV windows, and deletes files after processing.",
  "flows": "Loads model from package resources → preprocesses images → runs inference → displays or saves results → deletes temporary image files.",
  "anomalies": "Path replacement of pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is observed. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious backdoor behaviors are present. The code handles images and model files securely. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image preprocessing, model loading, inference, and result visualization without any suspicious logic. It uses common libraries (OpenCV, numpy, ultralytics) in a typical manner. Path manipulations are for cross-platform compatibility, not malicious. No external network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code respects data flow from input files to output files with no hidden or malicious intent. The deletion of temporary files is a routine cleanup step.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical image processing and object detection functions with proper handling and no suspicious activity.",
