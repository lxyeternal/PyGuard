  "purpose": "The code performs image preprocessing, skew correction, object detection using YOLO, and visualization of results.",
  "sources": "Reads image from a file path; loads model from package resources; uses cv2 functions for image processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed images; displays images via cv2.imshow; saves images to disk.",
  "flows": "Image is loaded and resized -> converted to grayscale -> processed with adaptive thresholding -> morphological operations -> deskewed -> model inference -> visualization and saving.",
  "anomalies": "Path replacement of pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath for cross-platform compatibility; no suspicious code or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard image processing libraries and techniques, loads a model from package resources, and performs object detection. The path class replacement is a common workaround for cross-platform compatibility, not malicious obfuscation. No network activity, code injection, or hidden payloads are present. The model inference and visualization are typical for such applications. The minor path handling technique slightly increases obfuscation score but is benign. No suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image preprocessing and object detection pipeline with no malicious intent. The minor path replacement is a standard compatibility measure, not malicious obfuscation. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0.2 due to path class replacement, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minor obfuscation but overall low risk.",
