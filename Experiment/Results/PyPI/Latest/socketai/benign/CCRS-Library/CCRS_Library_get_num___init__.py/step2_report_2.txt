  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe straightforward import statements from local modules, with no data handling, network activity, or execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** only contains import statements for three functions from sibling modules.\n- There are **no signs of code execution, data flow, or external communication**.\n- The code appears to be **standard modular Python code**.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk or suggest malicious intent where there is none.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malware activity.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n### Potential areas for reconsideration:\n- Since the code is purely import statements, **risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted**.\n- The reports’ high confidence levels are justified.\n- The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the provided reports. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The import statements are common in modular Python projects, and there are no indicators of compromise or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that. No further action or concern is necessary based on this snippet.",
