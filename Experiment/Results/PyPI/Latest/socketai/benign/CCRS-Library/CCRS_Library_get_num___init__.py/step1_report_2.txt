  "purpose": "Import main functions from local modules for object detection or classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.get_num_cls, .get_num_obb, .get_num_obj).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; merely imports.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward import statements with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three main functions from sibling modules, likely for use elsewhere in the project. There are no indications of data handling, user input, or external data sources, nor any dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The structure appears typical for a modular Python project. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import operations without any malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger project setup, with no immediate concerns.",
