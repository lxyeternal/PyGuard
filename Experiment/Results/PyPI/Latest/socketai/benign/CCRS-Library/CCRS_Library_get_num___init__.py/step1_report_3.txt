{
  "purpose": "This code imports main functions from three local modules, likely to invoke their functionality elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data sources are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only imports functions; there is no execution or data transfer shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard import statements. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No backdoors or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports three functions from sibling modules within the same package. These functions are likely used later in the application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this import pattern. The code is minimal and appears to serve a standard modular design purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or anomalies. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for a Python project structure.",
