  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of three local modules' main functions.\n- No data flow, network activity, or execution is shown.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard modular Python code, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Content:\n- The original code is straightforward: it imports three functions (`get_num_cls.main`, `get_num_obb.main`, `get_num_obj.main`) from sibling modules.\n- There is no execution, data handling, or external communication shown in this snippet.\n- **No issues are present in the code itself.**\n\n---\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The import statements are correct syntax-wise.\n- No security flaws, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns, are present.\n- **No mistakes or issues are identified.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n  \n- These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that because the code is only import statements, it cannot be malicious. This is correct for this snippet.\n- However, if these modules are later used maliciously elsewhere, that would be outside the scope of this fragment.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and standard nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, standard import pattern with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
