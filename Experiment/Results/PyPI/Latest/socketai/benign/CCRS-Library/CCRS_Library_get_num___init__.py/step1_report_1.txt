  "purpose": "This code imports main functions from three local modules: get_num_cls, get_num_obb, and get_num_obj.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; only function imports without execution or data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three functions from sibling modules within the same package. There is no execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious logic present. Without additional context or code execution, this appears to be standard modular Python code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward import statements without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be normal module setup code.",
