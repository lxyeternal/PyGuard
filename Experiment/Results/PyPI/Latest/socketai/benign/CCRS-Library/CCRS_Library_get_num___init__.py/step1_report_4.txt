  "purpose": "Import main functions from local modules for further use within the package",
  "sources": "Local module files: get_num_cls, get_num_obb, get_num_obj",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; only function imports are shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports three functions from local modules within the same package. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no network operations. The structure is typical for modular Python code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. Since the code only performs imports, it does not introduce risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and performs standard module imports. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are evident in this fragment.",
