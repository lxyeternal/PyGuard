  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores, considering the code context.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: simple import statements of three local functions.\n- No execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores assigned are predominantly 0 or very close to 0, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code?**  \n- The code only contains import statements; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious activity in the code snippet.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.  \n- No logical flaws detected.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- `malware` scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign analysis.  \n- `securityRisk` scores are 0, also appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or 0.1.  \n- This is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**5. Malware score reflection:**  \n- Since no malicious activity is identified, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions?**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The code is purely import statements, standard in modular Python projects.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **0** — No security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-aligned with the code snippet. The scores are appropriate and justified. There is no need to adjust any scores upward, as the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the scores as is: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No further action needed based on this code fragment.",
