{
  "purpose": "The code imports main functions from three local modules related to obtaining numerical values or counts, likely for processing or analysis tasks within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules (.get_num_cls, .get_num_obb, .get_num_obj) and their 'main' functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, which is typical in modular Python packages. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic within this fragment. The imported functions are named 'main', which suggests they serve as entry points for further processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The code appears to be part of a standard package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and typical of modular Python projects. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. The import statements are standard and do not indicate malware or security risks.",
