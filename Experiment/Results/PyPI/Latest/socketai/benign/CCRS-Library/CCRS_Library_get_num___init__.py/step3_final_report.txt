{
  "purpose": "This code imports three main functions from sibling modules, likely for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files get_num_cls.py, get_num_obb.py, and get_num_obj.py to import their main functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing functions; no data flows, execution, or external communication are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing 'main' functions from three local modules. No data handling, network activity, or execution occurs within this snippet. The code is typical for modular Python projects, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of import statements with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
