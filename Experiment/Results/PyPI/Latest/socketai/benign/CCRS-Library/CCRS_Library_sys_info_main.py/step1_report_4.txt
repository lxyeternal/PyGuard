{
  "purpose": "The code collects various system information, including hardware specs, network data, external IP, and system uptime, and continuously transmits this data to connected clients over a socket connection.",
  "sources": "Requests to external API for IP info; system data retrieval functions; WiFi info collection via 'wifi' library; socketio emit calls for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "socketio.emit calls transmitting system data to clients; external API response for IP address.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system sources (hardware info, network, external API), formatted as JSON, then sent via socket.io to clients in an infinite loop.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external API to fetch IP info could be for tracking; no hardcoded credentials; data collection appears normal; no obfuscated code or malicious API endpoints; no suspicious file operations or reverse shells.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically gathers detailed system information including CPU, GPU, memory, network, and external IP, then transmits this data repeatedly to connected clients. All data sources are standard system calls, libraries, and API requests. No suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The external IP fetch is from a known API, possibly for network monitoring or asset tracking. The continuous data push is typical in monitoring tools and does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no evidence of malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate system monitoring script with data collection and real-time reporting functionality. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. External API usage is consistent with IP geolocation or monitoring. Overall, it is a standard system info gathering and reporting script with no malicious behavior.",
