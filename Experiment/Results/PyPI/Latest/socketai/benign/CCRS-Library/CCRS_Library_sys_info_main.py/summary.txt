  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system monitoring script that collects and transmits system data continuously. It does not contain malicious behavior or payloads. The primary concerns relate to privacy and resource usage, not security. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
