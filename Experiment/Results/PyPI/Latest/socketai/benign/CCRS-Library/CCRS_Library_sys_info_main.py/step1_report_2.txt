  "purpose": "Collect detailed system, hardware, network, and external IP information for monitoring or diagnostic purposes.",
  "sources": "External IP retrieval via HTTP request; system info via platform, psutil, winreg, GPUtil; network interfaces via psutil; WiFi info via wifi module.",
  "sinks": "Emitted data sent over socketio; external IP data retrieved via HTTP request; potentially sensitive system info stored in dictionaries.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from various sources -> formatted as JSON -> emitted over socketio; external IP fetched via HTTP GET request -> parsed and stored.",
  "anomalies": "Use of requests to fetch external IP without validation or encryption; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures; regular data collection functions.",
  "analysis": "The code collects comprehensive system and network information, including external IP, hardware specs, CPU, GPU, memory, network stats, WiFi info, and system uptime. It uses standard libraries and publicly available modules. No indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The external IP request is straightforward, and data transmission occurs via socketio without apparent malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. The data collected could be sensitive, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The code appears intended for system monitoring or diagnostics.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs extensive system information gathering for legitimate purposes such as monitoring or diagnostics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious code embedded. No security risks or malware signals are evident. External IP fetching and socket emission are standard operations within such contexts. Overall, the code is benign with low likelihood of malicious intent.",
