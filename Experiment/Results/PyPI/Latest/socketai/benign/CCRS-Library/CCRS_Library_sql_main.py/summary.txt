  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard database management utility with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the execute_custom_sql function, which could be exploited if exposed to untrusted input. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of approximately 0.2 to 0.3 is justified given the potential for misuse, but no active malicious behavior is detected."
