{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image preprocessing, model loading, and object detection using YOLO, with functionality for image correction, saving, and displaying results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified paths; accesses model files via importlib.resources; reads environment variables (not explicitly shown but implied by model resource loading).",
  "sinks": "Saves images to disk; displays images via cv2.imshow; deletes image files via os.remove.",
  "flows": "Loads image -> preprocesses (deskew, thresholding, contour filtering) -> feeds into YOLO model for prediction -> displays and/or saves results -> deletes temp files.",
  "anomalies": "Replaces pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath at runtime, which is unusual but benign; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows detected; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors; model loading from resources is standard; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical image processing and object detection tasks without suspicious behavior. It includes model loading via importlib.resources, which is standard. Image manipulation, display, and save operations are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or backdoors are present. The replacement of pathlib paths is unusual but not malicious. The use of os.remove for cleanup and display functions is normal. Overall, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image preprocessing and object detection script without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles image loading, processing, model inference, and result display/saving appropriately. No indicators of malware or malicious sabotage are identified.",
