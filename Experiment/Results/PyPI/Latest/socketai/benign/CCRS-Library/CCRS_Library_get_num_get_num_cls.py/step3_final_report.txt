{
  "purpose": "The code loads a YOLO model, preprocesses images (including skew correction), performs object detection, and displays or saves results.",
  "sources": "Image files read via cv2.imread; model loaded via importlib.resources; image data processed through OpenCV functions.",
  "sinks": "Results displayed with cv2.imshow; images saved with cv2.imwrite; temporary files deleted with os.remove.",
  "flows": "Image file read -> preprocessing (resize, grayscale, threshold, morphology, deskew) -> model inference -> display/save results.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual runtime replacement of pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath on Windows systems; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image preprocessing and object detection tasks with no signs of malicious activity. The platform-specific path class replacement is atypical but appears intended for cross-platform compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The model is loaded from package resources, and results are displayed or saved accordingly. The minor path replacement does not introduce security risks but should be documented. Overall, the code is benign, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to the path class replacement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing pipeline with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The unusual path class replacement is benign and does not elevate risk significantly. The overall assessment indicates a safe and legitimate implementation.",
