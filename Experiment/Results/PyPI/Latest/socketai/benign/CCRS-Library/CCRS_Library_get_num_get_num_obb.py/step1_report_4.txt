{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image processing, skew correction, object detection using YOLO, and saving or displaying results.",
  "sources": "Reading image files via cv2.imread, loading model via importlib.resources.path, reading configuration, and user-provided image paths.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite (saving images), cv2.imshow (displaying images), os.remove (deleting files), and network calls through the YOLO model inference.",
  "flows": "Image is loaded from a specified path, preprocessed, then passed into the YOLO model for inference; results are processed, visualized, and optionally saved or displayed; temporary files are deleted at the end.",
  "anomalies": "Replacing pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath on all systems is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; model loading uses importlib.resources, which is standard; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic code; no network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image preprocessing, skew correction, and object detection using the ultralytics YOLO library. The model is loaded from a packaged resource, and results are displayed and saved as images. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code includes a file deletion step to remove temporary images after processing, which is normal for cleanup. Replacing pathlib's path class on all systems is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical image processing pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing and object detection pipeline without any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms are present. It functions as intended for its application, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
