{
  "purpose": "The code loads images, preprocesses them, performs object detection with YOLO, visualizes results, and manages file saving and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk, loads model weights via importlib.resources, and reads environment variables indirectly through model loading.",
  "sinks": "Saves processed images to disk, displays images via OpenCV windows, and deletes temporary image files after processing.",
  "flows": "Load image -> preprocess (resize, threshold, deskew) -> inference with YOLO -> visualize results -> save or display -> cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditionally replaces pathlib.PosixPath with WindowsPath on all systems, which is unusual but likely a cross-platform workaround rather than malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image preprocessing, skew correction, and object detection. No network activity or suspicious code patterns are present. The path class replacement is unconventional but not malicious. The model loading uses typical resource management. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. The logic is straightforward and aligns with benign image processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image recognition pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable anomaly is the path class replacement, which appears to be a compatibility fix rather than malicious obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate.",
