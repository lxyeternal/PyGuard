  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image recognition pipeline with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable anomaly is the path class replacement, which appears to be a compatibility fix rather than malicious obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate."
