      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic import of heavy ML libraries is typical for AI applications and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code content."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard database management utility with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the execute_custom_sql function, which could be exploited if exposed to untrusted input. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of approximately 0.2 to 0.3 is justified given the potential for misuse, but no active malicious behavior is detected."

The primary concerns relate to privacy and resource usage, not security. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The minor path replacement is a standard compatibility measure, not malicious obfuscation. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0.2 due to path class replacement, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the minor obfuscation but overall low risk."

The only notable anomaly is the path class replacement, which appears to be a compatibility fix rather than malicious obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate."
