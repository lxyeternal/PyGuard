{
  "purpose": "Re-export functions from the 'main' module for external use, facilitating API or package interface exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific functions from a local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are explicitly present; the code only re-exports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as this code only performs imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions from a local module '.main' and defines an __all__ list for module exports. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions appear to be related to database operations (checking, inserting, querying, updating, deleting), but without implementation details, their security implications cannot be fully assessed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Overall, this is a standard module interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical re-export module for database-related functions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
