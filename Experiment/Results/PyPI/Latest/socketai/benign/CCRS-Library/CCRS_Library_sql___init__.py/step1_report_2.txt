{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports functions from the 'main' module for database operations related to recognition records and mold info, serving as an interface for database management.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local module '.main' that handle database queries and updates.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the functions imported may act as sinks if they execute untrusted SQL, but the code here does not execute them directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on the usage of these imported functions elsewhere; here, no direct data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward module re-exporting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and then defines an __all__ list to specify public API functions. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscation present. The functions seem to be related to database operations, but without their implementations, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The structure is clean, and the code serves as an interface layer. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signals are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports functions from another module for database operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
