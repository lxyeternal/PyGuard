  "purpose": "Re-exporting database management functions for external use, likely as part of a package's __init__.py.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the .main module, no data input handling.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential concern if functions like execute_custom_sql are misused with untrusted input elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only re-exports functions without executing or processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization pattern, importing specific functions related to database operations and exposing them via __all__. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of functions like execute_custom_sql, which could be vulnerable if misused with untrusted input. However, this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The malware score is appropriately zero, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting potential misuse if the underlying functions are insecure, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score accounts for the potential misuse of functions like execute_custom_sql in the broader application context. Overall, it is safe based on this snippet.",
