  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code provided and the context.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a set of import statements from a local module `.main`, re-exported via an `__all__` list.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The functions relate to database operations: create, insert, query, update, delete, execute custom SQL, etc.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` module for exposing an API surface.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Re-exporting functions for external use.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard package initialization code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Interface for database management functions.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, straightforward re-export with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, module for API exposure.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no malicious behavior, just re-export.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Re-export of database functions.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still no suspicion.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just a minor potential concern about the risk score, which is reasonable given the nature of the functions.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on potential data flow.\n- **Analysis:** Notably mentions `execute_custom_sql`, which could be a vector for SQL injection if misused. However, since the code only imports and re-exports functions, the actual risk depends on their implementation.\n- **Key point:** The concern about untrusted input flowing into `execute_custom_sql` is valid, but the code fragment itself does not execute or process data directly.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk here is external; the code snippet itself appears safe, but the potential for misuse exists depending on how `execute_custom_sql` is used elsewhere.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0.2 (reflecting some concern), risk 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The only concern is the use of `execute_custom_sql`, which could be dangerous if not properly sanitized, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely import/export.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all cases, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with a slight increase in report 5 (0.2) due to potential SQL injection concerns.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard module re-exporting; no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `execute_custom_sql`, which could be dangerous if misused, but that depends on implementation outside this snippet.\n- Therefore, the risk score of 0.2 in report 5 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mainly due to the potential misuse of `execute_custom_sql`)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects the potential danger if the functions imported are misused, but the code snippet itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of the imported functions to fully assess security, especially for functions like `execute_custom_sql`.",
