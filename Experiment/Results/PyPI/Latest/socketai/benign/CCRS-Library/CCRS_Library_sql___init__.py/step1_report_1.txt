{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting functions from the 'main' module for external use, likely in a package's __init__.py file.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .main; the functions being imported serve as sources of potential data input if called elsewhere.",
  "targets": "Export list '__all__' indicating which functions are publicly accessible; no direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Functions imported serve as sources; their usage elsewhere (not shown) could be sinks if they handle untrusted input, but this code does not demonstrate such flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present. The code consists solely of import statements and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines an explicit list of public symbols. There is no execution of dynamic code, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard package initialization code for exposing module APIs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward re-export of functions for module exposure, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process or handle untrusted input directly, and the structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
