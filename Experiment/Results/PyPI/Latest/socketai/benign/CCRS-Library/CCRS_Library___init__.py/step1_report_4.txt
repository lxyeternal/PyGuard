{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a library that imports various modules related to system information, image processing, and machine learning components, primarily for internal or application use.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from relative paths (.sql, .sys_info, .TUI, .get_num, .clear_pic) and dynamically loads external packages (yolov5, ultralytics).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet. No sensitive data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and executes a function __load_all_imports() which loads yolov5 and ultralytics; no data flow from external sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports multiple internal modules, which is standard; the dynamic import of yolov5 and ultralytics suggests machine learning components, but no malicious activity such as code execution or data exfiltration is evident. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of import statements and a version/author metadata section. The __load_all_imports() function loads external ML libraries but does not execute or manipulate them beyond import. The code does not handle or process external data inputs, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or network activity. All imported modules appear to serve legitimate purposes related to system info, image processing, and ML.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module loader and metadata declaration with no apparent malicious intent. The dynamic imports of yolov5 and ultralytics suggest potential machine learning functionalities, but these are standard libraries in the context. No security risks or malware behavior are detected.",
