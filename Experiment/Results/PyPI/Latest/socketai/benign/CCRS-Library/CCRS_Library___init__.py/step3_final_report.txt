  "purpose": "This code module imports internal submodules related to system information, image processing, and numerical computations, and defines a function to load heavy AI libraries dynamically.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and the dynamic import function '__load_all_imports()' which loads 'yolov5' and 'ultralytics'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The dynamic import function loads external libraries when called; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward import and metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module with import statements and a simple function to load external AI libraries. No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The dynamic import pattern is common in AI projects for optional dependencies. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic import of heavy ML libraries is typical for AI applications and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
