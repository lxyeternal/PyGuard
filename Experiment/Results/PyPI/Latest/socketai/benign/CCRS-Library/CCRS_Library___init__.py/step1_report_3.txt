{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a library initialization module that imports various submodules and packages, and provides metadata about the package version, author, and included components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.sql, .sys_info, .TUI, .get_num, .clear_pic) and dynamic imports within __load_all_imports() for yolov5 and ultralytics.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that directly leak or manipulate data based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules and dynamic imports suggest flow of code execution, but no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The function __load_all_imports() loads heavy third-party libraries (yolov5, ultralytics) dynamically, which could be used maliciously if misused, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the library with metadata and imports. The import statements are standard, and the dynamic import function loads known AI libraries without any malicious indicators. There are no suspicious functions, data leaks, or backdoors present. The presence of AI libraries like yolov5 and ultralytics may be for legitimate image/video processing features. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library setup with imports and metadata. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities evident. The only minor point is the dynamic import of AI libraries, which is common in machine learning projects and not inherently malicious.",
