{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various internal and external packages, defines metadata, and provides a function to load additional libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.sql, .sys_info, .TUI, .get_num, .clear_pic), built-in package imports (yolov5, ultralytics).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data outputs, network communications, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes imports and metadata, with no explicit data flow or handling of untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The function __load_all_imports() simply imports third-party libraries without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily importing modules and defining metadata. The __load_all_imports() function loads specific third-party libraries (yolov5, ultralytics) which are common in AI/ML applications; these imports are standard and have no malicious intent. No input handling, network communications, or dynamic code execution is present. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, it appears to be a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module primarily used for importing dependencies and defining metadata. There are no indications of malware, malicious activity, or security risks based on the provided content.",
