{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a library module that imports various submodules and functions, and defines metadata about the package version, author, and help information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.sql, .sys_info, .TUI, .get_num, .clear_pic) and dynamic imports of yolov5 and ultralytics within __load_all_imports().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and functions but does not show any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the dynamic import of yolov5 and ultralytics within a function, which might suggest optional or late loading; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a package initializer or metadata container, importing specific modules and functions. It defines version and author info, along with a help message. The dynamic imports in __load_all_imports() are benign and possibly intended to avoid load time overhead or to load heavy dependencies only when needed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or code injection. All imported modules seem related to computer vision, system info, and image processing, which are consistent with legitimate use cases. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup or initialization script with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the dynamic import function, which is standard practice for optional dependencies. Overall, the code appears safe.",
