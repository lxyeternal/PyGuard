  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements, metadata definitions, and a simple function to load heavy third-party libraries (`yolov5`, `ultralytics`).\n- No data processing, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted inputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The dynamic import pattern is common in projects that want to load dependencies only when needed, especially for large ML libraries.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the analysis.\n- They correctly identify the lack of suspicious activity, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The mention of dynamic imports is noted as potentially unusual but not malicious.\n\n**3. Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are mostly around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which seems reasonable.\n\n**4. Potential for Higher Risk or Malware:**\n- The only point of concern could be the dynamic import of heavy ML libraries, which, if misused, could be part of malicious activities like model inference or data exfiltration. However, in this context, there's no evidence of such misuse.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.\n\n**5. Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating strong agreement among the reports.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, the overall security posture appears safe.\n- The only minor note is that the dynamic import of large ML libraries could be exploited if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but this cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to the potential misuse of ML libraries, but no evidence here)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard module loader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic import pattern is common and benign in this context. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe as presented.",
