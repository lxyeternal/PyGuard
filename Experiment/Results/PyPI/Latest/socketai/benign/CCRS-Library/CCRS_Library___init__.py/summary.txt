  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic import of heavy ML libraries is typical for AI applications and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code content."
