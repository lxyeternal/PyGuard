  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on import statements from a local module `.main`.\n- The imported functions are named in a way that suggests they perform system and network information retrieval.\n- There are no direct data flows, network communication, or code execution shown.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code snippets are straightforward and typical for system monitoring modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Import system/network info functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity is indicated. The securityRisk is low, perhaps due to the nature of system info functions which could be misused if combined with other code, but not in this snippet.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature of the code. I suggest lowering it to 0.1 or 0, unless there's context outside this snippet.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The high confidence is justified.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import of system/network functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Final Evaluation:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that these are benign import statements.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, as expected.\n- The securityRisk scores are slightly inconsistent; only the first report assigns a value of 0.2, which seems unjustified given the benign code. I recommend lowering it to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that these snippets are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in this context)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The only adjustment I suggest is reducing the `securityRisk` score in Report 1 from 0.2 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that these import statements are benign, with no malicious or security risks evident.",
