  "purpose": "Import statements for system and network information functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the '.main' module, importing functions like get_system_info, get_ip, get_system_uptime, send_sysInfo, get_network_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only import statements are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module, importing functions related to system and network info. No data transmission, code execution, or suspicious activity is evident. The functions' names suggest legitimate purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), but given the benign nature, it can be conservatively set to 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1). Overall, the code appears benign with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a benign set of import statements from a local module, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0. The overall evaluation indicates no security threat.",
