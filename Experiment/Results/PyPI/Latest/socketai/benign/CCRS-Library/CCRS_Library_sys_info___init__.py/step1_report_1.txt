{
  "purpose": "Import functions related to system information retrieval and network info from the local module for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module .main, specifically functions that gather system and network data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code snippet; potential sinks could be in the imported functions if they perform data transmission or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions that could potentially be used to gather and possibly transmit system or network data, but no explicit data flow or transmission is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded credentials are visible in these import statements. The functions' implementation is not shown, so their behavior cannot be assessed.",
  "analysis": "This code solely consists of import statements from a local module, importing functions that likely relate to system and network information retrieval. There are no apparent malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code within these imports. Without the implementation details of these functions, it’s impossible to identify malicious behavior. The imports appear to be standard and typical for system management or monitoring tools.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard for a module that gathers system and network information, assuming the imported functions are legitimate and secure.",
