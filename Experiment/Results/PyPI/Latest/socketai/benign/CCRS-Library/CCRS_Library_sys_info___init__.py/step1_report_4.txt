{
  "purpose": "Importing specific functions from the local module '.main' to be used elsewhere, likely for system information retrieval and network operations.",
  "sources": "Functions imported from the '.main' module: get_system_info, get_ip, get_system_uptime, send_sysInfo, get_network_info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data are present in these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as this snippet only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The code simply imports functions; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module. These functions suggest capabilities related to system and network info gathering. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code execution. The structure is straightforward, and the import statements are typical for modular Python code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is simple and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement block importing functions related to system and network information. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these lines alone.",
