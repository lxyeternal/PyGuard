  "purpose": "Set environment mode and server host URL",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting ENV and HOST variables",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data processing or external data outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded environment setting and URL, but this is common practice in configuration files",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two string variables, ENV and HOST, with hardcoded values indicating development environment and local server URL. There are no input reads, data processing, or external communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. This appears to be standard configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple configuration assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
