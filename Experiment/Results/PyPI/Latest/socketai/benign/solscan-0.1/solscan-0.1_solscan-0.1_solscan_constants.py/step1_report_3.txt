  "purpose": "Configuration settings for environment and host URL",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting ENV and HOST variables",
  "sinks": "None; variables are stored locally, no data transmission or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as these are static assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded environment and host values, which could be a concern if sensitive information were present, but nothing malicious or suspicious is present here",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple variable assignments defining environment and host URL. These are static strings, with no input handling, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The hardcoded localhost URL suggests a development setup, which is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern could be hardcoded environment values, but this is typical for development settings and not malicious.",
