  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as simple variable assignments setting environment and host URL to static strings.\n   - The original code matches these descriptions.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic input, external data handling, or malicious code.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as straightforward configuration.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly note that hardcoded values are typical in development environments and not inherently malicious.\n   - **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is purely configuration with no malicious or risky behavior, high risk scores are unjustified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - The code shows no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the hardcoded nature but dismiss it as typical for development.\n   - No overinterpretation is present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated; straightforward static code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple configuration snippet used in development, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the issues as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and is supported by the detailed review.",
