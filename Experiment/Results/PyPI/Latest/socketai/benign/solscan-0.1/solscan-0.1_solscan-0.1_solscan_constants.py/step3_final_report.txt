  "purpose": "Simple configuration variables setting environment and host URL for development.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string values to ENV and HOST variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed strings to variables ENV and HOST, typical for development setup. No dynamic input, external data, or executable logic exists. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The hardcoded localhost URL and environment are standard in development contexts. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration snippet for development purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
