  "purpose": "Configuration settings for environment and host URL",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string values to variables ENV and HOST",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no untrusted data sources or outputs",
  "flows": "None, since the code only assigns static values without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code contains simple variable assignments with static strings",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables with fixed string values representing environment and host URL. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution or malicious logic present. The variables are typical configuration parameters. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply assigns static values to variables for environment and host URL.",
