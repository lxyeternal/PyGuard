  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing configuration and performing security scans on blockchain projects or blocks.",
  "sources": "CLI input options for token, project URL, branch, name, skip paths, contract address, chain, platform.",
  "sinks": "Methods like Config.add_update_config, Scan.project_scan, Scan.block_scan that may process sensitive input data.",
  "flows": "User inputs from CLI are passed to configuration methods or scanning methods; no data is transmitted externally within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or backdoors are present. Use of standard libraries and clear CLI commands. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines CLI commands using the 'click' library, handling configuration updates and scans for blockchain data. Input validation checks are in place for required options. The code relies on external modules 'solscan.config' and 'solscan.scan' for core functionality, which are not included here. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are evident. The structure is straightforward, with proper command grouping and validation. No indications of suspicious or malicious activities are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI application for managing blockchain scans, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. It mainly handles user input and delegates processing to external modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
