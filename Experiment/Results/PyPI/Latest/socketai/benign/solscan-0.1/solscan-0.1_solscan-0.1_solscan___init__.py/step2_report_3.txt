  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe this code as a straightforward CLI wrapper for configuration management and blockchain scans.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on external modules (`Config`, `Scan`) whose implementations are not provided; thus, potential risks depend on those modules.\n- All reports assign very low malware scores (0), with some noting the absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Security risk scores are also low (mostly around 0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign appearance of the CLI wrapper itself.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code appears correct, with proper input validation and no evident vulnerabilities or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are visible.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the core security concerns depend on the external modules (`Config`, `Scan`) which are not included here. No flawed reasoning is apparent.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of this CLI wrapper.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since the code itself does not perform any malicious actions, higher scores are unwarranted. The only concern would be if the external modules are malicious, but that cannot be assessed from this code snippet alone.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  No signs of malware—no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is purely orchestrating CLI commands.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond what is visible. They correctly note that the core functionality depends on external modules.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's apparent safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mostly due to external dependencies and potential misconfiguration if external modules are malicious)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The core security depends on the external modules (`Config`, `Scan`). If those modules are malicious or contain vulnerabilities, the risk could be higher, but from this code alone, there's no indication of that.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible.\n- The code follows standard CLI patterns, with proper validation and no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the overall malware score should remain at 0**, **obfuscated at 0**, and **security risk should be minimal (~0.1–0.2)**. The main caveat is the security posture of the external modules, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, given the code's nature)\n\nThis code appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
