{
  "purpose": "The code aims to translate error messages into a specified language using the GoogleTranslator API.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values via config.Config().get_config_value('error_language') and input text passed to the translate method.",
  "targets": "The translation is performed on the keys and values of the input text dictionary within the translate method.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the target language, then for each key in the input text, it translates the key and corresponding value, storing them in a new dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated instantiation of GoogleTranslator inside a loop could lead to unnecessary resource consumption; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious API usage are evident; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with a configurable language setting, defaulting to English. The translate method translates each key and value in the provided text dictionary, catching exceptions to prevent crashes. The use of the deep_translator library for translation is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious API usage. The repeated instantiation of GoogleTranslator objects within the loop could be inefficient but not malicious. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs translation of error messages based on configuration, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility component with a minor efficiency concern.",
