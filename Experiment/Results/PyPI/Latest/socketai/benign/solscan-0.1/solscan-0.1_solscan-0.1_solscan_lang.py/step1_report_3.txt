{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for translating error messages into a specified language, likely for internationalization or user interface purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via config.Config().get_config_value(\"error_language\") and input text passed to the translate() method.",
  "sinks": "The translate() method calls GoogleTranslator.translate() for each key and value, which involves external API calls, but no data leaks or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input text and configuration data are used as sources; external API calls (GoogleTranslator) are made to translate text, with results stored in a new dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed. The class lacks actual implementation for get_translation_language() but does not perform harmful actions. No hardcoded credentials are visible. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to translate error message keys and values into the user's preferred language using an external API. It catches exceptions broadly, which may hide errors but is not inherently malicious. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of external translation service is common and benign in this context. No malicious side effects are evident. The code does not perform any suspicious operations beyond translation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation for translating error messages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external translation API and handles exceptions broadly, which is acceptable in this context. No security issues or malware are detected.",
