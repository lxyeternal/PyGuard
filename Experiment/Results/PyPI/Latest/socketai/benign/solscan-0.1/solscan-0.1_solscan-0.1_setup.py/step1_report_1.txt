{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'solscan', including metadata, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package discovery via find_packages(), and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the entry point 'solscan' could be executed as a console script, but no malicious code execution is directly visible.",
  "flows": "Installation process reads dependencies, and the console script points to solscan.__init__:solscan, which is not provided but assumed to be a standard entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. All code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules and calls setup() with metadata, dependencies, and entry point configuration. Dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions, which is common for reproducibility. The entry point defines a console script that invokes 'solscan' from the module, but no malicious behavior or suspicious code is present in this configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and a console script entry point. No anomalies, malware, or security risks detected.",
