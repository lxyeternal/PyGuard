{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'solscan', intended to provide smart contract auditing capabilities.",
  "sources": "None in the provided code; the code only includes package metadata and dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the script only declares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard setup configuration with explicit dependency versions and entry point definition.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools, with explicit dependencies, package discovery, and entry point declaration. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are specified with exact versions, reducing risk of supply chain attacks via dependency tampering. No code injection, network activity, or sensitive data handling is evident. The only notable feature is the 'entry_points' which defines a console script, but this is standard in Python package setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
