  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, description, url, entry_points, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data handling or external data sources; only package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the script only declares package info and dependencies, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, dependencies are explicitly versioned, entry point is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies with fixed versions, and an entry point for a CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure practices. The dependencies are common and explicitly versioned, reducing supply chain risks. The entry point references a function in the package, which is standard for CLI tools; without the implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code does not execute any runtime logic beyond package configuration. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal. The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a legitimate, benign package configuration script with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0, and the security risk is very low. No modifications are necessary.",
