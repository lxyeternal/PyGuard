  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'solscan'. It configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, version, description, URL, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the script does not process user input or external data during runtime.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script solely defines static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the dependencies are standard Python packages. The version specifications are strict, but typical in package setups.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package configuration. It specifies dependencies, package discovery, and entry points for command-line execution. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are common, and the script does not perform any runtime actions or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears legitimate and safe, serving the purpose of packaging a Python project. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
