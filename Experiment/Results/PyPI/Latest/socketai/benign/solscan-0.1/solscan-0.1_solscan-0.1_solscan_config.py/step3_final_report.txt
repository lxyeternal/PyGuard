  "purpose": "Manage configuration stored in a YAML file (~/.solscan.yml), including reading, updating, and retrieving tokens and version info.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, input parameters for token and error_language, YAML load_all method.",
  "sinks": "Writing YAML content to the config file, potentially injecting malicious input if token or error_language contain malicious YAML syntax.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token/error_language) flow into string interpolation to generate YAML string, then written to file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation to generate YAML content without sanitization, which could lead to YAML injection if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration via YAML files, with functions to load, retrieve, and update config data. It uses string interpolation to construct YAML content dynamically, which could be exploited if malicious input is provided. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The YAML loading method loads all documents but only returns the last, which may be unintended but not security-related. The main concern is input sanitization; however, this is a common risk rather than malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0 across reports, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting potential injection risk but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary security concern is input sanitization to prevent YAML injection, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
