  "purpose": "Manage configuration data for solscan, including loading, updating, and retrieving tokens from a YAML configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file at path specified by SOLSCAN_ENV_PATH ('~/.solscan.yml').",
  "sinks": "Writing to the same configuration file, potentially overwriting data with user-provided input (token and error_language).",
  "flows": "Load YAML from file -> Retrieve or update token/error_language -> Write back to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or malicious code detected. YAML content is constructed dynamically from potentially external data but appears straightforward. No network operations, code injection, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O operations for YAML configuration, with methods to load, update, and retrieve tokens. It uses standard libraries and safe file handling. The token addition/update method constructs YAML content from input parameters and existing config data, then writes to a local file. No network calls or system modifications are present. Potential risk exists if untrusted input is used directly for token, but this is typical for config management and not inherently malicious. The code does not include any malicious payloads or backdoors, nor does it perform any suspicious actions beyond configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration management module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles configuration data safely and straightforwardly, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
