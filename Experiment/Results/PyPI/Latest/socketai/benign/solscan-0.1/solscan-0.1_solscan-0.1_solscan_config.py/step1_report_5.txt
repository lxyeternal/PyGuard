  "purpose": "Manage configuration data stored in a YAML file, including reading, updating, and retrieving tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading the YAML configuration file at SOLSCAN_ENV_PATH; loading YAML data from the file.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated YAML data back to the configuration file; echoing messages via click.echo.",
  "flows": "load_yaml() reads data from SOLSCAN_ENV_PATH; get_token_from_config() retrieves 'token' from loaded data; add_update_config() writes YAML string to SOLSCAN_ENV_PATH.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in the code; no suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads and writes YAML configuration data from a file located at a fixed path in the user's home directory. It performs basic file operations, such as reading configuration data and updating tokens. The use of 'click' for user feedback and 'ruamel.yaml' for YAML parsing is standard. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, remote code execution, or data exfiltration, are present. The functions appear to handle configuration management securely, with no suspicious data flow or external calls that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration handler without malicious intent. It reads and writes data to a fixed file path, manages tokens, and provides user feedback. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
