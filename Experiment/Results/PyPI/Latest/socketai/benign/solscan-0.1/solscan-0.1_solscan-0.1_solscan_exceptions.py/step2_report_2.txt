  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Defines three custom exception classes: `TokenNotFound`, `ScanFailed`, and `HostNotReachable`.\n- Each class constructs an error payload with message and error code.\n- Uses `ErrorLanguageMapper().translate()` to localize or translate error messages.\n- Passes the translated payload to the base `Exception` class.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues & Logical Validity:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward error handling with localization support. No malicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:**  \n  The code structure is standard and free of evident bugs or security flaws. The use of static methods for error codes/messages is conventional.\n\n- **Malware or suspicious activity:**  \n  No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The use of `ErrorLanguageMapper` appears to be for localization, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0` and very low or zero `securityRisk`. This aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes defining custom exceptions with translation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.  \n  **Score seems appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, clear description.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.  \n  **Score seems appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Emphasizes static strings and translation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No dynamic code, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.2`.  \n  The `securityRisk` is slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity, this is likely an overestimation.  \n  **Recommendation:** Lower `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no evident risk.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on internationalization.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.  \n  **Score seems appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Contextualizes as part of larger application, likely blockchain or token scanning.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0.1`.  \n  Slightly above zero, but again, no evidence of actual risk.  \n  **Recommendation:** Reduce to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports correctly identify malware as 0, which is justified.\n\n### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation.\n\n### Risk Scores:\n- Most are 0 or very close to zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust `securityRisk` scores for reports 3 and 5 to 0**, as no vulnerabilities or risks are present.\n- **Maintain `malware` at 0** across all reports.\n- **Maintain `obfuscated` at 0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with localization support, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Slight overestimation of `securityRisk` in some reports; recommend setting it to 0.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that in supply chain security, even benign-looking code can be malicious if combined with other components or if the `ErrorLanguageMapper` is compromised. But based solely on this snippet, the assessment is that the code is safe.",
