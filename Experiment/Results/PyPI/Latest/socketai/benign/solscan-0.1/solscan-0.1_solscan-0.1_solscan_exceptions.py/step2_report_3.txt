  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exceptions with translation support; no malicious activity observed.\n- **Assessment:** The code matches the description. No input/output, no suspicious behavior, straightforward error classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard error classes with translation, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confirmed.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Custom exceptions with static messages and translation; no secrets or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code. The only note is the securityRisk score of 0.2, which is slightly above zero.\n- **Analysis of securityRisk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, a score of 0.2 might be slightly high. The report states no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Adjust securityRisk to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard internationalization support, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code. No external data sources or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with localization; no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The risk score is 0.1, which is very low.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is, or possibly reduce to 0, since no security issues are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Adjust risk score to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; remains at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports, but given the straightforward nature of the code, all should be 0.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is standard error handling with localization, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The translation mechanism is typical for internationalization, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- Slight adjustments: set `securityRisk` to 0 where it was 0.2 or 0.1.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation present.\n\n**End of analysis.**",
