  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with translation support.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or send data to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ErrorLanguageMapper for translating error payloads; no malicious code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: TokenNotFound, ScanFailed, and HostNotReachable. Each class constructs an error payload, potentially translates it via ErrorLanguageMapper, and then raises the exception with this payload. No input reading, external data handling, or network activity is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of a translation mapper suggests localization, not malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be standard error handling with localization support, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with localization, showing no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
