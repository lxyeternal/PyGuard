{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with localized error messages for use in a larger application, likely related to blockchain or token scanning.",
  "sources": "Error message generation within exception classes, static methods returning error codes/messages, usage of external ErrorLanguageMapper for translation.",
  "sinks": "Exception initialization that ultimately raises translated error payloads; no external data input sources or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Error message or code generation (source) -> translation via ErrorLanguageMapper -> exception raising (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of translation mechanism (ErrorLanguageMapper) suggests localization, but no suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or unsafe code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with methods to retrieve error codes and messages, which are then translated via an external ErrorLanguageMapper before being passed to the parent Exception class. There are no data input sources, network calls, or untrusted data flows. The code primarily manages error messaging. The ErrorLanguageMapper usage indicates localization but does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception handling with localization support. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears safe and straightforward, intended for error management in a larger system.",
