  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code defines three custom exceptions: `TokenNotFound`, `ScanFailed`, and `HostNotReachable`.\n- Each exception constructs an error payload with a message and error code, then translates it via `ErrorLanguageMapper()`.\n- The code is static, with no input/output handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of translation suggests localization, not malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of all reported classes and methods:** All classes and static methods are correctly implemented.\n- **Error payload construction and translation:** Consistent across all classes.\n- **No external data or input handling:** The code does not read from or write to external sources.\n- **No malware or malicious behavior observed:** The code only constructs and raises exceptions with translated messages.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code as per the reports.** The code is straightforward, standard error handling with localization support.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that the code is standard and does not contain malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows from untrusted sources, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The mention of `ErrorLanguageMapper()` as a localization tool is accurate and not suspicious.\n\n**No significant flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.** They are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0.0`, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0.0`, consistent with the straightforward static code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly `0.0` or very low (`0.1`), which is reasonable. The only slightly higher score (`0.2` or `0.1`) is justified by the potential for localization to be misused if malicious, but here it is standard.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code’s purpose is to define error classes, not to perform any logic that could be exploited.\n- The use of `ErrorLanguageMapper()` is typical for localization and does not introduce security risks.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified based solely on this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (clear, static code)\n- **Risk:** **0.0 to 0.1** (minimal, mostly standard error handling)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with localization support. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are evident. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
