  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with internationalization support",
  "sources": "Constants and static methods providing error messages and codes, ErrorLanguageMapper().translate() method",
  "sinks": "super().__init__(err_payload) passing translated error messages to the Exception base class",
  "flows": "Error message and code generation -> translation via ErrorLanguageMapper() -> passing to Exception constructor",
  "anomalies": "Use of static methods for error codes/messages is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with static methods returning error codes and messages. Each class constructs an error payload, translates it using ErrorLanguageMapper, and passes it to the base Exception class. The design is straightforward and typical for structured error handling. No input/output sources or untrusted data flows are evident beyond standard exception message creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The use of translation indicates support for multiple languages but does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with internationalization support. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
