  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes that generate error payloads, translate them via `ErrorLanguageMapper()`, and then raise exceptions with these payloads.\n- No input reading, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- The use of `ErrorLanguageMapper()` suggests localization or message translation, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The logic is straightforward and typical for error handling in a multi-language application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of code logic is consistent with the reports.** The code matches the described purpose: defining custom exceptions with translation support.\n- **No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.** The code does not perform any network I/O, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Error payloads are constructed statically or via static methods, with translation for localization.**\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Minor design considerations:**\n  - The use of static methods for error codes/messages is acceptable but could be more flexible if these were class variables or properties, allowing easier extension.\n  - The `ErrorLanguageMapper().translate()` is called on static payloads; if `ErrorLanguageMapper()` is stateless, instantiating it each time might be inefficient. However, this is not a security concern.\n- **No actual issues or vulnerabilities** are detected.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; no malicious activity. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; standard error classes. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   | Slightly higher risk score due to translation, but still standard. No vulnerabilities. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Correct; straightforward. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   | Correct; minimal risk, no malicious behavior. |\n\nThe overall risk scores are appropriate, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to the translation mechanism, but no actual security risk exists.\n\n### Potential inaccuracies or overestimations:\n\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low, which is appropriate.\n- The higher scores in some reports (0.2, 0.1) are acceptable given the translation mechanism, but since it does not introduce vulnerabilities, these could be set to 0 for stricter security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with localization support. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.**\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 across all reports, or at most 0.1 for the translation aspect, but given no vulnerabilities, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| All     | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard error handling with localization, and does not pose any security risks or malicious threats.",
