  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Defines three custom exception classes: `TokenNotFound`, `ScanFailed`, and `HostNotReachable`.\n- Each class constructs an error payload with message and error code.\n- Uses `ErrorLanguageMapper().translate()` to localize or translate the payload.\n- Passes the translated payload to the base `Exception` class.\n- No input reading, network activity, or data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.\n- The purpose appears to be structured error handling with localization support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no evident bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns. The use of static methods for error codes/messages and a translation class is standard for localization.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in report logic:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is primarily error handling with localization. They note the absence of data flows, external input, or suspicious activity. No flaws or mistakes are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are also low, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n- **Malware scores justification:**  \n  The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard error handling with localization.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No overestimation or underestimation is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  **Should be 0.** The code is standard exception handling with localization; no malware or malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  **Should be 0.** The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  **Should be very low, likely 0 or close to 0.** No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  The only minor consideration is the use of `ErrorLanguageMapper().translate()`. If this function were malicious or insecure, it could pose a risk. However, based on the reports, it appears to be a standard localization utility, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 if considering localization mechanisms)\n\n- **Overall conclusion:**  \n  The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions with localization support. There is no evidence of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**In summary, my estimated scores are:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, standard, and safe.",
