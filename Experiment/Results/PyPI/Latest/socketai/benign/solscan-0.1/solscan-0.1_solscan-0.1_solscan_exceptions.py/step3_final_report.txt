  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with localized error messages, constructing payloads and translating them before raising exceptions.",
  "sources": "Static error message strings and static methods providing error codes/messages.",
  "sinks": "The translated payloads are passed to the Exception constructor; no external data or untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "Error payloads are constructed, translated via ErrorLanguageMapper, then passed to super().__init__() as exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static messages and translation calls. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard custom exceptions with localization support. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of ErrorLanguageMapper().translate() appears to be for message localization, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The error payloads are static or derived from static methods, and the translation is likely benign. The overall structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign implementation of localized error classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, aligning with the analysis.",
