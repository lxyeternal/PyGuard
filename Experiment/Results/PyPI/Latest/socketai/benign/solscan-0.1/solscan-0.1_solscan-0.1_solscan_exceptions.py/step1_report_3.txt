  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with error messages and error codes, translating messages via ErrorLanguageMapper.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for error messages, error codes, and calls ErrorLanguageMapper().translate()",
  "sinks": "The translated error payloads are passed to the superclass Exception, potentially used in error handling/logging",
  "flows": "Static strings and error codes are assembled into payloads, translated, then passed as exception messages",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscation, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions with static error messages and error codes, translating messages via an external mapper. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or be exploited, and no unusual code constructs. The translation step is presumably for localization and does not introduce security risks. The overall structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
