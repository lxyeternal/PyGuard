  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with translated error messages for logging and error handling.",
  "sources": "Error message construction and translation via ErrorLanguageMapper()",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(err_payload) which may pass data to exception handling mechanisms",
  "flows": "Error message and code data generated in static methods and constructor, then translated and passed to super().__init__()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for token not found, scan failure, and host unreachable errors. These classes generate error payloads, translate them via ErrorLanguageMapper, and pass them to the base Exception class. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external data flows, no obfuscated or malicious code. The use of ErrorLanguageMapper suggests localization or error message translation, which is standard practice. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be legitimate error handling code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard error class definitions with message translation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
