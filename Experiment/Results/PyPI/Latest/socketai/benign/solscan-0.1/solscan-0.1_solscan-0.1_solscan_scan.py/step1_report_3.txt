{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for performing project and block scans by sending HTTP POST requests to specific API endpoints, with configurable parameters such as project details, contract details, and tokens.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters (project_url, project_branch, project_name, rescan, skip_file_paths, token, contract_address, contract_chain, contract_platform), environment/config (Config.get_token_from_config), and the request responses.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are the requests.post calls which send data over the network, and the click.echo calls which output JSON responses. The requests are made with headers that include tokens, and responses are parsed as JSON.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through local variable constructions (body dictionaries), into requests.post calls with headers and JSON bodies, and responses are processed for success or failure. Tokens may originate from configuration or be provided directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Usage of environment/config for tokens is standard. No code injection or malicious data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly structures API requests for project and block scans, using parameters and configuration. It handles exceptions for network errors and failed responses properly. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious logic. It relies on external Config for tokens and makes standard requests; no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate API client wrapper with standard network request handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided content. It performs expected operations without suspicious activity.",
