  "purpose": "This code defines a class for performing project and block scans via HTTP requests to specific endpoints, utilizing configuration tokens and handling responses.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: project_url, project_branch, project_name, skip_file_paths, token, contract_address, contract_chain, contract_platform, rescan.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include requests.post calls with untrusted data in JSON bodies, and click.echo for outputting JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to the request bodies, which are sent over HTTP; responses are parsed as JSON and output via click.echo.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs straightforward HTTP requests and response handling with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs request bodies with input parameters and sends POST requests to specified endpoints, using tokens obtained from configuration. It handles network exceptions and raises custom exceptions for errors. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation, unusual control flow, or secret manipulation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for interfacing with external scan services, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It handles data securely in transit, and there are no indications of malicious intent.",
