{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for initiating project and block scans via HTTP POST requests to specified endpoints, with some configuration management and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration token via Config.get_token_from_config(), input parameters for project and block scans, environment variables indirectly through Config",
  "sinks": "requests.post calls that send data over the network, response.json() for parsing responses, raising exceptions that may trigger external error handling",
  "flows": "Input parameters → request body → requests.post (network sink) → response.json() → output or exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious URL usage; no obfuscated code; no evidence of malicious code injection or unusual control flow; error handling appears standard; no dynamic code execution or suspicious network calls",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to perform HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints, passing scan parameters securely via headers and JSON body. Token retrieval is from a configuration utility, not hardcoded. Error handling covers network exceptions and response status codes, raising specific exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears standard for a client wrapper around an API, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client for initiating scans, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It relies on external configuration for sensitive tokens, and its network interactions are standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
