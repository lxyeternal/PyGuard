  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear, detailed, and technical. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Uses standard libraries, proper error handling, and external configuration for tokens.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to network interactions, which are standard.\n- **Assessment:** The report is thorough and consistent. No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward API calls, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and proper handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low, standard network operations.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent, no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, proper token management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Clear, legitimate API client code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard API requests, no signs of malicious activity, proper handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still within low risk, perhaps due to network communication.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, straightforward API client code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, typical for network-based API clients.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard API client wrapper for initiating scans, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), but these are just general low risks associated with network communication, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the low but non-zero scores, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1**. This accounts for the minimal security concern of network interactions but does not indicate any significant threat.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports do not mention any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code relies on external configuration for tokens, which is standard practice.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | **0**       |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**       |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1**     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence provided and the detailed analysis of each report.",
