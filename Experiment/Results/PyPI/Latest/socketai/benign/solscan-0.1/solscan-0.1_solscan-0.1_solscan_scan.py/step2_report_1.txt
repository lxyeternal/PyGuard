  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a client for initiating scans, token from config.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, response parsing, error raising.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; no suspicious URL or code obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client; no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope, emphasizing straightforward request handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates standard API request patterns.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment, standard API client.\n- No suspicious code or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with prior findings, no malicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2), but still minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only potential concern could be the handling of tokens or data in transit. However, tokens are retrieved from a configuration utility, and requests are made over HTTPS (implied, as standard for such APIs). No hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL usage.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code detected.  \n  Security risk scores are very low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature.  \n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  The reports are consistent and cautious, not assuming malicious activity without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate. The current scores of 0.1-0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The code relies on external configuration for tokens, which is standard practice.\n- Network interactions are typical for an API client.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Recommended Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious code or payloads detected.                        |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | No obfuscation present.                                         |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 to 0.2          | Very low; standard API client with proper error handling.     |\n\n**Overall, the code appears secure, benign, and free of malicious intent.**",
