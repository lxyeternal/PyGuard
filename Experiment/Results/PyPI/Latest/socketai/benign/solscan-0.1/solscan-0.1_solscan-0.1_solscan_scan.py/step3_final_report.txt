  "purpose": "A client for initiating project and block scans via API endpoints, managing tokens from configuration, and handling responses and errors.",
  "sources": "Retrieving tokens from configuration, user input parameters for scan details, network requests to API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API URLs, response parsing, raising exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> make request body -> send POST request -> receive response -> parse JSON -> handle success or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious URL patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper for scan operations, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It retrieves tokens from external configuration, constructs request bodies, and makes POST requests to predefined URLs. Error handling is implemented for network issues and unsuccessful responses. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's design and behavior are typical for such API interactions, with no suspicious patterns or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a standard API client for scan operations, handling errors appropriately. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or high security threat are detected.",
