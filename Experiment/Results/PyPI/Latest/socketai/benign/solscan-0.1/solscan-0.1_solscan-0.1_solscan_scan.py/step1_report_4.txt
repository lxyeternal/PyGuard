{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods to perform project and block scans by sending HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints with relevant data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters (project_url, project_branch, project_name, skip_file_paths, token, contract_address, contract_chain, contract_platform, rescan) and configuration files via Config.get_token_from_config().",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.post to send data to external URLs; response.json() processes the server's response; click.echo outputs data to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs and configuration retrieval into request bodies, which are then sent over the network; responses are processed and potentially output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data detected; no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variables; error handling is straightforward; no suspicious URL usage beyond expected API endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests with input data, handles exceptions for network issues, and outputs responses. No indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The code does not include any suspicious behaviors such as data theft, system modifications, or network anomalies. It relies on external configurations for tokens, which is typical. No evidence of malware or malicious intent in the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for interfacing with a scanning service. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It functions as expected for a secure API client module.",
