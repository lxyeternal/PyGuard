{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'mcp' module from 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' and defining a placeholder function for customizing prompts.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'mcp' from an external module; function 'customize_prompt' returning None.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily importing and defining a simple function with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'customize_prompt' returns None without implementing any logic; unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module 'mcp' and defines a decorator-based function intended to customize prompts. The function currently returns None, serving as a placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The import statement is standard, and the code structure is minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign snippet setting up a prompt customization hook with no malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger framework or application with no evident security issues.",
