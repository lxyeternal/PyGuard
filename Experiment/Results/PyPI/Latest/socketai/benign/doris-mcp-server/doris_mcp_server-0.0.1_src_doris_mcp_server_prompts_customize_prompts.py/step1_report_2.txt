  "purpose": "Importing a module from 'doris_mcp_server' and defining a decorator function for customizing prompts.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp' and the function 'customize_prompt()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports a module and defines a function that returns None.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'customize_prompt' is defined but returns None, which may indicate incomplete implementation or placeholder code; no suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, likely part of a larger system, and defines a decorator function 'customize_prompt' that returns None. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The placeholder function could be part of a legitimate customization process. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a placeholder or part of a larger system setup. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
