  "purpose": "Import 'mcp' from 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' and decorate a function intended for prompt customization.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app', and the decorator '@mcp.prompt()' applied to 'customize_prompt'.",
  "sinks": "The decorator '@mcp.prompt()' could potentially modify or execute code at decoration time, especially if 'prompt()' internally executes dynamic code or processes external input.",
  "flows": "The import source provides 'mcp', which is used as a decorator; the decorator applies to 'customize_prompt', which returns None. The flow involves the decorator potentially influencing the function's behavior or execution environment.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'customize_prompt' is a placeholder returning None, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of a decorator from an external module could be benign or risky depending on 'prompt()' implementation, but no evidence indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and applies a decorator that could modify or generate prompts dynamically. The function itself is a placeholder, indicating configuration or extension point. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The potential risk hinges on the internal behavior of 'mcp.prompt()', which is unknown; however, in the absence of evidence, the code appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for prompt customization with a decorator that could, in theory, execute or modify behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The low malware and risk scores are justified and appropriate given the evidence.",
