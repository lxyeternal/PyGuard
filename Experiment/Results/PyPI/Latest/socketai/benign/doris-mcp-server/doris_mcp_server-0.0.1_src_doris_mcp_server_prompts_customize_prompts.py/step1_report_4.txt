  "purpose": "Importing a module 'mcp' from 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' and defining a decorator function 'customize_prompt' that returns None.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' and the definition of 'customize_prompt' function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs or untrusted data flows evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and defines a function that returns None.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The function does nothing but return None and serves as a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific module and defines a decorator function that returns None, likely intended as a placeholder for customization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import appears standard for a modular Python application, and the function's purpose is unclear but benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import and placeholder function with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
