  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp\n\n@mcp.prompt()\ndef customize_prompt() -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    自定义提示\n    \"\"\"\n    return None\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import `mcp` and invoke `mcp.prompt()`.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes that `mcp.prompt()` could enable dynamic code execution if it processes external input, but in this context, it appears to be a decorator that likely modifies or generates prompts.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity observed. The function returns `None`, indicating placeholder or configuration code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import module and define a decorator function.\n- **Analysis:** Function returns `None`, possibly a placeholder. No suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Benign. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—import and define placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; the function is a stub.\n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious signs; function is a placeholder.\n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import `mcp` and decorate a function with `@mcp.prompt()`.\n- **Analysis:** The decorator usage is standard; without internal details of `mcp.prompt()`, it’s difficult to determine if it executes code at import time or modifies behavior. Still, nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is minimal, importing a module and applying a decorator, with a placeholder function returning `None`.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed. The `mcp.prompt()` function could potentially execute code if designed maliciously, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with placeholder or configuration code, no active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
