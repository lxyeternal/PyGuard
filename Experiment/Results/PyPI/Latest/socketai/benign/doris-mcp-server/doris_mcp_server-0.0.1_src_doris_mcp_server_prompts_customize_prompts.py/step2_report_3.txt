  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp\n\n@mcp.prompt()\ndef customize_prompt() -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    自定义提示\n    \"\"\"\n    return None\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import 'mcp' and call 'mcp.prompt()'—possibly for dynamic prompt generation.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes that 'mcp.prompt()' could be used for dynamic code execution but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code calls `mcp.prompt()` as a decorator, which is typical if 'prompt()' returns a decorator function.  \n- The function returns None, indicating a placeholder.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- The risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the potential for dynamic behavior, but the actual code doesn't show malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep the risk score low; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—import and define a placeholder function.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, just a placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, minimal security risk (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is minimal, and the function does nothing.  \n- No malicious activity, data flow, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The risk score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—import 'mcp' and define a placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the function is a placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores are appropriate; no change.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior; the function is a placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores are reasonable; no change.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import 'mcp' and decorate a function with '@mcp.prompt()'.\n- **Analysis:** The decorator could modify or execute code, but there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears standard; no signs of malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Using a decorator from an imported module is common.  \n- The function returns None, indicating a placeholder.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, considering the potential for dynamic behavior, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports are consistent with the code. They all identify that the function is a placeholder, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and placeholder-like.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  All scores seem reasonable given the minimal code and lack of malicious activity. The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential for malicious activity?**  \n  The use of `mcp.prompt()` as a decorator could, in theory, allow dynamic code execution if 'prompt()' is designed maliciously. However, the reports correctly note that there's no evidence of malicious activity here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final System Evaluation:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (low, considering the potential for dynamic behavior, but no actual risk observed)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, functioning as a placeholder for prompt customization, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.  \n- No modifications to scores are necessary.  \n- The overall risk remains very low, with no evidence of malicious activity.",
