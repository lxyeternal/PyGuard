{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'mcp' object from the 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' module, likely to utilize its methods or functionalities related to MCP processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp' which loads external code from a module.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'mcp.prompt()' which executes a method from the imported object.",
  "flows": "Import of 'mcp' → execution of 'mcp.prompt()' within the decorator function.",
  "anomalies": "The decorator '@mcp.prompt()' is applied to a function that returns None. The use of a decorator from an imported module is normal, but without more context about what 'mcp.prompt()' does, it could potentially modify or execute code at import or function definition time.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific object 'mcp' from a module, then defines a function 'customize_prompt' with a decorator '@mcp.prompt()'. The function simply returns None and is likely meant to provide a prompt string. Since 'mcp.prompt()' is used as a decorator, it could potentially modify or wrap the function, or execute code at the time of decoration. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious system calls visible. The usage appears standard for a plugin or extension pattern. Without further context of what 'mcp.prompt()' does internally, the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard use of an imported decorator to modify or augment a function. There are no obvious signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. The use of decorators from external modules is common, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
