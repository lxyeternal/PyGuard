  "purpose": "Importing mcp module from doris_mcp_server.mcp_app, possibly to utilize its functionality in the larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'mcp' from 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app'; invocation of mcp.prompt()",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of mcp.prompt() which could be used to execute dynamic code if 'prompt' involves such behavior",
  "flows": "Import data from external module -> call to mcp.prompt() (possible dynamic code execution or external data handling)",
  "anomalies": "The function 'customize_prompt' returns None, which is unusual if 'prompt()' is expected to generate or process prompts; no evidence of malicious code, but the use of a prompt function suggests potential for dynamic input",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific component 'mcp' from an external module. It defines a decorator 'prompt()' on a function 'customize_prompt' that returns None. The use of 'mcp.prompt()' could imply dynamic prompt generation or processing, which in some contexts might be exploited if external input influences behavior. However, no explicit malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger setup for custom prompts, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, primarily setting up a custom prompt function using a method from an imported module. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flows, or security risks in this fragment. The use of 'prompt' is typical for configuring prompts and does not indicate malicious activity.",
