  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet:\n  ```python\n  from doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp\n\n  @mcp.prompt()\n  def customize_prompt() -> str:\n      \"\"\"\n      自定义提示\n      \"\"\"\n      return None\n  ```\n- The code imports a module 'mcp' and applies its 'prompt()' method as a decorator to a function that returns None.\n- No actual prompt string is provided; the function appears to be a placeholder.\n- The code does not contain any malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The main concern is whether 'mcp.prompt()' could be malicious or allow code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in the code. They correctly note that the function returns None and that the code is minimal and benign.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports mostly treat 'mcp.prompt()' as a decorator that could potentially modify behavior or execute code. While this is a valid concern in general, without knowledge of what 'mcp.prompt()' does internally, the risk cannot be assumed to be high.\n- Some reports suggest that the decorator could execute code at import time, but they do not provide evidence that this is malicious.\n- The assumption that 'prompt()' might be malicious or dangerous is speculative without further context.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's benign appearance, this seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.2), but given the code, a score of 0.1 or 0.2 is reasonable.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.8-1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious activity; the only potential concern is the behavior of 'mcp.prompt()' internally, which is unknown. But without evidence, the risk remains low.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No signs of malware or malicious activity are present.\n- The 'prompt()' method could be a standard decorator that modifies the function or provides some framework hook, not necessarily malicious.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- Some reports assume that 'mcp.prompt()' could execute code or be malicious, but this is speculative without further context.\n- The code itself does not demonstrate any malicious pattern.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all are low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to uncertainty about 'mcp.prompt()' internals, but no evidence of risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports are appropriately cautious but not overly alarmist. The scores reflect the low risk and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed unless more context about 'mcp.prompt()' reveals malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores; no escalation is justified.",
