  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet and considering the implications.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom doris_mcp_server.mcp_app import mcp\n\n@mcp.prompt()\ndef customize_prompt() -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    自定义提示\n    \"\"\"\n    return None\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Importing `mcp` and calling `mcp.prompt()`.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes that `mcp.prompt()` could facilitate dynamic prompts or code execution, but the function `customize_prompt()` returns `None`. No malicious activity or data flow is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, likely part of a larger system setup.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to potential for dynamic prompts but no evidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Placeholder function with no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, minimal security concern.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Function is a placeholder, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar import and placeholder function.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; function returns `None`.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Importing `mcp` and using `@mcp.prompt()` as a decorator.\n- **Analysis:** The decorator pattern suggests that `mcp.prompt()` might modify or wrap the function. While the code itself is benign, the use of decorators from external modules can sometimes imply dynamic behavior or code modification at decoration time.\n- **Potential concern:** Without knowing what `mcp.prompt()` does internally, there’s a slight risk it could execute code or alter behavior dynamically, especially if it involves user input or external data.\n- **Conclusion:** No explicit malicious activity, but the pattern warrants cautious scoring.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)\n- Risk: 0.1 or 0.2? Since the only concern is the decorator's internal behavior, which isn't visible, a conservative score of **0.2** seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal and primarily involves importing and defining placeholder functions.\n- The main point of concern is the use of `mcp.prompt()` as a decorator, which could, in theory, execute code or modify behavior at decoration time. However, in the absence of evidence, this remains speculative.\n- None of the reports indicate signs of malware, obfuscation, or active malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — due to the decorator pattern and potential for dynamic behavior, but no concrete evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The current scores in all reports are reasonable.\n- The only slight adjustment I would suggest is for Report 5, increasing the risk score from 0.1 to **0.2** to reflect the potential for dynamic code execution via the decorator, pending further internal knowledge of `mcp.prompt()`.\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign with minimal security risks.**",
