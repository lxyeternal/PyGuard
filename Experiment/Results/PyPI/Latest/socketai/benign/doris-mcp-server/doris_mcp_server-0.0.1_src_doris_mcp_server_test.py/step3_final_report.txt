  "purpose": "A Python client utility for interacting with an MCP server to list resources, tools, prompts, and invoke tools with default parameters for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading server responses via asynchronous API calls, command-line arguments for server path and test selection.",
  "sinks": "Printing server responses and invoking session methods; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> server process invocation -> server responses -> processing and printing; no untrusted data flows leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous client that connects to an MCP server via subprocess, lists resources, tools, prompts, and invokes tools with default arguments based on schemas. It performs no data injection, code execution beyond API calls, or malicious network activity. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The server process invocation is standard for testing utilities, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The responses are printed to stdout, with no data leaks or suspicious handling. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with benign testing utility patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured MCP client testing utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. It interacts with the server via standard API calls, constructs default arguments safely, and outputs responses without suspicious processing.",
