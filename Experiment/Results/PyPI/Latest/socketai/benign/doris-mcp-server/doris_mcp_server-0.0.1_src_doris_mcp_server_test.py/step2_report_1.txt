  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a benign, straightforward client utility for interacting with an MCP server.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code's purpose is to list resources, tools, prompts, and invoke tools/prompts with default parameters.\n- The data flows involve server communication and console output, with no evident malicious activity.\n- The confidence level across reports is high (0.9), and malware scores are consistently 0.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of the Code\n- The code matches the described purpose: an MCP client testing utility.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- The code does not handle untrusted user input beyond command-line args, and the data from server responses is only printed or used in API calls.\n- The default argument generation for tools is benign and schema-based.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code's structure is straightforward and standard for an async client.\n- No indication of mishandling data or insecure practices.\n\n### Score Justification\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), consistent with benign interaction patterns.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations\n- No adjustments needed; scores are reasonable.\n- The only point is that the code does perform network interactions, but these are standard API calls, not suspicious.\n\n### Final Assessment\nBased on all reports and analysis:\n- The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk score should stay low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the detailed reasoning above.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
