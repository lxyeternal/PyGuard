{
  "purpose": "The script functions as a testing utility to connect to an MCP server, list resources, tools, and prompts, and invoke certain actions for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "User-supplied command-line argument '--server' (script path), potentially external server responses, and predefined tool schemas",
  "sinks": "Console output (print statements), network communication via stdio streams, session method calls, and potentially untrusted data from server responses",
  "flows": "User input '--server' → server command execution → session initialization → listing resources/tools/prompts → optional tool invocation and prompt retrieval",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all data appears to be dynamically handled. Use of 'python' command to run a server process is standard. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous client session with an MCP server specified by a command-line argument. It performs standard operations such as listing resources, tools, prompts, and invoking a tool with generic arguments. All data handling appears to be within expected boundaries, with no evident malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. The code relies on external server responses, but these are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious data leaks, or potentially harmful behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate testing utility that interacts with an MCP server for listing and calling resources, tools, and prompts. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware within this code fragment.",
