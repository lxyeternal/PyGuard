{
  "purpose": "This script acts as a testing utility for interacting with an MCP server, listing resources, tools, prompts, and calling specific tools or prompts based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments for server path and test type, as well as data streams from the stdio client connection to the MCP server.",
  "sinks": "Data sent to the MCP server through session methods such as list_resources(), list_tools(), list_prompts(), get_prompt(), and call_tool() functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments determine server connection; user-selected test flows invoke session methods that send data to the server; responses are printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code mainly orchestrates interaction with a server; no data exfiltration or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous client connection to an MCP server using parameters provided via command-line arguments. It performs standard listing and calling operations—listing resources, tools, prompts, retrieving prompt content, and calling tools with default arguments. All actions involve straightforward API calls without any suspicious data handling, encoding, or injection. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are observed. The code relies on external libraries for MCP interaction and uses standard asyncio patterns. Overall, the code functions as a benign testing utility without malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard client tool for interacting with an MCP server, performing listing and calling operations without any malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious data flows. It appears safe and benign.",
