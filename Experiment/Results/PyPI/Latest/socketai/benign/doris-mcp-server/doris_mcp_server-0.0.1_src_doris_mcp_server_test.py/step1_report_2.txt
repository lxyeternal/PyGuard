{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to connect to an MCP server and perform tests on resources, tools, and prompts, including listing and retrieving data.",
  "sources": "Reads server command-line arguments, loads server script path, and communicates over streams with the server using the stdio client.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes command parameters and receives data streams; prints outputs directly to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger server connection; session initialization; data retrieval from server resources, tools, and prompts; outputs are printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no use of insecure functions or unsafe SQL; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code connects to a server process via subprocess streams, performs list and get operations on resources, tools, and prompts. It constructs default arguments for tool invocation. No untrusted data inputs from external sources are processed beyond command-line arguments, and all data flow is contained within the standard operation of listing and retrieving data from the server. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are evident. It functions as a test harness for server interactions, with clear, intended operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate client script for testing an MCP server, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It solely performs data listing and retrieval operations, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
