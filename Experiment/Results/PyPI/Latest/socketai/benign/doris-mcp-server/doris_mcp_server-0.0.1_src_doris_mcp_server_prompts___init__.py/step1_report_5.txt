  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines the __all__ attribute for exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.general_prompts'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions to the module's exported interface (__all__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a relative module, likely part of a package, and sets __all__ for exports. No external data input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for module imports and exports. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
