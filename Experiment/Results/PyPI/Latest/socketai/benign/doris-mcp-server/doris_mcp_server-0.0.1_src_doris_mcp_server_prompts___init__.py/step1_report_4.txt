  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from a local module and exposes them for external use via __all__.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions to the exported list (__all__), but no runtime data flow or execution occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module and defines the __all__ list to control what is exported. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and syntax are standard for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple import/export setup for module functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
