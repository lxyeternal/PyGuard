{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a Python module by importing specific functions from a local module and setting the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.general_prompts'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports functions and exposes them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a relative module and explicitly declares these functions as part of the module's public API via __all__. There are no signs of data manipulation, user input handling, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard for Python module definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module import and export setup with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It performs a standard function of exposing specific functions for external use.",
