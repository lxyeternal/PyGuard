  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export setup, importing functions from a local module and setting `__all__`.\n   - The original code matches this description exactly.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all correctly identify the code as standard module setup.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The analysis correctly notes the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1.0, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The scores are all zero for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n   - No signs of malicious intent are present.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard Python module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Given the reports' correctness, I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- No further action required.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the benign nature of the code snippet.",
