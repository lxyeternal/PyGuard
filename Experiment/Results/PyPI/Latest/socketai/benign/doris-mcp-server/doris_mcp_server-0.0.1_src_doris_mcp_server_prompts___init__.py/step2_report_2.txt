  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- All reports describe a simple Python module that imports specific functions from a local module `general_prompts` (sometimes noted as `.general_prompts` or `./general_prompts`) and then sets the `__all__` variable to expose these functions as part of the module's public API.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n- The original code is straightforward: import statements and setting `__all__`.\n- No signs of data manipulation, user input, network activity, or other suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are evident in this code snippet.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n- The reports are consistent in their analysis, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n- **Note:** The reports correctly do not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what is present.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1.0 or 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n- Since the code is purely import/export with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score above 0.0 is unwarranted.\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Address malware scores**\n- All reports assign malware score as 0.\n- Correct, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, harmless Python module that imports functions and declares them as part of its public API.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and thorough.**",
