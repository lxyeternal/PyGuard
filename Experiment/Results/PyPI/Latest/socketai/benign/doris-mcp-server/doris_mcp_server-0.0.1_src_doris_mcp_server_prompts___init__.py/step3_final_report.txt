{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__ for public API purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.general_prompts'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup that imports functions and defines __all__ to specify the public API. It does not handle data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assigned scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
