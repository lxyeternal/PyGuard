  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code simply imports a set of functions from a local module (`.general_prompts`) and assigns them to `__all__` to specify the public API of the module. There are no data flows, no user input handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious elements. They correctly identify that the code is a standard module setup.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They do not overlook any potential issues, and their reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity, there is no indication of malicious intent. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present. The score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is purely for importing functions and exposing them, with no data manipulation or external interactions, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  Some reports mention \"no suspicious patterns,\" which is accurate. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary here, as the code is standard.\n\n- **Could there be hidden risks?**  \n  Given only this snippet, no. However, if the imported module (`.general_prompts`) contains malicious code, that could change the overall security posture. But based solely on this code, no.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Risk: **0**\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain component appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided snippet. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf future analysis includes the contents of `general_prompts`, a review of that module would be necessary to confirm the overall security posture.",
