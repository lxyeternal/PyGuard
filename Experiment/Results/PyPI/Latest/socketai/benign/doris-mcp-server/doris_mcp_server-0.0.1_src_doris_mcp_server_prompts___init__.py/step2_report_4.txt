  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code in question is a simple Python module that imports functions from a local module (`.general_prompts`) and assigns them to `__all__` to define the public API.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, user input handling, network communication, dynamic code execution, or other behaviors that could introduce security concerns.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - No logical errors or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly notes the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1.0 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0.0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Malware and Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely import/export setup with no malicious activity, malware score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - The risk score of 0.0 is justified because there's no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is benign; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without basis.\n   - The assessments are consistent and well-justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores align with the code's nature: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the provided scores.\n- I would maintain the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.0.\n- The confidence level remains at 1.0, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Overall**:\n- The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no security concerns.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\nThis is a benign, well-understood pattern with no security issues.",
