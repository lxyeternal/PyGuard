  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a local module, which is a common practice for code organization. It then declares these functions in __all__ to specify public API. There are no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution aspects present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to typical Python conventions without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import and export of functions from a local module without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
