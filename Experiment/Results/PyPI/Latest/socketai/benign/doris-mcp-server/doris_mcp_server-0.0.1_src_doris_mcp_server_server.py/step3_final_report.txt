{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a server and performs a database connectivity check before starting the server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the DorisConnector class during the database connection test.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The source (database connection attempt) flows into the success or failure handling, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server startup script that tests database connectivity with a benign query ('SELECT 1') and then runs the server. It relies on external modules whose internal implementations are unknown but are used in a standard manner. No malicious commands, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not handle user input, secrets, or perform risky operations. The external module DorisConnector's trustworthiness is assumed but outside the scope of this snippet. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign server startup routine with a simple database check. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
