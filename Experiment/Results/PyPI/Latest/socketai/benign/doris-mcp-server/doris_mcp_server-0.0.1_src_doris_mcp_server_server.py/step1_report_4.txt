  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a Doris MCP server, including testing the database connection.",
  "sources": "DorisConnector().execute_query('SELECT 1') - reading from the database; import statements - importing modules.",
  "sinks": "execute_query method potentially executing SQL queries; print statements for logging.",
  "flows": "Initialization of DorisConnector, execution of a test SQL query, then proceeding to run the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of eval or exec, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for server and database interactions, performs a database connection test by executing a simple SQL command ('SELECT 1'), and then runs the server if successful. No untrusted input sources, no data leaks, or suspicious code paths are evident. The database connection uses an object (DorisConnector) whose implementation is not provided; if it contains malicious code, it is outside this snippet's scope. The print statements are for status updates. No hardcoded secrets are visible. The overall flow is straightforward: initialize, test DB, run server.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard server startup routine with a database connection check. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no malicious code or supply chain attacks detected within this code snippet.",
