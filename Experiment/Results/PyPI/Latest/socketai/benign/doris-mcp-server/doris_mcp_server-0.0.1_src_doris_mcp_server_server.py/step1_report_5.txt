{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a Doris MCP server, including testing database connectivity.",
  "sources": "Reading environment configurations through DorisConnector, and potentially external modules like doris_mcp_server.mcp_app and doris_mcp_server.db",
  "sinks": "Executing database queries via DorisConnector.execute_query",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., connection parameters) flows into DorisConnector, which executes queries, but the code does not handle untrusted user input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of try-except for error handling is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a server class, tests database connectivity, and runs the server. It relies on external modules for database connection and server functionality. The database test executes a simple 'SELECT 1' query, which is standard for connectivity testing. No input validation, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. No code injections, environment variable mishandling, or external network connections are visible within this code segment. External modules are assumed to be standard or trusted based on their naming.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs server initialization and database connectivity testing with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for starting a server with database checks.",
