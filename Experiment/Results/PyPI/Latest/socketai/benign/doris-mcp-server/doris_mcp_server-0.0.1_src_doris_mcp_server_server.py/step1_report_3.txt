{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs a Doris MCP server, including testing the database connection.",
  "sources": "Imports from doris_mcp_server modules, especially DorisConnector for database access.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL queries through DorisConnector's execute_query method, user-facing print statements.",
  "flows": "The code creates a DorisConnector instance, runs a SQL query, and outputs success or failure messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The SQL query is a simple test, and there are no suspicious external connections or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class that tests the database connection and then runs the server. The database connection test uses a simple 'SELECT 1' query with no user input involved. No user input is processed or passed to SQL queries, reducing risk of injection. The imports are from the project's own modules, and there are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The print statements are for status reporting and do not suggest malicious intent. No code appears obfuscated, and there are no signs of malware or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward server initialization script with a basic database connectivity check. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this module. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation.",
