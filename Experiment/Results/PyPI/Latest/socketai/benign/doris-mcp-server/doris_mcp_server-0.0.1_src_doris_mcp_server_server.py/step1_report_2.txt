{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a Doris MCP server, including testing database connectivity.",
  "sources": "DorisConnector() instantiation, execute_query method, and environment/config files (implied).",
  "sinks": "Database query execution, print statements, exception handling, and server run method.",
  "flows": "Initialization of MCPDorisServer -> _test_db_connection (executes SQL) -> run server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network connections, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code, and no suspicious input/output handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a server and tests a database connection using the DorisConnector class. It performs a simple 'SELECT 1' query to verify connectivity, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. No usage of environment variables or inputs that could be exploited. Exception handling is straightforward. The code depends on external modules for core functionality but does not itself perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server startup script with database connectivity testing, containing no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe and standard in design.",
