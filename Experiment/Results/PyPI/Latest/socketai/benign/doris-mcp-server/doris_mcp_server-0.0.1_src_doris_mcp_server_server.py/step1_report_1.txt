{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a Doris MCP server, testing database connectivity before starting the server.",
  "sources": "Database query execution via DorisConnector.execute_query; import statements loading modules and resources.",
  "sinks": "Executing SQL query in '_test_db_connection' method.",
  "flows": "Input data (SQL query) flows from '_test_db_connection' to the database connection and executes the query.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code; straightforward structure; no external input handling other than the database query.",
  "analysis": "The code imports server, database, resources, and prompts modules. It defines a class to manage server startup, including a database connectivity test using a simple 'SELECT 1' query. The database connection is created via DorisConnector and closed after the test. The server startup process includes error handling with traceback printing. No user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources are processed directly. The database query appears standard, with no signs of injection or malicious commands. The overall flow is typical for a server startup script, with no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server startup script that tests database connectivity before launching. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
