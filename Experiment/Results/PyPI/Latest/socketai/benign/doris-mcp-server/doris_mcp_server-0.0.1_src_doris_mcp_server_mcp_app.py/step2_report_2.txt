  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing modules and instantiating a server object with a configuration value.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- The primary concern raised is the trustworthiness of `MCP_SERVER_NAME`, which is a configuration value, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk unless the configuration value is malicious or untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or code injection.\n- The only potential security concern is the use of an external configuration value (`MCP_SERVER_NAME`) which could be untrusted, but this is a common practice and not necessarily a vulnerability.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and secure, assuming the configuration source is trusted.\n- No discrepancies or false positives are present.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2). Given the code's simplicity and the reliance on external configuration, these seem reasonable. However, if the configuration source is untrusted, the risk could be higher, but the code itself does not manipulate or leak data.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The scores are low because the code is minimal, with no suspicious behavior.\n- The only concern is trust in the configuration value, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- Emphasize that ensuring the integrity and validation of `MCP_SERVER_NAME` in the broader system is crucial, but this is beyond the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, assuming configuration is secure)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard server instantiation pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities within this snippet. The primary security consideration relates to the trustworthiness of the configuration source, which should be validated elsewhere in the system.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report is accurate; the code is safe and straightforward. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
