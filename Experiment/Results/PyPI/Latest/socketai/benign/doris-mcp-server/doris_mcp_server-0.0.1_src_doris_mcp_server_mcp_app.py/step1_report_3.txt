{
  "purpose": "Initialize and instantiate a FastMCP server object with a configuration name.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and 'doris_mcp_server.config', usage of 'MCP_SERVER_NAME'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of 'FastMCP' with 'MCP_SERVER_NAME', which could potentially use untrusted configuration data if 'MCP_SERVER_NAME' is compromised.",
  "flows": "Importing 'MCP_SERVER_NAME' from configuration, then passing it to 'FastMCP' constructor, which may involve network or system initialization depending on 'FastMCP' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; straightforward instantiation. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then creates a single instance of 'FastMCP' using a configuration variable. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or code injection. The usage appears standard for a service setup. However, the security of 'MCP_SERVER_NAME' depends on its source and trustworthiness, but the code itself does not manipulate or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup script that initializes a server object with a configuration name. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment. Its security posture depends on the source and integrity of imported modules and configuration.",
