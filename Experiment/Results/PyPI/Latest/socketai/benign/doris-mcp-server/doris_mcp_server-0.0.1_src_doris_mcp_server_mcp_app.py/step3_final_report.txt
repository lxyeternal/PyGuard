  "purpose": "Instantiate a singleton MCP server using configuration data.",
  "sources": "Import of MCP_SERVER_NAME from external configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Import MCP_SERVER_NAME -> instantiate FastMCP with MCP_SERVER_NAME.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import and instantiation of a server object with a configuration value. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The only potential security concern is reliance on external configuration, which could be untrusted, but the code itself does not manipulate or leak data. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and the standard pattern of configuration-based instantiation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for creating a server object with configuration data. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary security consideration is ensuring the trustworthiness of the external configuration source, but this is outside the scope of the code snippet. Overall, the code is safe and does not warrant a higher malware or obfuscation score.",
