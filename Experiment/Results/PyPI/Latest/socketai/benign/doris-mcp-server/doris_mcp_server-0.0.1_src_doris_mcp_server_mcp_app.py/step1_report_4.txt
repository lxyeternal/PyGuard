  "purpose": "Instantiate a FastMCP server with a server name from configuration",
  "sources": "Import statements for FastMCP class and MCP_SERVER_NAME from configuration",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of FastMCP with MCP_SERVER_NAME, potential use of untrusted or external configuration value",
  "flows": "Importing configuration -> Creating FastMCP instance with MCP_SERVER_NAME",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code observed. Usage of external configuration is standard, but dependency on external configuration value warrants caution if not validated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class and a configuration parameter, then creates an instance of the server class using a configuration value. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. The only concern is reliance on external configuration MCP_SERVER_NAME, which should be validated and secured to prevent misconfiguration. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no obvious security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard instantiation of a server object using configuration data. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. Care should be taken to ensure that MCP_SERVER_NAME is properly validated and secured in the broader context.",
