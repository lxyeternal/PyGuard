  "flows": "Reading MCP_SERVER_NAME -> Passing MCP_SERVER_NAME to FastMCP constructor",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious library usage",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class FastMCP and a configuration value MCP_SERVER_NAME, then creates an instance of FastMCP with that name. No user input, untrusted data, or sensitive information appears to be handled insecurely. The imported modules seem to be standard or project-specific modules; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no complex logic, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple instantiation of a server object using a configuration parameter. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
