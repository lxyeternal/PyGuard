  "purpose": "Instantiate a FastMCP server object with a server name from the configuration.",
  "sources": "Import from mcp.server.fastmcp and doris_mcp_server.config; reading MCP_SERVER_NAME from config.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of FastMCP with MCP_SERVER_NAME could be a sink if the name is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Importing MCP_SERVER_NAME from config -> passing MCP_SERVER_NAME to FastMCP constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and a configuration variable, then creates an instance of FastMCP with the server name. The source is the imported config value, and the sink is the instantiation of FastMCP. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code manipulation. The code appears straightforward and intended for configuration-based server setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script that instantiates a server object with a name from configuration. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
