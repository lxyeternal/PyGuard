  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code and assessing the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\n# mcp_app.py\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\nfrom doris_mcp_server.config import MCP_SERVER_NAME\n\n# Instantiate a singleton MCP server\nmcp = FastMCP(MCP_SERVER_NAME)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Instantiate FastMCP with server name from config.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that this is straightforward instantiation. Since `MCP_SERVER_NAME` is imported from a config, and there's no evidence of malicious code, the low risk and malware scores are justified.  \n**Verdict:** Valid, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize server with configuration data.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, straightforward code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious activity detected.  \n**Verdict:** Valid, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Instantiate with configuration name.\n- **Findings:** Potential concern if `MCP_SERVER_NAME` is untrusted, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report notes that reliance on external configuration could be a security concern, but the code itself doesn't manipulate or leak data. The risk score is slightly higher (0.2) to reflect that misconfiguration or untrusted input could pose issues, but no evidence of malicious intent.  \n**Verdict:** The risk score is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Instantiate server with config value.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, but reliance on external config.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The potential risk from untrusted configuration is acknowledged, but the code itself is benign.  \n**Verdict:** Valid, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Instantiate server with config value.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code. The low risk score reflects minimal concern.  \n**Verdict:** Valid, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code is very simple: importing a class and a config variable, then instantiating an object. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports agree on zero malware risk, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The risk scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, primarily around the trustworthiness of `MCP_SERVER_NAME`. Given the code's simplicity, these are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:**  \n  High confidence (0.8 to 1) is justified; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, assuming proper validation of configuration.\n\n**Note:** The security posture depends on how `MCP_SERVER_NAME` is managed outside this code. If it is untrusted or can be manipulated by an attacker, the risk could be higher, but the code itself remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications to scores or reasoning are necessary. The code is a standard configuration-based instantiation with no evident security issues.",
