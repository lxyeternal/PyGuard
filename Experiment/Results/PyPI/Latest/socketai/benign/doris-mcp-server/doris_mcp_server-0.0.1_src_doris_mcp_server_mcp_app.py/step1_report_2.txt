  "purpose": "Initialize and instantiate a FastMCP server instance using configuration data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules: 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and 'doris_mcp_server.config'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the 'FastMCP' class with 'MCP_SERVER_NAME' which may come from an external configuration.",
  "flows": "Importing configuration from 'doris_mcp_server.config' into the 'FastMCP' constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and a configuration value, then creates an instance of 'FastMCP' using the configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a server initialization process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and seems to serve a standard purpose of setting up a server instance with configuration data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
