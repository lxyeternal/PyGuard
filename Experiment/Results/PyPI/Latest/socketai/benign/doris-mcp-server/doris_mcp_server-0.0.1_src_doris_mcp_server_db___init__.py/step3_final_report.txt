  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing specific classes and functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.db' and '.tools'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import statements and symbol exports; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code is transparent, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious module interface with no security risks or obfuscation. All assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
