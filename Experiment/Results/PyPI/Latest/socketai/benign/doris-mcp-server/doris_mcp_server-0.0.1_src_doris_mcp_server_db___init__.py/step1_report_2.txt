{
  "purpose": "This code is used for module exports, exposing certain classes and functions related to database operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.db and .tools) that likely provide database connection and query functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code exports imported functions and classes, but no untrusted data handling or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this snippet alone, as it only involves import and export statements without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are evident in this straightforward module export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__, facilitating controlled module API exposure. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for Python modules that organize exports explicitly. No input sources or data sinks are involved in this fragment, and there are no apparent flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition file with no malicious behavior detected. It simply re-exports functions and classes for use elsewhere, with no security risks apparent in this snippet.",
