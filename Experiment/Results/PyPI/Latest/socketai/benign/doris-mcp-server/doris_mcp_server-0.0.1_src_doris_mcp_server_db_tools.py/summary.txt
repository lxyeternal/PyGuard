  "conclusion": "The code is safe for read-only queries with effective command restrictions. The primary security concern is the lack of sanitization for table_name parameters in preview_table and describe_table, which could be exploited for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. To enhance security, implement validation or sanitization of table_name inputs. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.3 due to potential injection risk."
