  "purpose": "Provides tools for executing safe SELECT queries, previewing tables, describing table schemas, and listing tables in a Doris database.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: sql (for run_select_query), table_name (for preview_table, describe_table), db_name (for list_all_tables). Data retrieval via DorisConnector methods.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL queries via DorisConnector.execute_query() and get_table_schema(), data returned as formatted strings. No data is written or sent over network outside return statements.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> run_select_query/preview_table/describe_table/list_all_tables -> DorisConnector methods -> formatted string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Use of regex to restrict SQL commands is appropriate. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for safe read-only database operations. The function _is_safe_select() restricts SQL to SELECT statements only, preventing modification commands. The SQL execution is contained within try-except blocks, and results are formatted for display. The functions for table preview, description, and listing leverage DorisConnector, which is presumed to handle database interactions securely. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or sabotage code. The code adheres to standard practices for database read operations without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe, read-only database queries with appropriate input validation and exception handling. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation for database inspection.",
