  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily for read-only database operations with safety checks.\n- The only potential issue is that 'preview_table' and 'describe_table' directly interpolate user input into SQL statements without sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection if 'table_name' is maliciously crafted.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- The reports generally agree on the core logic.\n- Some reports emphasize the potential for SQL injection in 'preview_table' and 'describe_table' due to string interpolation, which is valid.\n- They correctly note that 'run_select_query' has a safety check to restrict queries to SELECT, reducing risk.\n- No significant logical errors are identified.\n\n**3. Score evaluations:**\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores range from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting minor concerns about SQL injection potential.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5; they remain at 0.2–0.4.\n- This is appropriate since the main concern is potential SQL injection via 'table_name', which, while noteworthy, does not currently demonstrate active malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious network activity.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that DorisConnector handles sanitization internally; this is reasonable but should be verified.\n- The potential for SQL injection in 'preview_table' and 'describe_table' depends on whether 'table_name' is sanitized elsewhere or by DorisConnector.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.3 (average of the reports' scores, reflecting low but notable risk due to potential SQL injection vector)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is largely safe for read-only operations, with a minor concern about SQL injection in functions that interpolate user input directly into SQL statements. No malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate, but I would slightly increase the overall risk score to 0.3 to reflect the potential injection vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** To mitigate this, sanitizing 'table_name' or using parameterized queries within DorisConnector (if supported) would be advisable.",
