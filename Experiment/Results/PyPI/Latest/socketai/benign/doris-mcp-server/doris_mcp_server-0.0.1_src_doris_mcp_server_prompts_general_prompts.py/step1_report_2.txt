{
  "purpose": "Define prompt templates for querying and analyzing database tables within a system, likely for data analysis or management.",
  "sources": "Prompt functions that generate instructions based on input parameters; no external data sources or input reading mechanisms evident.",
  "sinks": "Generated strings that are returned as prompts; no direct injection or untrusted data handling present. No data leaks or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (table_name, column, etc.) flow into formatted prompt strings returned by functions; no further processing or data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code mainly defines prompt templates with standard string formatting, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of function decorators and prompt-generating functions for data analysis tasks. It uses standard Python syntax, with no external data fetching, no code execution, no use of untrusted inputs beyond parameter formatting, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The presence of multi-turn dialog templates is consistent with prompt design for user interaction, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of prompt template definitions intended for data analysis workflows. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in the provided code.",
