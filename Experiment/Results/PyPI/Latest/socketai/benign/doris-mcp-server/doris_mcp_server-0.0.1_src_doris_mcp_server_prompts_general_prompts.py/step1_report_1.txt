{
  "purpose": "Define multiple prompt templates for data analysis and query generation in a server-side application.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from external modules 'doris_mcp_server.mcp_app' and 'mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts', and defines several functions that generate formatted strings for prompts.",
  "sinks": "The functions return formatted prompt strings that could potentially include user input (e.g., table names, column names). These are not direct data sinks but could be exploited if user input is maliciously crafted to inject code or misleading prompts.",
  "flows": "User provides inputs such as table names and column names; these inputs are embedded into prompt strings returned by functions. These prompts are then likely sent to an LLM or prompt-based system for execution or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are detected. The code solely defines prompt templates. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of decorated functions that generate prompt strings based on input parameters. It imports external modules for messaging classes and decorators but does not execute any dangerous operations. All functions are safe string formatting for prompt templates. There are no direct data leaks, network communications, or system modifications. The structure is straightforward, serving as a prompt generation module without hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard template definition for prompts related to database analysis tasks. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It relies on external modules for messaging and prompt management, which are assumed to be safe. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate data analysis prompts.",
