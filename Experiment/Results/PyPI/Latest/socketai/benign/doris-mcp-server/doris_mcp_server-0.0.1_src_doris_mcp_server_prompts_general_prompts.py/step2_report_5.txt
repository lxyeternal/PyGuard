  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is primarily defining prompt templates, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes the safe use of external modules and straightforward string formatting.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the benign nature, no external data fetching, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 seems slightly high but still acceptable as a conservative estimate, given the lack of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, confirms the code's benign purpose, with no signs of malicious activity. Notes the potential for prompt misuse but nothing malicious in the code itself.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The security risk score is 0.1, which aligns with the minimal potential for prompt misuse.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is straightforward prompt generation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1 would be appropriate; 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—prompt templates for database analysis—there's minimal security risk. The slight variations in the reports' risk scores (0.0 to 0.1 or 0.9) are acceptable. I would set the overall risk score to **0.0 or 0.1** to reflect the benign nature, unless there's concern about prompt misuse.\n\n### **Final Judgment:**\n\n- The code is a benign prompt template module.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with a slight conservative margin in some cases.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or at most 0.1 for conservative safety)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reported assessments are accurate. No further action needed.",
