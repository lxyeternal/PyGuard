  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the accuracy of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of prompt template functions decorated with `@mcp.prompt()`, returning formatted strings based on input parameters.\n- No actual data processing, data transmission, code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The functions do not handle sensitive data directly, nor do they include any hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- External modules (`doris_mcp_server.mcp_app`, `mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts`) are used for messaging and prompt management, which are assumed to be safe.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines prompt templates for data analysis, importing external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates prompt strings with user inputs embedded.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; purely template functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n- Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with a focus on database querying prompts.\n- No suspicious behaviors or anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.9 (possibly slightly high but acceptable given the benign nature), Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity. The high security risk score could be slightly conservative but acceptable, considering the prompt generation nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Focused on data analysis prompts, including trend analysis and outlier detection.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0.1 (very low), Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous, with prompt templates for database queries.\n- No anomalies or malicious signs.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Defines prompt templates for data analysis, no malicious behaviors.\n- No anomalies.\n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting that the code could be misused if prompts are exploited, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- The **security risk scores** could be uniformly set to 0, given the benign nature of the code. The few reports that assign 0.1 or 0.9 might overstate the risk, as prompt generation functions do not inherently pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no actual security vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Confidence:** Should be 1, reflecting certainty in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign prompt template functions, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk. The current scores are generally accurate but could be standardized to reflect zero risk across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that prompt templates, in isolation, are unlikely to pose security threats unless combined with other malicious code or external vulnerabilities.",
