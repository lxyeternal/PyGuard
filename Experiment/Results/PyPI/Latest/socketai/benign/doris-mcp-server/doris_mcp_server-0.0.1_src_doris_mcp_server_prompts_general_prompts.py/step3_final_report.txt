{
  "purpose": "Define prompt templates for database and data analysis tasks, generating formatted strings based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as table_name, column, table, date_col, metric_col, days, group_col, target_col, which are embedded into prompt strings.",
  "sinks": "Generated prompt strings that incorporate user inputs; no external data handling or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into formatted prompt strings returned by each function.",
  "anomalies": "None; functions are straightforward, returning formatted strings without side effects or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of decorated functions that generate prompts based on parameters. No data leaks, external system calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and readable, relying on external modules assumed to be safe. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The functions serve as templates for user prompts, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining prompt templates for data analysis and database queries. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential prompt injection downstream, but the code itself is safe.",
