{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of prompt templates for a chatbot or AI assistant to perform database-related queries and analyses, including table overview, comment retrieval, summarization, grouping, trend analysis, and outlier detection.",
  "sources": "Code reads input parameters such as table names, column names, date columns, and metric columns. It also constructs prompt strings based on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings that will be used as prompts for further processing or user display. No direct untrusted data handling or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into prompt string construction, which then provides instructions for database querying or analysis. No untrusted data is directly executed or used as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code primarily creates natural language prompts based on user input. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs decorators and functions to generate prompts for database analysis tasks, using user-supplied parameters to create instructions. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden network activity. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an AI-assisted database querying tool. Usage of third-party modules (doris_mcp_server.mcp_app and mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts) is typical for such frameworks and does not indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, unusual behaviors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a prompt generator for database analysis, with no indication of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured for its intended purpose without any suspicious elements.",
