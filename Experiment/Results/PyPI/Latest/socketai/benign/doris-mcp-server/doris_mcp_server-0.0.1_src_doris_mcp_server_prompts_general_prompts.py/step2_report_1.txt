  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is purely defining prompt templates with no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no code injection risks.\n- **Code confirmation:** The code consists of decorated functions returning formatted strings, no data leaks, no external system calls, and no malicious code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None detected. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The scores are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, purely template generation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature, no external data handling, and straightforward string formatting.\n- **Code confirmation:** Same as above, functions generate prompts based on input parameters.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.9 (reported as 0.9). Given the benign nature, a high security risk score seems unwarranted.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no external system calls, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n\n**Suggestion:** The security risk score should be **0** rather than 0.9. The high score appears unreasonable given the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is just prompt templates, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Code confirmation:** Functions generate prompts; no data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. The small non-zero score might reflect minimal concern but is not justified by the code.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, benign, and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Suggestion:** The security risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign prompt generation code, no malicious activity.\n- **Code confirmation:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments; benign prompt templates.\n- **Code confirmation:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk/security score:** Most reports suggest a very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code content.\n\n**However, the second report's security risk score of 0.9 is inconsistent with the benign nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code).\n- **Risk/security score:** **0** (no security risk present).\n\n**Justification:** The code is straightforward, purely defining prompt templates with no external system interaction, no data leaks, no code injection, and no obfuscation. It relies on external modules assumed to be safe. The high security risk score in report 2 is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious behavior or code present.                           |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious activities.       |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are generally accurate, but the security risk score in report 2 should be lowered to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
