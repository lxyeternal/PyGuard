{
  "purpose": "The code defines various prompt templates for data analysis tasks within a larger system, enabling structured user interactions for querying database structures, summaries, group analysis, trend analysis, and outlier detection.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input (e.g., table names, column names, days, and analysis requests) through function parameters and inline string literals. It does not process external untrusted data directly from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if prompts are used improperly with sensitive data, but there are no direct sinks such as network transmissions or file writes shown in this code. The functions generate descriptive prompt strings for further processing.",
  "flows": "User inputs (table names, columns, days, analysis requests) flow into prompt-generation functions which produce descriptive query instructions. These instructions are then used downstream, likely in a database or data visualization context, but no actual data processing or external communication occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code consists of straightforward function definitions with string formatting. No external or hidden malicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to generate prompts for data analysis tasks. It relies on decorators from a library (mcp.prompt) to define prompts and uses string formatting to create instructions for database querying and analysis. The functions are simple and focus on user interaction, with no direct data access or network operations. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, secret handling, or obfuscated logic, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of prompt templates for a data analysis assistant. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The functions are well-structured for their purpose, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
