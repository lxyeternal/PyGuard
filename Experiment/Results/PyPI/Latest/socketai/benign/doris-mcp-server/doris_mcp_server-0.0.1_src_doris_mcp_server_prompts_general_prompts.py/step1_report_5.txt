{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of prompt templates for data analysis and querying, used within a larger application likely related to database querying and analysis via the mcp framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads static input parameters such as table names, column names, date ranges, and user messages.",
  "sinks": "Generated prompt strings that are returned and potentially displayed or executed in the context of a database or analysis tool.",
  "flows": "User inputs (e.g., table names, column names, analysis commands) flow into prompt functions, which generate descriptive query prompts for database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code is mainly straightforward function definitions with string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple prompt-generating functions decorated with mcp.prompt(), each returning formatted strings based on input parameters. These prompts are designed for querying databases or performing data analysis tasks such as table structure inquiry, summarization, grouping, trend analysis, and outlier detection. The functions handle user inputs like table and column names, days for trend analysis, etc., and produce human-readable instructions. There is no code that executes system commands, handles sensitive data, or communicates over networks. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. The code appears to be purely for generating prompts for an analysis framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of prompt template definitions for a data analysis system. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured and intended for legitimate purposes within a data querying and analysis context.",
