  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report correctly states that the code only defines prompt templates, with no malicious behavior or code execution.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The scores seem appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is benign, purely defining prompt strings with no malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report confirms the code is straightforward prompt template definitions.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.9 is perhaps slightly high but justified if considering potential misuse of prompts; however, since no actual malicious activity is detected, perhaps a lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The code itself is safe, but in deployment, prompt injection or misuse could pose a risk, but that is speculative.\n- **Overall:** Slightly overestimating risk; recommend lowering to 0.1 unless there's a known vulnerability.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Again, perhaps slightly high but acceptable given the potential for prompt misuse.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, just prompt templates; the risk is minimal.\n- **Overall:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Same as above, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Overall:** Slightly overestimated risk score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 or 0.1 would be more fitting.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign prompt template definitions.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is accurate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The risk scores are mostly zero or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only point of contention is the risk scores in reports 2, 3, and 4, which are set at 0.1 or 0.2. Given that the code is purely for prompt generation and does not execute or handle sensitive data, a risk score of **0.0** is justified.\n- If considering potential prompt injection misuse in a deployment context, a very low risk score (e.g., 0.1) could be acceptable, but since the code itself is safe, **0.0** is preferable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all, as the code is benign and purely defines prompt templates.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments, but suggest setting the risk scores to 0 for all reports for accuracy.**",
