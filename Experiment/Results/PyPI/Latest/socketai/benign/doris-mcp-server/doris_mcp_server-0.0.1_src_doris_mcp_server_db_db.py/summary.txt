  "conclusion": "The code is a standard database connector with a notable security concern regarding SQL injection due to string formatting of user inputs. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score should be around 0.4 to accurately reflect the injection vulnerability. The main recommendation is to adopt parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks."
