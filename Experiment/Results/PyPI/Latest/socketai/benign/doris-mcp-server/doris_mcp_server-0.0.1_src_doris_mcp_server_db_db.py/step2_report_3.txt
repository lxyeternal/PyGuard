  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code constructs SQL queries via string formatting using user-controlled inputs (table_name, db, sql parameter in execute_query). This is a classic SQL injection risk.\n- The code does not use parameterized queries or input validation, which is a security concern.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior (e.g., backdoors, data exfiltration) is present in the code.\n- The code appears to be a standard database connector with a security flaw related to input sanitization.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly point out the SQL injection risk, which is accurate.\n- They assign a \"malware\" score of 0, which is appropriate since there's no malicious intent or behavior demonstrated.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are around 0.2 to 0.4, which seems reasonable given the identified vulnerability.\n- The reports do not mention whether the code could be exploited in practice or if the inputs are controlled. Without input validation, the risk is real if untrusted inputs are provided.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The \"malware\" score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are between 0.2 and 0.4, reflecting moderate risk due to SQL injection potential but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n- If inputs are controlled by an attacker, the risk of SQL injection could be high, possibly warranting a score closer to 0.7 or higher.\n- However, since the code itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior and is a standard connector, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n**Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n- The scores align with the identified vulnerability.\n- No overestimation of malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if there's an environment where inputs are untrusted, but based solely on the code, current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The main security concern is the SQL injection vulnerability due to string formatting.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code is a typical database connector with a common security flaw.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 to 0.4 (moderate, due to SQL injection risk if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the core security concern (SQL injection vulnerability) without overestimating malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. The main recommendation would be to implement parameterized queries or input validation to mitigate injection risks.",
