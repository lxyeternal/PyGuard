  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. The code constructs SQL queries via string formatting with user inputs (`table_name`, `db`) without sanitization, which is a known security risk.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly identifies the risk of SQL injection due to unparameterized query construction. No malicious intent is claimed or evidenced.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.4 seems reasonable; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The insecure handling of user input in SQL statements is a significant vulnerability but not necessarily malicious. The score of 0.4 is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Assumptions:** The report correctly states that this is a security concern but not malware.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Similar to report 1, the code constructs SQL queries with string formatting from user inputs without sanitization.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly notes the vulnerability to SQL injection.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.4 is appropriate; malware remains 0.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; insecure query construction without malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Assumptions:** No malicious activity assumed; just insecure coding pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same pattern of unsanitized input in SQL queries.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly identifies potential for SQL injection.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.4 is appropriate; malware 0.\n- **Justification:** The vulnerability is present but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 justified.\n- **Assumptions:** No malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same as above regarding SQL injection risk.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly notes the potential security issue.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.2 is slightly lower, possibly reflecting the perceived lower risk or less direct exposure, but still reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** 0 justified.\n- **Assumptions:** No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Similar pattern; no sanitization in query construction.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly notes the potential for injection but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.2 seems appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 justified.\n- **Assumptions:** No malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Assessment:\n- **Code behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code constructs SQL queries via string formatting with user inputs, which is a security concern but not malware.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the security concern about SQL injection.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the consistent pattern of insecure SQL query construction, I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.3**. It's a moderate security concern but not an immediate high risk, especially since there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in identifying the security vulnerability.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The main issue is insecure handling of user input leading to potential SQL injection, which should be addressed.\n\n**Recommendation:** The code should be refactored to use parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks, but there is no need to flag this as malware or malicious activity.",
