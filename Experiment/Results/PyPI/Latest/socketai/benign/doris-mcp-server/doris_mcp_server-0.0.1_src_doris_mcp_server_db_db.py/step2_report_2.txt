  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, the presence of malicious behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Findings Across Reports:**\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward database connector for Doris, establishing connections, executing queries, and retrieving schema info.\n- **Security Concerns:** The main issue identified is the use of string formatting to construct SQL queries with user-supplied inputs (`table_name`, `db`, and raw `sql`), which introduces SQL injection risks.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No reports identify any malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the injection vulnerability concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The main issue—unsanitized dynamic SQL—is consistently identified. No report claims the code is malicious or obfuscated.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical errors are evident.\n- **Score Reasonableness:**\n  - Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0.2–0.4 seems reasonable given the injection vulnerability.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- **Malware (0):** No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk (~0.2–0.4):** The main concern is SQL injection via unsanitized inputs. While this is a significant security concern, it does not constitute malware or malicious intent. The risk score should reflect the potential for exploitation, not actual malicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Risk Score Adjustment:** Given the consistent identification of SQL injection vulnerability, a security risk score of around 0.4 is justified, aligning with the higher end of the reports.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** Remain at 0, as no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Score Category | Justification |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0 — No malicious code or behavior observed. |\n| Obfuscated       | 0 — Code is clear and straightforward. |\n| Security Risk    | 0.4 — Notable SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized string formatting in SQL queries. This could be exploited if untrusted input reaches these functions. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard database connector with a security concern related to SQL injection. No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; I would keep malware and obfuscated at 0, and set security risk at approximately 0.4 to reflect the injection vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** To improve security, parameterized queries should be used instead of string formatting to prevent SQL injection.",
