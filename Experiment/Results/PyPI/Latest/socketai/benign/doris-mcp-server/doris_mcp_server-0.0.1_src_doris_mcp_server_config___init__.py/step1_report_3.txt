  "purpose": "This code imports configuration constants from a local module and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.config', specifically DB_CONFIG, MCP_SERVER_NAME, and DEBUG.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code only imports and exports constants.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local module '.config' to the current namespace, with no further data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious patterns or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific configuration variables from a relative module named '.config' and exposes them via __all__. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or unsafe operations. The code structure is standard for configuration management in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple configuration import module with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
