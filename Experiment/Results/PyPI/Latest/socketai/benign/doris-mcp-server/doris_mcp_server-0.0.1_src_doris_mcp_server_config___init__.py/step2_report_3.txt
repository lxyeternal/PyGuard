  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code snippet is a straightforward Python module that imports three configuration variables (`DB_CONFIG`, `MCP_SERVER_NAME`, `DEBUG`) from a local module named `.config` and then defines `__all__` to specify these as exported symbols. There are no operations, data transformations, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is simple and does not contain vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies. All reports correctly identify this as a standard configuration module.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  None. All reports agree on the benign nature of this code. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The scores are either `0` or very low (`0.1`). Given the code's simplicity and the absence of secrets or sensitive data handling, these scores are reasonable.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The reports mention \"hardcoded secrets\" as absent, which is correct.\n- The use of relative import `.config` is standard in Python packages and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  The current scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. Since there's no malicious or suspicious activity, scores should remain at zero or near-zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (appropriate, given the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard configuration import module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the true risk level.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the current reports and the code's actual content.",
