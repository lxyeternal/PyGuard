  "purpose": "Export configuration constants from a module for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads configuration variables from a local module named 'config'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'config' module into the current module via import, then into the module's namespace for export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three variables—DB_CONFIG, MCP_SERVER_NAME, and DEBUG—from a local module named 'config'. It then defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. There is no use of dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials within this snippet, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard practice for organizing configuration constants in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export of configuration variables with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard and appears safe.",
