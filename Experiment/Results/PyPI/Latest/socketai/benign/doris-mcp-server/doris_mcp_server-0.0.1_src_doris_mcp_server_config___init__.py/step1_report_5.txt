{
  "purpose": "The code exports configuration constants from a local module, likely for database and server configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .config: DB_CONFIG, MCP_SERVER_NAME, DEBUG",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and re-exports constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration variables from a local module and exposes them for external use via __all__. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a simple configuration re-export pattern common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard configuration module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
