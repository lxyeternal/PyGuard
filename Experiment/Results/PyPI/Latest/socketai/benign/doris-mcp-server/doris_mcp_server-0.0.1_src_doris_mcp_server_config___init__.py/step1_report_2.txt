  "purpose": "The code imports configuration constants from a local module and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module named .config, specifically the variables DB_CONFIG, MCP_SERVER_NAME, and DEBUG.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not perform any operations on data, nor does it write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing configuration variables from a local module, with no data flow beyond module importation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It is a straightforward import and export statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific configuration constants from a relative module and then declares them in __all__ for external access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and standard for Python package configuration modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration import module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or communication that could be malicious.",
