  "purpose": "Import configuration constants from a local module and expose them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .config module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; static import only",
  "flows": "Import from .config to module namespace, then export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports three configuration variables from a local module and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration module with no security issues or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
