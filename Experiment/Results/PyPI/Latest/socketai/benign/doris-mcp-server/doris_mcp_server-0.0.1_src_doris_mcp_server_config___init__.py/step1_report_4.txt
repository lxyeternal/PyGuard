{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports configuration settings from a local 'config' file and exports specific variables for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module '.config' which contains 'DB_CONFIG', 'MCP_SERVER_NAME', and 'DEBUG'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks within this snippet; it only imports and exposes configuration variables.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: data is imported from a local config module and then re-exported; no processing or data transformation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and standard. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of relative import indicates it's part of a package but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple configuration import module. It imports specific variables from a local 'config' module and exposes them publicly. There are no data processing, user input handling, or untrusted data flows. The code structure is standard and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration module with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It only imports and exposes configuration variables, which by itself pose no security risk.",
