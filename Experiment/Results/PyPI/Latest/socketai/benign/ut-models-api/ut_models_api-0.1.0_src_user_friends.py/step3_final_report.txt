{
  "purpose": "Defines static Pydantic data models for JSON schema validation related to user friends, notifications, metadata, and pagination.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions; no external input, network calls, or dynamic data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; data models are static and do not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo 'veunes' instead of 'venues' in UnreadCount class; no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, auto-generated, with no external data input, network activity, or code execution. The only anomaly is a minor typo that does not influence security. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code's static nature and straightforward schema definitions indicate zero malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo is a non-security concern. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) due to the typo are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
