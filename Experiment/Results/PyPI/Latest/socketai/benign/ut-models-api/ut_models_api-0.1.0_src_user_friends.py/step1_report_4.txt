  "purpose": "Define data models for handling friends-related JSON data, including user info, response times, notifications, and pagination.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and pydantic; class definitions with static data structures.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, input handling, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON data mapped into these models; no external data processing or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines data schemas without dynamic code execution or external calls. Note a typo in 'veunes' which appears to be a misspelling of 'venues', but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static data models using pydantic, with no functions, input handling, or external interactions. The presence of configuration for immutability (frozen=True) indicates an emphasis on data integrity. No code injections, network activities, or dynamic evaluations are present. The typo 'veunes' could be a benign mistake or typo, but it does not impact security. Overall, the code is purely schema definition with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static data model definitions for JSON data, with no signs of malicious intent, external data handling, or security risks. It is safe from supply chain attacks or malware within the scope of these class definitions.",
