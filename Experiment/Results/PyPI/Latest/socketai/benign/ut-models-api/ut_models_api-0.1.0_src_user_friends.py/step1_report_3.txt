  "purpose": "Defines data models for user friends data, including meta information, notifications, and response data.",
  "sources": "No input reading; the code only defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to data definitions without processing logic; no source-to-sink flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'veunes' instead of 'venues' in UnreadCount; no security-related anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Pydantic for immutable data models with clear structure. It contains no input/output handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is the typo 'veunes,' which does not affect security. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation present. The structure is straightforward, purely defining data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as data model definitions for a larger application context. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
