{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a beer-related API response using pydantic for validation and immutability.",
  "sources": "Data is received from external API responses or data inputs, primarily through pydantic model parsing.",
  "targets": "The data models are used internally within the application; no explicit data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into pydantic models for validation and then is used internally; no external sink or malicious data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple pydantic data models used for validating and representing structured data, with configurations set for immutability (frozen). There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could indicate malicious behavior. The models include various attributes for beer, brewery, user notifications, and metadata, all of which are typical for an API data schema. No suspicious functions, hidden behaviors, or external system interactions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data model definitions intended for use in an API context. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe for use.",
