  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of immutable data models for a beer-related API, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo does not constitute a security concern. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero. The models are safe for use in production environments."
