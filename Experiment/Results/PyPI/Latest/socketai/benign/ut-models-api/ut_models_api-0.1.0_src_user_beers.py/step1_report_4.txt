  "purpose": "Data model definitions generated by datamodel-codegen for representing beer-related data and metadata, intended for use with Pydantic validation.",
  "sources": "No input sources, data is static model definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code contains only class definitions without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward data models without dynamic or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic BaseModel classes with frozen configurations for data validation. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present. The models include fields for various attributes related to beers, breweries, user interactions, and metadata. The code appears to be auto-generated data structure definitions for a backend or API client, with no indications of malicious behavior or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of static data model definitions generated by a code generator. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use as intended for data validation and modeling.",
