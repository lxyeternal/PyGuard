  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is generated by datamodel-codegen, consisting solely of pydantic models. No executable code, network calls, or data processing. The only concern is the use of 'Any' in 'contact' and 'settings', which could mask malicious input, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely data schema with no active logic. The minor concern about 'Any' is acknowledged but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the 'Any' types and a typo ('veunes' instead of 'venues'). No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk due to 'Any' and typo, but overall still just data models.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—data schemas with no dynamic code, network activity, or input processing. 'Any' types are noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, purely structural.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no active code, just data models. 'Any' types are a minor concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are fitting.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—data schemas with no executable or malicious behavior. Typographical inconsistency noted but not security relevant.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Structural data models, no active logic.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely data schema definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) due to the use of 'Any' types and minor typos. These are valid concerns but do not elevate the risk to a significant level.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minor concerns about 'Any' types and typos, but overall safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, auto-generated set of data models with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor concerns do not warrant higher risk scores.",
