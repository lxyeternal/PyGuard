  "purpose": "Define data models for user-related responses, including user profile, stats, notifications, and metadata.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data directly; it primarily defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are model definitions; there are no active data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are present. The models are straightforward data containers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple Pydantic data models used for structured data serialization/deserialization. It includes annotations for immutability via ConfigDict(frozen=True). There are no input/output operations, network communications, or code execution. All fields are standard data types. The presence of 'Any' type for contact and settings is noted but not malicious; it may imply flexible or incomplete typing. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. Overall, this code serves as a schema definition with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining data schemas for user-related information. It does not include any malicious behavior, suspicious actions, or security risks. No malware, backdoors, or data leaks are indicated.",
