  "purpose": "A trivial function returning a static greeting string, with no external inputs or suspicious behaviors.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity. No logical flaws or security issues are present. The code poses no threat, and the analysis is consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
