  "purpose": "Analysis of suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network activity in the Python dependency to assess potential malicious intent and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() functions, hardcoded URLs/IPs, environment variables, input streams, obfuscated variable names, network calls, subprocess executions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), system commands, environment variables, file operations, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (eval/exec, environment, input streams) leading to code execution, network transmission, or system modifications; obfuscation complicates analysis but does not alter flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation levels, dynamic code execution with untrusted data, hardcoded network addresses, lack of documentation, complex indirect function calls, inconsistent variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and network activity, which are typical indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious code. No explicit malicious payloads like data theft, backdoors, or crypto-mining are confirmed, but the patterns suggest a moderate to high security concern. The obfuscation and dynamic execution increase the risk profile, especially if the code is untrusted. Scores are adjusted to reflect these behaviors, with malware scores around 0.5, obfuscation around 0.6, and security risk around 0.55, aligning with the cautious interpretation of the suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are typical in malicious or risky supply chain components. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the behaviors warrant a cautious approach, assigning moderate malware and risk scores. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
