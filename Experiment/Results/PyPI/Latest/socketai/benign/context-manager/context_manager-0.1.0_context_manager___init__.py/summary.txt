  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are typical in malicious or risky supply chain components. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the behaviors warrant a cautious approach, assigning moderate malware and risk scores. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
