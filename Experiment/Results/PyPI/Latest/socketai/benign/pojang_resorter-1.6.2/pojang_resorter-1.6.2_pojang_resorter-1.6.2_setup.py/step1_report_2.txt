{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with custom post-install behavior to execute an internal script.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables indirectly through subprocess and os.path; it also reads files like 'pojang_resorter/utilities.py'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes a Python script located within the package, potentially executing untrusted code if the script is tampered with.",
  "flows": "After installation, the custom run method constructs a path to 'utilities.py' and executes it with '--run' argument, which can execute code within that script.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs an internal Python script during installation without validation or security checks, which could be exploited if the script is malicious or modified. No validation of the script's contents occurs before execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script employs a custom install command to run an internal script post-installation. It constructs the path to 'utilities.py' within the package and executes it if present. This behavior can be risky if the script is malicious or altered maliciously, as it runs arbitrary code during installation. The package's dependencies and data files appear normal. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or suspicious patterns beyond the execution of an internal script. No external network activity or malicious payloads are directly evident, but executing code during install without validation is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package runs an internal Python script during installation without validation, posing a potential security risk if that script is malicious or compromised. This behavior warrants caution, as arbitrary code execution at install time can be exploited.",
