  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an internal script during setup without validation or integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after standard installation, constructs a path to 'utilities.py' within the package directory. If the file exists, it executes it via subprocess.run(['python', exe_path, '--run']) without any validation, signature verification, or sandboxing. This behavior introduces a significant security risk, as malicious or tampered code in 'utilities.py' would run during installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but executing untrusted code unconditionally is inherently dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the behavior, the malware score should be high (around 0.7-0.8), and the security risk should also be elevated (around 0.75-0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an internal script during setup without validation is a serious security concern. It can be exploited if 'utilities.py' is malicious or compromised. The current reports recognize this risk, but the malware scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this pattern warrants caution, and best practices would include validation, signatures, or sandboxing before executing such scripts.",
