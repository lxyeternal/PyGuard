  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an internal script during setup without validation is a serious security concern. It can be exploited if 'utilities.py' is malicious or compromised. The current reports recognize this risk, but the malware scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this pattern warrants caution, and best practices would include validation, signatures, or sandboxing before executing such scripts."
