  "purpose": "This code contains only a module-level docstring indicating miscellaneous functions, with no actual implementation or executable code.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment or docstring present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only a descriptive comment or docstring with no code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is purely a comment or docstring with no functions, variables, imports, or executable code. As such, there are no data flows, sources, sinks, or behaviors that could indicate malicious activity or security risks. The lack of code means no potential for code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the content. Confidence levels are high given the minimal and benign nature of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign placeholder comment with no executable or malicious content. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. No further action or concern is warranted based on this content.",
