  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas for Wago 750 device settings including channels, modules, and hub parameters.",
  "sources": "User-provided configuration input for hostnames, ports, module and channel details",
  "sinks": "Potentially the data used to establish network connections (host, port) and generate IDs",
  "flows": "Configuration input -> Validation/Parsing -> Usage in network connections or identification processes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models using Pydantic for configuration purposes. It includes properties to generate IDs based on module and channel data. The network-related parameters such as host and port are only used as configuration inputs, with no code that directly uses them to establish connections. No input processing, network calls, or data leaks are present within this module. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for configuration schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of configuration models with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It contains no active network operations or data handling that could be exploited. The code appears safe, with no security risks identified.",
