  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining data models with no active data processing, network operations, or external calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code uses standard practices with Pydantic models, default values, and simple ID generation properties.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Configuration models for Wago 750.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Configuration models, with data flowing from input sources.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Configuration schemas, reading external input.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar configuration models.\n- **Findings:** No malicious logic, no external command execution.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Configuration schemas with user input for network parameters.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, only configuration data.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative configuration data models.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None observed or reported.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent and justified given the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, appropriately reflecting no security risk.\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on assumptions; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No security concerns or malicious activity are present. The code is a standard, safe configuration schema for Wago 750 devices.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized official review or any further analysis?**",
