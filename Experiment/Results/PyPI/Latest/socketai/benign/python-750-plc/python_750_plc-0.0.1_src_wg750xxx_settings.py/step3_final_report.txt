  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas for Wago 750 devices, including channels, modules, hub, and Modbus settings.",
  "sources": "Input attributes used in ID generation properties and data validation fields.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model fields and ID properties, but no active data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard data models with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic models for configuration, with no external calls, network operations, or malicious logic. ID properties generate identifiers based on input attributes, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the code as safe and purely declarative. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward set of configuration schemas with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
