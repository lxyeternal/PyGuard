  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas for Wago 750 device settings including channels, modules, hub, and Modbus parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from external configuration files or user input to instantiate configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly creates data models without executing external commands or data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into configuration objects, but no transformation or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Pydantic models for device configuration with properties generating unique IDs. No external data processing, command execution, or network activity occurs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration data model implementation for a Wago 750 setup. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
