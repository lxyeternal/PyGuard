  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a Wago 750 controller interface with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is justified at 0.2 due to inherent network and hardware interaction risks but no active threats."
