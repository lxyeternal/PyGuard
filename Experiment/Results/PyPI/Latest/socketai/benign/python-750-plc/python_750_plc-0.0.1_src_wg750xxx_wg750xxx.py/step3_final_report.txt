{
  "purpose": "Management and communication with Wago 750 controllers over Modbus TCP, including device discovery, configuration, and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Register reads from device memory, network responses from Modbus client, internal configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "Data read from registers, network responses; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads from device registers to internal state, configuration data to device, network responses to internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, assertions used for validation are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard device management functions for Wago controllers, including register reading, device discovery, and configuration management. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Network interactions are typical for industrial control systems. Assertions serve as validation checks, not malicious triggers. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a Wago 750 controller interface with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is justified at 0.2 due to inherent network and hardware interaction risks but no active threats.",
