  "purpose": "Export a class named PLCHub from the local module 'wg750xxx' for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'PLCHub' from a local module, and the list __all__ for export declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to security issues are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a local module and declares it for public export. There are no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data sources. The structure is typical for Python modules defining exports. The context 'Wago 750 PLC' suggests this is part of a hardware control library, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase for hardware interaction.",
