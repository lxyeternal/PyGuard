  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Standard Python setup script.\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Uses setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, user input, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Mistakes, or Logical Errors:\n- **Any errors?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- **Any higher scores?**  \n  No. All reports assign 0 for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.  \n- The reports' malware scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard packaging script.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or dependencies that could introduce risks, but based on this static analysis, the code is safe.",
