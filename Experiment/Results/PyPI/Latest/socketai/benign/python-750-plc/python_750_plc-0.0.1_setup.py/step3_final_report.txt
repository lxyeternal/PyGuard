  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the wg750xxx Python module, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external communication, or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration without dynamic or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README.md file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or external data handling. The code structure is simple, readable, and follows best practices. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The uniform reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with full confidence. The analysis confirms that the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are appropriate. The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.",
