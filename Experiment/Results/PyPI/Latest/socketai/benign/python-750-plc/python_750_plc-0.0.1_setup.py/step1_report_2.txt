{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for configuring and installing the wg750xxx Python module, which interacts with WAGO 750 series PLCs via Modbus TCP.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to obtain the long description for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define package configuration; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads file input (README.md) -> passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; standard use of setup.py with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup operations, including reading a README file and configuring package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. Usage of third-party dependencies is appropriate and standard for a setup script. The code structure and content are consistent with normal Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package configuration and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
