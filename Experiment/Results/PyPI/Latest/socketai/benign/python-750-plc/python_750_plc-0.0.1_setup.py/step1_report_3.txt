{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the wg750xxx Python module, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies; package discovery via setuptools.find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no input/output to external sources; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup script solely defines static configuration and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file to include as a long description, which is standard practice. It sets package metadata such as name, version, author, and dependencies. The dependencies listed are typical for such a package and do not contain any suspicious or malicious libraries. The use of setuptools for package discovery and configuration is standard and secure. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is apparent. The script does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. Overall, the code is straightforward, standard, and does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions solely to configure and prepare the package for distribution.",
