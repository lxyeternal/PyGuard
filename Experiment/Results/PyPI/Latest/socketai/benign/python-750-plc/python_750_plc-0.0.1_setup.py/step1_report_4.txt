  "purpose": "Setup script for the wg750xxx Python module, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; no other external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as untrusted data handling, network calls, or execution points that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script solely performs package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code follows standard setup procedures with no suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path from pathlib and setuptools for package setup. It reads the README.md file for long_description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All operations are standard for a Python package setup, with no indication of malicious behavior or hidden code. The dependencies listed (pymodbus, pyyaml) are common and benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
