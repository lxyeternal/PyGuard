  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class WagoException for handling Wago PLC errors, appending error descriptions from ERROR_CODES if provided.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'message' and 'error_code' in the constructor, and the imported ERROR_CODES dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(message) passes the message to the base Exception class; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Error_code validation and message construction flow from constructor input to super().__init__ call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward error handling code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard custom exception class that enhances error messages with descriptions from an external ERROR_CODES dictionary. It uses modern Python syntax and performs validation to include error descriptions if available. The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The error message construction is safe within the context, and the overall logic is typical for error handling in Python. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
