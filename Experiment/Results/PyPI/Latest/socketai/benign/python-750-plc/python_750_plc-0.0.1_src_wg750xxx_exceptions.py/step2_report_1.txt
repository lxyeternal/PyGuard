  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a custom exception class `WagoException` for handling Wago PLC errors.\n- Imports `ERROR_CODES` from a local module.\n- The constructor appends an error description from `ERROR_CODES` if `error_code` is provided and valid.\n- Uses modern Python syntax (`int | None`) but no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- No external side effects, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The purpose is straightforward error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n- The logic is standard for custom exception classes.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose matches the code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, malware, or security risks.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and analysis.\n- Notes potential for untrusted data in `super().__init__(message)`, but in context, `message` is constructed internally, so risk is minimal.\n- No malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- Highlights that the code relies on an external module, which is benign.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Standard error handling pattern.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No report suggests any vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured custom exception class for error handling in an industrial context, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
