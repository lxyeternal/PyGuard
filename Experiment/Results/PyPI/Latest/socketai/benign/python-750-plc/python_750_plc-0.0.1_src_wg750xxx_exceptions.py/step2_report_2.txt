  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a custom exception class `WagoException` for handling errors related to Wago PLC devices.\n- It imports `ERROR_CODES` from a local module `.const`.\n- The constructor optionally appends a descriptive message from `ERROR_CODES` if `error_code` is provided and valid.\n- The code uses modern Python syntax (`int | None`) and standard exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are identified across reports.  \n- The logic is standard for custom exception classes, with proper validation of `error_code`.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious intent. This aligns with the code's behavior—it's purely for error messaging.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, as the code does not perform any external operations, network calls, or data leaks.\n\n### Justification for any high risk scores:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk higher than 0.5. The code is a simple exception class with no side effects.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code relies on an external `ERROR_CODES` dictionary, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n- No suspicious or malicious assumptions are made about the `ERROR_CODES` content.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical, well-implemented custom exception class.\n- The only potential concern could be if `ERROR_CODES` contained malicious entries, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet. Given the context, it's reasonable to trust the `ERROR_CODES` dictionary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and performs its intended purpose without security risks. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\nIf you have any specific concerns or additional context, please share.",
