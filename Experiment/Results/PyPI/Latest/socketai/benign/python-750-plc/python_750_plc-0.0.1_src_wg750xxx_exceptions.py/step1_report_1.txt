  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Wago PLC errors, incorporating error codes from a constants module.",
  "sources": "Error codes imported from the .const module (ERROR_CODES).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data processing or output handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The error_code parameter influences the exception message if it exists and is in ERROR_CODES.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports error codes from a constants module, defines a custom exception class, and customizes its message based on the provided error code. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The use of type annotations including 'int | None' suggests modern Python syntax, but nothing malicious. The class serves a clear purpose of error handling without performing any side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class for Wago PLC errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and intended for error management.",
