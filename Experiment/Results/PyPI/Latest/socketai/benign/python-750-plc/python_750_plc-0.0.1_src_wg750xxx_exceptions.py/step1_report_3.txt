  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Wago PLC error handling, utilizing external error code mappings.",
  "sources": "ERROR_CODES imported from .const module",
  "sinks": "super().__init__(message) potentially passes untrusted or malformed messages to base Exception",
  "flows": "Error code validation from ERROR_CODES -> message formatting -> Exception initialization",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that enhances error messages with external error code descriptions from ERROR_CODES. It checks if the provided error_code exists in ERROR_CODES before appending the description, which is a standard and safe practice. The class is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. It relies on an external module for error codes, which appears benign. No suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet. It appears safe and typical for such applications.",
