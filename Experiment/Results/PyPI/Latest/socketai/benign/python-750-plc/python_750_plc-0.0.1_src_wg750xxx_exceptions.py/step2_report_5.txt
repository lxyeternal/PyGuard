  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports agree that the code defines a custom exception class `WagoException` that incorporates error descriptions from an imported `ERROR_CODES` dictionary.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The logic of appending error descriptions to messages based on error codes is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No report indicates any actual vulnerabilities, such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic.\n   - The only minor point is that the `message` parameter could be influenced if external input is not sanitized elsewhere, but this is typical for exception messages and not inherently risky here.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration, and the error handling is standard, the risk scores should remain low.\n   - The only potential concern is if the `message` parameter is influenced by untrusted input elsewhere in the application, but within this snippet, it’s not evident.\n\n5. **Malware & Obfuscated Scores**:\n   - Both scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n   - No signs of malware or obfuscation are evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is benign and typical for error handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, standard custom exception class for error handling, relying on a predefined error code dictionary. It does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or insecure operations. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**In conclusion**, I agree with the provided assessments. No changes are necessary.",
