  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Wago PLC error codes with descriptive messages.",
  "sources": "The code imports ERROR_CODES from a local module and uses it to generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs exception messages that may include error descriptions from ERROR_CODES.",
  "flows": "Error code (error_code) is checked against ERROR_CODES and used to augment exception message, potentially affecting error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs straightforward exception handling without any hidden or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ERROR_CODES and defines WagoException to include a message and optional error code. If an error_code is provided and exists in ERROR_CODES, it appends the corresponding error description to the message. The implementation appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure and logic are clear, and there are no external data sources or sink points that could be exploited maliciously. The code simply enhances exception messages with predefined error descriptions, which is typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward custom exception class for Wago PLC errors. It performs standard error message augmentation using a local error code dictionary. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code appears safe and conventional.",
