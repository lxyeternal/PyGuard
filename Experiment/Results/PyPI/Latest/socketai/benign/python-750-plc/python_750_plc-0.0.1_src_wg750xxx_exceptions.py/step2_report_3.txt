  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their claims, the correctness of their scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward custom exception class that enhances error messages with descriptions from an imported ERROR_CODES dictionary.\n- All reports agree that the code is simple, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any external network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leakage.\n- The only potential concern is the inclusion of untrusted data in exception messages, but since the message is constructed from a static message and optional error code descriptions, this is a common pattern in error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It correctly checks if `error_code` exists in `ERROR_CODES` before appending the description.\n- The use of `int | None` is modern Python syntax, not suspicious.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- No logical or security flaws are evident.\n- The only minor note is that the message could potentially include untrusted data if `message` is externally influenced, but this is typical in exception handling and not inherently insecure.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since the code is a simple exception class with no external calls, no data leaks, and no obfuscation, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The malware score should also be **0** due to the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0** as well.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The only potential for concern is if `message` is influenced by untrusted sources, but this is typical in exception messages and not necessarily a security flaw unless the message is directly exposed in a way that could cause issues (e.g., injection). The code itself does not perform such exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is legitimate, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scoring in all reports aligns with the code's characteristics.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware concerns. The scores are appropriate as given.",
