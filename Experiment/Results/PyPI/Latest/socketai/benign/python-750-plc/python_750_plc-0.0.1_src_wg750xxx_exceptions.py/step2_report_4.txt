  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code defines a custom exception class `WagoException` that enhances error messages with descriptions from an imported `ERROR_CODES` dictionary.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard exception handling, and has no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n   - The logic is simple: if an `error_code` is provided and exists in `ERROR_CODES`, it appends the description to the message.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not perform any malicious actions, external communications, or data leaks.\n   - The mention of the `message` potentially being influenced by external data is noted, but since `message` is passed as an argument, and the code does not process or execute it, this is standard behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code only formats error messages based on predefined error codes.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - The code does not contain any malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security implications are inferred.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores align well with the analysis; no inconsistencies are evident.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a clean, standard implementation of a custom exception class for error handling.\n- It does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (a very low risk, primarily because it’s error handling code, but minimal risk exists if error messages are externally influenced, which is unlikely here)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for error management in a Wago PLC context. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are present.",
