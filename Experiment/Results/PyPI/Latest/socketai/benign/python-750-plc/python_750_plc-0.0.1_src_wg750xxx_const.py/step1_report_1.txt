  "purpose": "Define constants and error codes for WAGO wg750xxx module configuration and communication.",
  "sources": "None (constants and static mappings only).",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants are used for configuration purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of straightforward constant definitions and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares default network parameters (host, port, interval, timeout) and a dictionary of error codes mapped to messages. There are no functions, no data processing, and no untrusted input handling. It does not contain any network communication, code execution, or suspicious constructs. The structure and content are typical for configuration constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears to be standard configuration constants for a hardware module.",
