  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of static constant definitions: network parameters (`DEFAULT_HOST`, `DEFAULT_PORT`, etc.) and an error code dictionary (`ERROR_CODES`). There are no functions, dynamic logic, data processing, or external inputs.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, static, and benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior. They correctly identify the code as configuration constants without any security risks.  \n   **Conclusion**: No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`. These are appropriate given the code's nature.  \n   **Suggestion**: The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely static configuration data, there's no justification for higher risk scores.  \n   **Conclusion**: The risk scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's content. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion**: The malware score is justified as 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a simple, static configuration snippet with no malicious or suspicious content.  \n- The reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are correct, and no changes are necessary.",
