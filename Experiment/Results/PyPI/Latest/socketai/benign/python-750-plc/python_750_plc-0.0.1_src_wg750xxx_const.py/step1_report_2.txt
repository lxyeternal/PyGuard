{
  "purpose": "Define constants and error codes for the WAGO wg750xxx module, likely for communication or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Default host IP, default port, scan interval, timeout, and error code mappings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or input/output flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond IP and port), or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions: IP address, port number, timing interval, timeout duration, and a dictionary of error codes. All are static values without any dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The constants are typical for network communication setup and error handling in embedded or industrial control systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining static constants for use in communication with a device. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
