  "purpose": "Define constants for WAGO wg750xxx module configuration and error codes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded default host IP, default port, scan interval, timeout, and error code mappings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions without complex or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration parameters and error code mappings for a hardware module. All values are hardcoded constants with no dynamic code execution, user input, or external data dependencies. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of configuration constants and error codes for a hardware module. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
