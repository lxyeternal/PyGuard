  "purpose": "Static configuration constants for network parameters and error codes related to the WAGO wg750xxx module.",
  "sources": "Definitions of DEFAULT_HOST, DEFAULT_PORT, DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, and ERROR_CODES dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static constants do not process external data.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions and a dictionary mapping error codes to messages. There are no functions, input handling, network communication, or dynamic logic. The constants are typical configuration parameters for network communication with the WAGO module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
