  "purpose": "Define constants and error codes for WAGO wg750xxx module communication",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static constants defined in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains predefined constants and an error code dictionary. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic execution, or network operations. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for configuration or constants definitions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants and error code declaration for a device module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
