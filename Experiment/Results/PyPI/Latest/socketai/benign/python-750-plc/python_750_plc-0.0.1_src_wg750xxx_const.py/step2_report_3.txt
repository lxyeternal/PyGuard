  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constants and error code mappings.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network communication, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and purely declarative.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious behavior, straightforward constants.\n- Score justification: malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **No issues.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- **No issues.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- **No issues.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, static configuration constants.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- **No issues.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion, straightforward constants.\n- Scores are consistent.\n- **No issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code contains only static constants and error code mappings, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score above 0.5. The code is purely static configuration.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since there's no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static nature of the code.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code, I agree with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.**\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward set of configuration constants with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. No adjustments needed.",
