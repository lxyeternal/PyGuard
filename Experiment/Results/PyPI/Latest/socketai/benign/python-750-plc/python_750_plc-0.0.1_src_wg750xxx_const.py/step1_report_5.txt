  "purpose": "Define constants for the WAGO wg750xxx module, including network settings and error codes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; constants are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present as this is simply a constants definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets beyond typical configuration constants are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions: IP address, port, scan interval, timeout, and a dictionary of error codes. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing are involved. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. This appears to be standard configuration data for a network device module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constants definition for device configuration and error codes with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
