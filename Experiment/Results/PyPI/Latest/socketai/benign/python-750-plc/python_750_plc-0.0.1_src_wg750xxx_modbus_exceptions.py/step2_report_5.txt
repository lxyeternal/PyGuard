  "review": "Let's review the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n- No input/output operations, no untrusted data handling, no network calls, no code execution, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as an error handling hierarchy.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- No logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent and accurate given the code.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate, considering the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for any high risk scores (>0.5):**\n- Since all scores are zero, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n- The code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No signs of malware, such as code injection, payloads, or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**- Malware score:** 0  \n**- Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**- Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious features. It is a standard pattern in Python for error handling, with no external dependencies or data flows that could introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes or escalations are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code remains simple and free of malicious constructs in future reviews.",
