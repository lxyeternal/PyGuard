  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the modbus package to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication points.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines classes without operational flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception. There are no input/output operations, data handling, network calls, or obfuscation. The code is standard, well-structured, and serves as a foundation for error handling in the modbus package. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The uniform reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high confidence scores. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
