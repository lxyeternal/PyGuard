  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a simple set of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, no network calls, or any dynamic behavior. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. No logical errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security risk: 0  \n   These are consistent with the code's nature. Since there's no malicious behavior, these scores seem appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unfounded assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Python package. It does not pose any security risks, does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and has no anomalies. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
