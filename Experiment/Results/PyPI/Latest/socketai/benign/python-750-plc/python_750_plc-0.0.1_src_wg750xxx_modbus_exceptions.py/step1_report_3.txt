  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the modbus package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. Each class is used for specific error handling within the modbus package, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python practices for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as a standard part of the package's error handling mechanism.",
