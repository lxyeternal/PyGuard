{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the modbus package.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present; no untrusted data handling or leakage occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output, as the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations inheriting from a base Exception class. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The classes serve as structured error types for a modbus communication library, which is a standard pattern in Python coding. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical, benign exception hierarchy for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception definitions for a modbus library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, poses no security risk, and does not involve any external data handling.",
