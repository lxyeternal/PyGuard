  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the modbus package.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and typical for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for a modbus package, inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no input sources, data handling, or external interactions. The structure is simple and standard for defining specific exception types, with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a modbus library. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
