  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the modbus package.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; no data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from the base Exception class. Each class is documented with a descriptive docstring and has no methods or attributes beyond inheritance. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden code, or obfuscated elements. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle specific modbus-related errors within a larger application, without any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a modbus package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
