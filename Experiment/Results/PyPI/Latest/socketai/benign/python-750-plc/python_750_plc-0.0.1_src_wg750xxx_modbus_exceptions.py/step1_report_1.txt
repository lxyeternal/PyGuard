  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or input/output processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the modbus package, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no input/output operations, no use of untrusted data, network calls, or code execution. It appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
