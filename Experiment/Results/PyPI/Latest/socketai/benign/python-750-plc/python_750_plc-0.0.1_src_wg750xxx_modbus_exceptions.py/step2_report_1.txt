  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for a modbus package.\n   - All classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, and contain no methods, attributes, or external data handling.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Report Summaries**:\n   - All five reports uniformly state that the code is standard, benign, and solely for defining exception classes.\n   - They note the absence of input/output operations, untrusted data handling, or external communication.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n   - Confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Assessment of Malware and Security Risks**:\n   - Since the code is purely structural and involves no data processing, network calls, or external interactions, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The security risk is also effectively zero, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Exception class definitions are common in Python packages for error handling.\n   - They serve as a foundation for more complex error management but do not pose security concerns themselves.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly **0**.\n- The risk score should be **0**, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a modbus library, with no security issues or malicious behavior detected. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
