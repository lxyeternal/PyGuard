{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python package interface for Modbus communication with the wg750xxx module, including exception handling and state management classes.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package: .exceptions and .state",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or file operations",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules only; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; purely structural import statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from local modules and defines the __all__ list to specify exported names. No dynamic code execution, external network interactions, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code serves as an interface aggregation module with no embedded logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward module interface aggregator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports classes and exceptions for external use.",
