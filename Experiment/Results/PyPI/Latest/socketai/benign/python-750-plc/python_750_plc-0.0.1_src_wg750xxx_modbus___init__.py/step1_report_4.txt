  "purpose": "To define and export modules and exceptions related to Modbus communication for the wg750xxx device.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .exceptions and .state",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only imports and exports classes and exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely organizes imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception and state classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or include dynamic code execution. It appears to be a straightforward module organization file. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a module aggregator, importing necessary classes and re-exporting them. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security issues, or suspicious activity.",
