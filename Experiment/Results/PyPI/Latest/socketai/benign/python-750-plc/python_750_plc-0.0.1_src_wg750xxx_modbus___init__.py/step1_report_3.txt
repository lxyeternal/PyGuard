{
  "purpose": "To define and export classes and exceptions related to the Modbus protocol for the wg750xxx module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules .exceptions and .state",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Imports serve as source of classes and exceptions, exported via __all__ for external use",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and exceptions from internal submodules, then defines __all__ for export. It appears to be a typical package __init__.py file. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. The code's structure and content are standard for Python package initialization, with no external data input or processing flows that could introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports selected classes and exceptions for external use, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
