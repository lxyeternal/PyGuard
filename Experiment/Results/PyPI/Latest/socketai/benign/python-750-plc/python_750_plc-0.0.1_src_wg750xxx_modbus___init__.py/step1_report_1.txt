{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the Modbus protocol, including importing exceptions and state classes related to Modbus communication, for the wg750xxx module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .exceptions and .state.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing classes and re-exporting them; no data processing or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific exception and state classes from local modules and then defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual code patterns. The structure suggests a typical modular setup for a hardware communication package, with no external network interactions, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious module defining imports and exports for a Modbus communication package. No security risks or malware indications are observed.",
