{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python package interface for interacting with the wg750xxx module via Modbus protocol, primarily defining imports and exports for exception handling and state management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exceptions and .state)",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports and exports classes and exceptions, with no data flow or logic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and appears to serve as an interface or API layer",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from local modules and defines an export list. There are no data processing, user input, network communication, or other typical sources and sinks. The structure is simple, serving as an interface for a Modbus communication package, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, straightforward module for managing imports and exports in a Modbus communication package. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
