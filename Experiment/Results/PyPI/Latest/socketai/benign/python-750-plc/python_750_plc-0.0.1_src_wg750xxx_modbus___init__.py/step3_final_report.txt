{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface aggregator for the Modbus communication package, importing exception and state classes from local submodules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from .exceptions and .state modules",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export structure with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file that imports specific classes and exceptions, then defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or obfuscation. The absence of any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and minimal security risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
