  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading beyond the standard setup call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs or network communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the setup() function does not process external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, and does not include hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. It performs a typical package setup with no additional logic, inputs, or outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The simplicity and standard pattern indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
