{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a library and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive information exposure points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code executes a straightforward import and function call.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no apparent anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library, which is standard for packaging Python projects, and calls the setup() function with default parameters. There are no parameters provided to customize the build, and no additional code that could contain malicious payloads. The simplicity indicates it's a typical package setup script without malicious intent or malicious payloads embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic setup file for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs standard package setup operations without any suspicious activity.",
