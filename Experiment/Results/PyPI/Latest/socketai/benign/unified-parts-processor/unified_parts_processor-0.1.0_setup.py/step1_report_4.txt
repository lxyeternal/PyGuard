{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple setup script using setuptools to package a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls the 'setup()' function, which typically reads metadata and configuration from setup.py or related files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the setup() function does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The script imports a module and executes a single function call; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimalistic with no embedded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual constructs. It appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes setup() with default parameters, indicating a typical package setup process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The simplicity and conventional structure reduce suspicion. Since the code lacks additional logic or dynamic code execution, there are no hidden malicious intentions or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script that appears benign. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
