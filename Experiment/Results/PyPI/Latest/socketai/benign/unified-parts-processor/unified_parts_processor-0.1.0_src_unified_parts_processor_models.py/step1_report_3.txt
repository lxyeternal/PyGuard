{
  "purpose": "Define an ORM model for a 'devices' table in a PostgreSQL database to store device information.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy and a local database module; class attributes defining database columns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code is a static schema definition with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only declares a data model schema.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a SQLAlchemy ORM class representing a database table. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with descriptive docstring, and sets up columns with appropriate data types and constraints. There are no dynamic or user-input-driven operations, no network calls, and no execution of untrusted input. It strictly models database structure without including code that could be malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ORM schema definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely declarative and appears safe.",
