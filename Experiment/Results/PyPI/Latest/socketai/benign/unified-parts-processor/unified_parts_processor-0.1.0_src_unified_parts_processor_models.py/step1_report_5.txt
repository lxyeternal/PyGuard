{
  "purpose": "Define an ORM model for a 'devices' table in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy and a local database base; class attribute definitions for database columns.",
  "sinks": "Database ORM mappings, no external data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Class definition creates schema mapping, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy components and defines a Device class inheriting from Base, representing a database table. It includes typical ORM column definitions for device attributes, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. The model's purpose is to facilitate database interactions, and all code appears standard and secure. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model for device data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines database schema mappings using SQLAlchemy. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
