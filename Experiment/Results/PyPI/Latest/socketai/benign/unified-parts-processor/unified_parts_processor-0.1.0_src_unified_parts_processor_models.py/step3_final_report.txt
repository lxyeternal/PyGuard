  "purpose": "Defines a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'devices' table with device attributes.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules and defines class attributes mapping to database columns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; purely schema definition.",
  "flows": "Class attributes map directly to database columns; no data flow involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM schema with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 is an overestimation; it should be adjusted to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard ORM schema with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments are accurate; the only correction needed is to set the security risk score to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
