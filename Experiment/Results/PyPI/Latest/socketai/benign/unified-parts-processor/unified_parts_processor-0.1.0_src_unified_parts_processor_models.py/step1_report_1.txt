{
  "purpose": "Define an ORM model for a device entry in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy and local database module, class attributes defining database columns.",
  "sinks": "Database ORM layer, potential data insertion or retrieval points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., user input, external data) into ORM attributes; then into database storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or hidden behaviors. No unusual code patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM model with no dynamic execution, no external input handling, and no network activity. It imports only necessary modules, declares a class representing a database table with standard columns, and includes clear docstrings. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Usage appears standard for database ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and contains no suspicious or malicious content.",
