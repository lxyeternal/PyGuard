  "purpose": "The package is designed to facilitate uploading pandas DataFrames into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources within this code snippet; relies on imported modules (Database, DataUploader) which may handle data.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data outputs in this code snippet; potential risks depend on the implementation within imported modules.",
  "flows": "Not observable in this snippet; likely involves external data passing through imported classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an entry point module, importing core components and defining metadata. It lacks any logic, data handling, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable within this fragment. Since actual functionality resides in imported modules, their code would need review for security issues, but this snippet alone does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer with no evident malicious or security-threatening behavior. It simply imports and exposes components for data upload functionality. No risks are identifiable at this level.",
