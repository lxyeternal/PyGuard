  "purpose": "To provide functionality for uploading pandas DataFrames into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Imports from .db and .uploader modules, as well as the version string",
  "sinks": "Potential database connection code within the imported modules (not shown here), and data processing in DataUploader and Database classes",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from pandas DataFrames to the database via the imported modules; specifics depend on their implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present in this snippet; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code shown",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package with versioning and re-exports of classes Database and DataUploader. It contains only import statements and a package docstring. No code executes input/output, data handling, or network operations directly. Since actual implementation details are within imported modules, no malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred from this file alone. The code appears standard for a data upload package, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues.\n\nWithout inspecting the imported modules (.db and .uploader), the overall risk cannot be fully assessed. However, based solely on this file, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign package definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple interface for data upload functionality, relying on external modules. No sensitive data, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.",
