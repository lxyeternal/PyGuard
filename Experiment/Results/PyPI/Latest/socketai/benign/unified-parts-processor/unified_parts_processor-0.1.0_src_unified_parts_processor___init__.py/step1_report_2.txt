{
  "purpose": "The package is intended to upload pandas DataFrames into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules '.db' and '.uploader', which may contain data handling or database connection logic.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code snippet; potential sinks would be within imported modules when handling database connections or data uploads.",
  "flows": "The flow would involve data being passed from external sources into the 'Database' or 'DataUploader' classes, which are not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal package interface code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code primarily defines package metadata and imports two modules, 'db' and 'uploader', which are likely responsible for core functionality. Since the actual implementations of these modules are not provided, any malicious behavior or security risks would reside within them. The visible code itself is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The package's purpose appears legitimate based on the description. There are no indications of malicious data flow or malicious code in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The actual security assessment depends on the contents of imported modules, which are not visible here.",
