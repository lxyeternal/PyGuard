  "purpose": "Package initializer that imports and exposes core classes for database and data uploading functionalities.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only module imports and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package setup, importing modules and defining exports. No security-sensitive operations, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The actual logic resides in imported modules (.db and .uploader), which are not provided. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores, and minimal security risk. The confidence scores are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident here, the scores are appropriate and consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The overall security posture depends on the imported modules, but this snippet itself is safe. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified and should remain unchanged.",
