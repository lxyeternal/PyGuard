{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to upload pandas DataFrames into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.db' and '.uploader', which likely contain the main logic and database interaction code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'Database' and 'DataUploader' classes, depending on their implementation, especially if they handle untrusted data or execute SQL queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pandas DataFrames through 'DataUploader' into the database via 'Database' class, possibly involving SQL execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be a straightforward package initializer.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a package with a version, imports two local modules, and exposes two classes via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations in this snippet. The code itself does not include any input handling, data processing, or database interaction logic. Since the main functionality is delegated to imported modules (.db and .uploader), the security of the package depends on their implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies in this initial setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initializer with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The overall security posture depends on the implementation of 'Database' and 'DataUploader' classes in the imported modules.",
