{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an interface for a package that uploads pandas DataFrames into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions are present in this snippet. External data sources are likely handled within the imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution commands are directly present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable within this snippet; any data flow would occur inside the imported modules (.db and .uploader).",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, mainly consisting of module imports, version declaration, and exports. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "This code functions as a module initializer, exposing classes Database and DataUploader from internal modules. It includes version info and a list of exported symbols. There are no active data reads, network operations, or code execution shown. Since the actual implementation resides in imported modules, potential malicious activity could exist there, but it is not present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports and exposes classes for database operations. No malicious or suspicious code is evident in this snippet.",
