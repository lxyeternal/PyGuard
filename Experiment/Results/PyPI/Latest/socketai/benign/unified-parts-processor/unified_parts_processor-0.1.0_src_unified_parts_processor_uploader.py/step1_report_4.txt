  "purpose": "Service class to upload device records into the database from a Pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'df' containing device data, accessed via df.iterrows() and columns such as 'device_name', 'price', 'model', 'brand', 'serial_number', 'date', 'brand_code', 'product_number'.",
  "sinks": "Database session's add_all() and commit() methods, which write data into the database.",
  "flows": "DataFrame rows (untrusted input) are converted into Device objects, then added to the database session and committed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No unusual network activity, cryptomining, or data exfiltration detected. The code processes data safely with proper date parsing and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from an external DataFrame, converts each row into a Device object, and commits to the database. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The data handling appears straightforward and safe. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The only potential concern is data validation; however, this is outside the scope of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data upload utility with no malicious behavior or supply chain risks detected. It securely processes data into the database with proper use of SQLAlchemy session. No malware or security risks are evident.",
