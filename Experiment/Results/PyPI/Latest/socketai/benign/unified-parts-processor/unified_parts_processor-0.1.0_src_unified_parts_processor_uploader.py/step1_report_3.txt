  "purpose": "Service class to upload device records into the database from a Pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input in upload_from_dataframe method, reading columns such as 'device_name', 'price', 'model', 'brand', 'serial_number', 'date', 'brand_code', 'product_number'.",
  "sinks": "Database session's add_all() and commit() methods, which insert data into the database.",
  "flows": "DataFrame data flows from the input to the creation of Device objects, then to database insertion via session.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data handling. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed. The code appears standard for data insertion.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with dependencies on pandas and internal modules, then defines a class for uploading data. The upload_from_dataframe method iterates over DataFrame rows, creates Device instances with data from each row, and commits them to the database. No external inputs other than the DataFrame are processed, and no data is sent over networks or stored insecurely. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The code appears to perform a standard data load operation with proper use of ORM methods, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data upload utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations and appears safe.",
