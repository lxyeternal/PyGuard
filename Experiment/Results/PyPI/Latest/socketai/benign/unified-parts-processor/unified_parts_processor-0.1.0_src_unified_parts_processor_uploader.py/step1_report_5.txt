  "purpose": "Service class to upload device records from a Pandas DataFrame into a database.",
  "sources": "DataFrame input in the upload_from_dataframe method, reading columns such as 'device_name', 'price', 'model', etc.",
  "sinks": "Database session commit, which writes data into the database.",
  "flows": "DataFrame data (untrusted input) flows into Device object creation, then into database via session.add_all() and session.commit().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No network activity, no code obfuscation, and no use of insecure functions beyond standard pandas and SQLAlchemy patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from a DataFrame, constructs Device objects, and commits them to a database. All inputs are presumed to be data supplied by users or external sources, but no validation beyond DataFrame schema matching occurs. The code does not perform any insecure SQL operations directly, nor does it handle sensitive credentials within the code. No hidden or malicious logic is evident. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests typical data processing behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data upload implementation with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It processes input data and stores it in a database securely without apparent vulnerabilities.",
