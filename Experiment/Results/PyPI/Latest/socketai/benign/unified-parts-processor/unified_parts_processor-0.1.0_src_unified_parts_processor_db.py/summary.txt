  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure singleton ORM handler with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The operational risk associated with drop_all() is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate; the risk score could be slightly increased to reflect potential operational hazards but remains low. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
