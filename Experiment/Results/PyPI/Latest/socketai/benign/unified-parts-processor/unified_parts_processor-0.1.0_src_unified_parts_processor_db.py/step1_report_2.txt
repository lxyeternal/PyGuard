{
  "purpose": "Provides a singleton class for managing PostgreSQL database connections using SQLAlchemy, allowing session creation and table management.",
  "sources": "The db_uri parameter provided during Database class instantiation; SQLAlchemy create_engine call.",
  "sinks": "The database engine created by create_engine, and session objects returned by get_session().",
  "flows": "Input: db_uri → create_engine; session creation via sessionmaker → database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears standard for database connection handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton Database class that manages database connections using SQLAlchemy. It accepts a database URI as input, which is used to create an engine. The get_session method provides ORM sessions for database operations. The create_tables method manages table creation, with an option to drop existing tables. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure and functions are typical for database handling and do not include any indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a database connection handler with singleton pattern and ORM table management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for use, assuming the provided db_uri is secure and trusted.",
