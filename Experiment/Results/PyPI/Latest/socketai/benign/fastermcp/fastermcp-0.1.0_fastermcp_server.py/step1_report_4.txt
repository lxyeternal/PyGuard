{
  "purpose": "Server module for handling MCP (presumably a protocol) requests in a FastAPI application, including registration and execution of tools and resources.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST request handlers that accept JSON payloads for /tools, /resources, /context, and /execute endpoints; data reading from incoming request bodies.",
  "sinks": "Execution of tool functions via 'await tool.func(**request.parameters)', potential exceptions, and responses returning results or error messages.",
  "flows": "Incoming JSON data (sources) processed in route handlers, validated, then passed to protocol methods and tool functions; results sent back as responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic function invocation with 'hasattr' and 'await' appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected. No external network calls or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a FastAPI-based server class that registers tools, resources, creates contexts, and executes tools. Input data is received via POST requests, validated, and processed accordingly. Tool execution involves calling asynchronous functions stored in tool objects, with error handling in place. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors identified. All operations seem aligned with typical server request handling. The code relies on external MCPProtocol and other classes for core logic, but no malicious or malicious-sounding code patterns are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward server implementation for managing and executing tools via HTTP API. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this code segment. The logic is consistent with standard practices; no suspicious patterns detected.",
