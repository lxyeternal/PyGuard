{
  "purpose": "This server module handles MCP requests, including tool registration, resource registration, context creation, and tool execution for the FasterMCP system.",
  "sources": "User input data from API requests to /tools, /resources, /context, /execute endpoints; data from MCPProtocol methods; incoming JSON payloads.",
  "sinks": "Execution of tool functions via 'tool.func'; raising HTTPExceptions with detailed messages; returning JSON responses with potentially sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API request payloads to protocol methods and tool functions; parameters are validated and passed to functions; results are returned or errors raised based on function outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code utilizes standard FastAPI patterns. No obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server interface for managing tools, resources, and contexts. It relies on external 'MCPProtocol' and 'Tool' classes, which are assumed to be secure. Endpoints handle data inputs and invoke protocol methods or tool functions. Input validation is basic but adequate. No data leakage, insecure practices, or malicious behavior detected. Potential concern is the execution of 'tool.func', but this is expected functionality assuming trusted tools. No suspicious network activity or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard FastAPI server module for managing MCP workflows. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified. It relies on external classes which are not examined here, but within this code, there are no malicious patterns.",
