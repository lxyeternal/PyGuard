  "conclusion": "The code itself is structurally sound and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The main security concern is the potential execution of malicious code via 'tool.func' if a malicious tool is registered. This risk is external and depends on trust in registered tools. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the potential danger of executing untrusted code. To mitigate this, sandboxing or validation of 'tool.func' implementations is recommended. Overall, the code is safe in its current form but should be used with caution regarding external tool trustworthiness."
