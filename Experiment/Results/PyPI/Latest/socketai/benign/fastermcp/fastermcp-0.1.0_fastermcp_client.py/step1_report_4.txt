  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with an MCP server to register tools/resources, create contexts, and execute tools.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST requests to server URLs with JSON data, reading server responses via response.json().",
  "sinks": "Returning server responses directly, potentially untrusted data flow; no data leaks but responses are passed through without validation.",
  "flows": "Client methods send JSON data to server endpoints; responses are parsed and returned, passing untrusted data directly from server to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious code structures, no obfuscation. No malicious behaviors or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an API client for server interactions, using asynchronous HTTP requests. Inputs include user-supplied prompts, tool/resource data, and parameters, which are sent via POST requests. Responses are parsed and returned directly. No handling of sensitive data like credentials; no suspicious external connections or code execution observed. The structure and usage are typical for API clients. No anomalies or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client for server interactions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages the HTTP session lifecycle. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected.",
