  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with the MCP server, providing functions to register tools/resources, create contexts, and execute tools via asynchronous HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as server_url, tool, resource, prompt, tool_names, resource_ids, tool_name, parameters; data sent via HTTP POST requests as JSON payloads.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to server endpoints; response JSON parsing; no direct untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are serialized into JSON and sent over network requests; responses are received and parsed into Python objects or dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard async HTTP client practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured asynchronous API client using aiohttp and pydantic. It manages session lifecycle correctly, performs expected operations without hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Data flows are typical for such clients, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted data over network, which is inherent to API clients. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this module is solid.",
