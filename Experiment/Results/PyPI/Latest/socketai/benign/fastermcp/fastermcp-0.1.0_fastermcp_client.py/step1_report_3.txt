{
  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with the FasterMCP server, including registration of tools/resources, context creation, and tool execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as server_url, Tool, Resource, Context, prompt, tool_names, resource_ids, tool_name, parameters",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to server endpoints with JSON payloads; server responses parsed as JSON",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to construct JSON request payloads; these payloads are sent via POST requests; server responses are received and processed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation; code primarily handles standard HTTP request/response logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines an asynchronous client class for a server API, handling registration, context creation, and execution via HTTP POST requests. It uses standard libraries (aiohttp, pydantic) without any suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Input validation is minimal, but appropriate for a client module. The code structure is typical for an API client and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The JSON payloads are straightforward, with no evident injection vectors or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly manages HTTP sessions and performs expected actions for server interaction. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
