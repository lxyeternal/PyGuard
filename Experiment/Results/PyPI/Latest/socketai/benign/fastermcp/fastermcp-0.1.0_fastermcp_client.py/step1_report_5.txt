{
  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with the MCP server, providing methods to register tools, resources, create contexts, and execute tools asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Inputs include 'server_url' during initialization, method parameters such as 'tool', 'resource', 'prompt', 'tool_names', 'resource_ids', 'tool_name', and 'parameters'. Data is read from method arguments and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into JSON payloads sent via HTTP POST requests in methods: register_tool, register_resource, create_context, execute_tool.",
  "flows": "Data from method parameters and class attributes flow into JSON request bodies, which are sent over HTTP POST requests to server endpoints; responses are parsed as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. Usage of standard libraries (aiohttp, pydantic) and typical async context management. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous HTTP client for MCP server interactions. It properly manages session lifecycle with async context managers, constructs JSON payloads from method arguments, and processes server responses. No hardcoded secrets, no insecure handling of input data, and no suspicious network activities or backdoors detected. The code appears to serve its intended purpose securely and without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard client implementation for MCP server interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It functions as expected without introducing vulnerabilities.",
