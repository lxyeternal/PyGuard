{
  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with an MCP server, handling tool registration, resource registration, context creation, and tool execution.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters such as 'tool', 'resource', 'prompt', 'tool_names', 'resource_ids', 'parameters', and the server_url for requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to server endpoints ('/tools', '/resources', '/context', '/execute') with JSON payloads containing potentially untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into JSON request bodies sent via aiohttp POST requests; responses are parsed as JSON and returned or used to instantiate objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard client-server communication without any suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, and no suspicious URLs are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The module provides an asynchronous client class for MCP server interactions, with methods for registering tools/resources, creating contexts, and executing tools. Each method constructs JSON payloads from method parameters, which are then sent via HTTP POST. There is proper use of session management with context managers. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling are present. The server URL is parameterized, reducing risk of embedded malicious URLs. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API interaction without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard API client for MCP server interaction with no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or backdoors. It performs expected data handling for network communication. No security issues or malware are detected based on the provided code.",
