{
  "purpose": "Client module for interacting with the MCP server, providing functions to register tools and resources, create contexts, and execute tools via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include parameters such as 'tool', 'resource', 'prompt', 'tool_names', 'resource_ids', 'parameters', and 'tool_name' provided to various methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to server endpoints ('/tools', '/resources', '/context', '/execute') which transmit JSON data containing user-supplied inputs.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into request data structures (e.g., 'prompt', 'tool_names', 'parameters') which are then serialized into JSON and sent via HTTP POST to server endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. Use of async context management is standard; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous HTTP client for interacting with a server, with functions to register tools/resources, create contexts, and execute tools. Data is passed via JSON payloads. No evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. All data sources are parameters provided during method calls, and sinks are HTTP requests. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual data flows. Security appears to rely on the server-side validation and secure communication channels. The overall design is standard for an API client, with proper session management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured client interface for server interaction. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or obfuscated code. No indications of malware or security risks are apparent from this review.",
