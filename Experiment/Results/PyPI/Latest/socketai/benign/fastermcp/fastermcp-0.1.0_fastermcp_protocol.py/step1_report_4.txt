{
  "purpose": "The code defines a core protocol module for MCP communication, allowing registration of tools and resources, and creation of interaction contexts for an LLM-based system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function parameters, class attributes, and external method calls such as inspect.getdoc and get_type_hints.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the registration methods (register_tool, register_resource) and context creation (create_context), which handle data that could include malicious or malformed inputs if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-defined functions and external inputs into tool registration (via decorators), resource registration, and context creation, with no evident dangerous data handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The use of inspect and dynamic type hints appears standard. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The module provides a framework for defining tools, resources, and contexts for an LLM protocol. It uses decorators to convert functions into tools, capturing their metadata without executing arbitrary code dynamically. Resource and tool registration are straightforward. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard Python introspection and data management, with no external or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a protocol handler for LLM interactions, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It manages user-defined tools and resources securely and transparently. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
