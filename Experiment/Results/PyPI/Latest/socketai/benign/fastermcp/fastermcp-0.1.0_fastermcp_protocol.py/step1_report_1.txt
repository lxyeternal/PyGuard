{
  "purpose": "This code defines a core protocol module for managing tools, resources, and interaction contexts for an LLM-based system, specifically within the FasterMCP framework.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function annotations, docstrings, and parameters during the registration of tools via the 'tool' decorator; resource and tool registration methods read from provided resource and tool objects; context creation reads from stored tools and resources based on provided IDs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks are present; the code mainly handles data structures and registrations without executing or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Tools are registered from functions via the decorator, which collects metadata; resources and tools are stored internally; contexts are created by referencing stored tools and resources based on names/IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments; the code performs standard registration and wrapping of functions; no obfuscated or unusual language features are used; no dynamic code execution or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to register tools and resources, and to create context objects for interactions. The 'tool' decorator captures function metadata and creates Tool objects, which are stored in a dictionary. The registration and creation methods are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard framework setup for managing LLM tools and resources, with no external communication or unsafe operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious framework for registering tools and resources, and creating interaction contexts. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use within a larger LLM-based application.",
