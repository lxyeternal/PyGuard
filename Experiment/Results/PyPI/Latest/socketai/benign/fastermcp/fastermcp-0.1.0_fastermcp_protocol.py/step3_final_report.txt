  "purpose": "Framework for registering tools and resources, creating contexts, and extracting metadata via decorators in an LLM environment.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, docstrings, and annotations used to generate tool schemas; internal data structures for tools, resources, and contexts.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or code execution; data flows are internal within the framework.",
  "flows": "Decorators capture function metadata (source) and register tools; context creation pulls tools/resources by name or ID (source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of `inspect` and `get_type_hints` for dynamic schema creation, which could be exploited if malicious functions are registered, but no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and a core protocol class for managing tools, resources, and contexts. The `tool` decorator captures function metadata and registers tools based on signatures and docstrings. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is detected. The dynamic schema generation via introspection is standard but could be misused if untrusted functions are registered. Overall, the code is straightforward, safe, and designed for plugin management within an LLM framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured plugin framework with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential concern is misuse of dynamic schema features if malicious functions are registered, but within the current scope, it remains safe.",
