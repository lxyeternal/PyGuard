{
  "purpose": "Defines core protocol classes and decorators for registering tools and resources in an MCP-based LLM interaction framework.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, class attributes, inspect.getdoc, get_type_hints, and signature for dynamic schema creation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; potential misuse of dynamic code metadata for malicious purposes is unlikely but possible if external inputs influence annotations or function metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A; mostly static registration and context creation without executing untrusted code or handling untrusted input data in a manner that could lead to exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code relies on inspection and dynamic schema generation, which could be misused if function definitions are maliciously crafted, but this alone isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for registering tools and resources, creating contexts, and converting functions into tools with metadata. It uses inspection and type hints for schema creation, but there are no execution of untrusted code, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious code are evident. The usage is standard for an API or plugin system. The dynamic creation of schemas based on annotations could be manipulated in a malicious package, but that alone isn't malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be standard, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward framework for registering tools and resources in an MCP system, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, network exploits, or data theft mechanisms. It seems safe with a low malware risk score.",
