  "purpose": "Define core protocol classes and decorators for managing tools, resources, and communication context within the FasterMCP framework.",
  "sources": "User input via function decorators, class instantiations, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. The code primarily registers and constructs data schemas.",
  "flows": "Decorator creates Tool objects from function metadata; register methods store tools and resources; create_context assembles context from registered entities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of inspect and get_type_hints for dynamic schema creation is standard for decorator-based frameworks. No code injection or unsafe execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Tool, Resource, and Context, and a class MCPProtocol for managing them. The 'tool' decorator converts functions into Tool objects, capturing metadata and parameters, and registers them. Methods for resource registration and context creation are straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The dynamic schema generation is common in such frameworks and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to implement a standard plugin-like architecture for a language model control protocol.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard framework component for managing tools and resources, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs registration and metadata extraction without executing untrusted code or external communications. The design appears intentional for its purpose and does not contain harmful code.",
