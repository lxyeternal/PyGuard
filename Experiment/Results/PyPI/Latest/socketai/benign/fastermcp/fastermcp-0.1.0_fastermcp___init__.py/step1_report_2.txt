{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that provides imports and metadata for a library called FasterMCP, designed for building MCP servers and clients.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules: fastermcp.server, fastermcp.client, and fastermcp.protocol.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports classes and functions, establishing an interface but not executing data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a straightforward library initializer, importing components and defining metadata. There are no input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations present. The lack of dynamic code execution or external data handling reduces risk. The module appears to be purely structural, intended for use as part of a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple library interface with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a foundation for MCP server and client implementations without any suspicious or harmful code present.",
