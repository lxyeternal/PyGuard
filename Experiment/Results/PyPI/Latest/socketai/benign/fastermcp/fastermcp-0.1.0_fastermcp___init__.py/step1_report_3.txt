  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for a library called FasterMCP, which appears to facilitate building MCP servers and clients.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'fastermcp' package modules: server, client, protocol, and associated classes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports classes and assigns a version string and exports the symbols, with no data flow beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for a library with a version and exports. It imports core components necessary for building MCP servers and clients, with no data processing or external data input. No malicious or suspicious actions are visible. The code appears to be a standard library entry point or public interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an interface definition and does not contain harmful or suspicious logic.",
