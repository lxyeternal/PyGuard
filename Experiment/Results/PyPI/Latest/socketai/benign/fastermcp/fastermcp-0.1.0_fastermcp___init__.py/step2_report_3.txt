  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initializer (__init__.py style), importing classes and defining __version__ and __all__.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is simple and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **No flaws identified.** The reports correctly interpret the code as a benign module initializer with no security concerns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is just an interface initializer, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about hidden behaviors or malicious payloads are made, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard package __init__.py file, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- The uniformity across reports suggests no overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
