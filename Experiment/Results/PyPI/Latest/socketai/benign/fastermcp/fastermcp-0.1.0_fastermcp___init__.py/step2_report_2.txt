  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the associated reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module, likely an `__init__.py`, that:\n- Defines a version string.\n- Imports core classes (`MCPServer`, `MCPClient`, `MCPProtocol`, `Tool`, `Resource`, `Context`) from internal modules.\n- Exposes these classes via the `__all__` list.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely structural, involving only imports and exports.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs here.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, network communication, or data manipulation that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Flaws:**\n   - Given its role as an initialization or interface module, it appears benign.\n   - The lack of data handling, input validation, or external interactions reduces the attack surface.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n4. **Review of Reported Scores:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - These are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module initializer for a Python library.\n- No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- I agree with the current scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security Risk:** 0\n\n- The overall assessment is that this code is safe and does not pose any security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
