{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization or entry point for the FasterMCP library, exposing key classes for building MCP servers and clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fastermcp' modules and the assignment of __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential classes and functions from internal modules, assigns version info, and defines the public API via __all__. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The structure is typical for a Python package's initialization file, with no complex logic or dynamic execution. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for the FasterMCP library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes certain classes for external use.",
