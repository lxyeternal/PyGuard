  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python library for building MCP servers and clients, providing imports and exposing core components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fastermcp.server', 'fastermcp.client', and 'fastermcp.protocol' modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no handling of untrusted data, user input, or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Imports load modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines the module's version, and explicitly exports classes related to MCP server and client functionality. All operations are straightforward and involve only importing and exposing components. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations in this snippet that could lead to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module initializer and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign and standard setup for a library package.",
