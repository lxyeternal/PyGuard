  "purpose": "To provide an entry point and export important classes for the 'fastermcp' library, facilitating use of MCP server and client functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fastermcp.server', 'fastermcp.client', and 'fastermcp.protocol'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components from the 'fastermcp' package and defines versioning and export variables. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. It functions as an initial module setup for the package without involving user input or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module initializer that only imports and exports package components without any malicious intent or security risks.",
