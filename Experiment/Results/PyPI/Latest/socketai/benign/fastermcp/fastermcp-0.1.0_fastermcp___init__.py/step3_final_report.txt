{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization module for the FasterMCP library, exposing core classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: 'fastermcp.server', 'fastermcp.client', 'fastermcp.protocol'; definition of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, network connections, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports and definitions are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module initializer that imports classes and functions, defines version info, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and structural nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard library entry point with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scoring aligns with its straightforward structure.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
