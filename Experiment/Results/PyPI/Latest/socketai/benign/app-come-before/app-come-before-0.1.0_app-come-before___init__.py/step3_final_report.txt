{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The script reads input data from variables or files, typical for data processing tasks.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to files, console, or network, but no untrusted data flows indicating malicious intent are evident.",
  "flows": "Input sources flow into processing functions and then to outputs; no suspicious or malicious source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network communication. Confidence is moderate (0.7), given limited context. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal but acknowledged uncertainty due to limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious indicators. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
