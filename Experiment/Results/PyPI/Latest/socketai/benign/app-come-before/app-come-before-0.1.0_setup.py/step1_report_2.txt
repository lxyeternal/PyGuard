{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'app-come-before' including dependencies and entry point.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; setup script primarily defines package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; comments indicate possible extensibility but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and command-line entry points. No untrusted input, no network activity, no suspicious code structures. The only potential concern could be the 'server.app:main' entry point, which depends on external code, but nothing malicious is evident here. No obfuscation, no unusual code patterns, and no hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply configures a Python package and an entry point, with no suspicious code or behavior.",
