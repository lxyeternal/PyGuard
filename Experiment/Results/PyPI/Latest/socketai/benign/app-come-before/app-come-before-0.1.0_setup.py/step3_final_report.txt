  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry point for application execution.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input; static code defining package info and entry point.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'server.app:main' when invoked, which is application logic, not malicious code.",
  "flows": "The setup process itself does not process untrusted data; the entry point may invoke application code, but no data flows are evident in this script.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools, specifying package name, version, dependencies, and an entry point. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The entry point 'server.app:main' is a standard pattern for launching application logic, not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2) due to potential execution of application code, which is typical in such scripts. All reports correctly assess the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score reflects the potential for executing application code via the entry point, but this is normal and not malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. Overall, the supply chain component appears safe and legitimate.",
