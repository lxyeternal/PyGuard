{
  "purpose": "This code manages AI agent lifecycle via a FastMCP server, providing endpoints for listing models/tools, creating, checking status, and terminating agents.",
  "sources": "load_catalog() calls for models and tools, get_session() for database sessions, external launch_agent() and cleanup_task methods, and get_agent_by_id() for agent retrieval.",
  "sinks": "launch_agent() potentially initiates external containers; cleanup_task._kill_container() terminates containers; database functions update agent states; URL construction for streaming.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (model_id, tools, etc.) are validated against catalog; agent creation involves database entry and container launch; status retrieval reads from database; termination triggers container kill and state update.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated load_catalog() calls could be optimized; use of private method _kill_container() may indicate API design concern but not security risk; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, resource management, and external calls for agent orchestration. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. External modules are assumed secure. The repeated catalog loading is inefficient but not a security concern. Use of a private method for container termination should be reviewed but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured agent management server with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and appropriate.",
