{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a FastMCP server for managing agents, including listing models and tools, creating agents, checking status, and terminating agents.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include parameters for create_agent (model_id, tools, prompt, context, ttl_seconds, stream), agent_id for get_agent_status and terminate_agent, and catalog loading functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raise statements, external function calls (launch_agent, database operations), and the construction of URLs and responses, which could leak or execute malicious data if inputs are compromised.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (model_id, tools, agent_id) flows into validation and database functions, and potentially into external launch and cleanup functions; data from database and catalog flows into response structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. Use of load_catalog() multiple times may be inefficient but not malicious. No evident data leaks or malicious code injections. No suspicious network or system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical server setup, data validation, and resource management for an agent system. Validation steps prevent injection or misuse. External calls are to trusted components. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual logic are present. The repeated catalog loading could be optimized but does not pose a security risk. Overall, the code follows expected patterns for a service of this nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of an agent management server with proper validation and resource handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this module. It operates within typical expectations for such a service.",
