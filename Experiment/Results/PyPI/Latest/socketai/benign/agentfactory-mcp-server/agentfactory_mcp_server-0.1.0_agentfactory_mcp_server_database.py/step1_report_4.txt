{
  "purpose": "Provides database models and utilities for managing agent metadata and lifecycle in a SQLite database.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters for functions (e.g., agent_id, tools, state, exit_code), database queries (select statements), and internal method calls (datetime.now, uuid.uuid4).",
  "sinks": "Database write operations (session.add, session.commit, session.refresh) and property methods. No data leaks or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Functions -> Database queries or updates -> Database storage or retrieval; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code appears standard for ORM-based database management with no obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLModel-based data structure for agent metadata, including methods to create, retrieve, and update records within a SQLite database. It employs safe session management and proper timestamp handling. No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions handle typical CRUD operations without any signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior. All operations are confined within local database interactions and standard Python library usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard database utility module for managing agent metadata, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper session handling and no suspicious patterns.",
