{
  "purpose": "The code provides database models and utility functions for managing agent metadata, including creation, retrieval, and updating agent states within a SQLite database.",
  "sources": "Reads include environment configuration (DATABASE_URL), datetime functions, and UUID generation for ID creation. Also reads from database sessions to fetch or modify agent records.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the database via session.add() and session.commit(); no untrusted data is directly written to sensitive sinks such as network or system files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments (e.g., agent_id, tools, state) into database objects and queries. For example, create_agent uses current datetime and TTL to generate an AgentMeta instance, which is then stored in the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual or hidden logic detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for a database utility layer.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLModel-based ORM structure for agent metadata, with functions to create, retrieve, and update records. It uses standard libraries like uuid and datetime for ID and timestamp management. The session management uses context managers to ensure proper transaction handling. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code operates solely on database interactions with well-defined functions and no external network calls or file manipulations outside the database. All data handling seems safe, with no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or security misconfiguration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate database utility module for managing agent metadata, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard CRUD operations and ID generation without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
