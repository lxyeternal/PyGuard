  "purpose": "Define database models and utilities for managing agent metadata, including creation, retrieval, and updating of agent records.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, Pydantic and SQLModel classes, database connection setup, and utility functions for database operations.",
  "sinks": "Database session commits and refreshes, data serialization, and ID generation.",
  "flows": "Input data (agent_id, tools, state, exit_code) flows through create/update functions, ultimately being written into the database via session commits.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or file operations are present. The code uses standard patterns for database management and ID generation. No unusual or potentially malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages agent metadata via SQLModel and SQLAlchemy, including functions for creating, retrieving, and updating records. It uses UUIDs for IDs, datetime for timestamps, and safe session management. No external network calls, command executions, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The functions perform standard data handling tasks securely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of database models and utilities for managing agent information. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
