{
  "purpose": "The code provides database models and utility functions for managing agent metadata, including creation, retrieval, and updating agent states in a SQLite database.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, database queries, and system time (datetime).",
  "sinks": "Database write operations (session.add, session.commit), object creation, and property evaluations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., agent_id, tools, state) flow into database queries and object methods; system time influences timestamp fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code appears standard for ORM usage. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes database models for agent metadata, including unique ID generation, status management, and persistence through SQLModel and SQLAlchemy. Utility functions handle database session management, creation, and updates. The use of UUIDs and timestamps appears standard. No data leakage, credential handling, or malicious logic detected. The code lacks any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration features. Overall, the code is straightforward, primarily data handling with ORM operations, and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM-based database utility for managing agent metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
