  "purpose": "Define database models and utilities for managing agent metadata, including creation, retrieval, and updating of agent records.",
  "sources": "Database connection string, UUID generation, datetime functions, and input parameters to functions (agent_id, model_id, tools, state, exit_code).",
  "sinks": "Database session commits, data serialization with JSON, and UUID/ID creation functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (agent_id, state, etc.) flow into database update functions; data is retrieved from and stored into the database; creation functions generate IDs and timestamps; data is committed to the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets. Usage of external libraries (sqlmodel, sqlalchemy, pydantic) appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard ORM models and database utilities for managing agent metadata. It uses UUIDs for IDs, timestamps for tracking creation and expiration, and typical database operations with SQLModel and SQLAlchemy. No signs of malicious code, such as secret exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The functions operate on local database connections, and there are no external network calls or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of database models and management utilities for agent metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code's design aligns with standard practices for data persistence in Python applications.",
