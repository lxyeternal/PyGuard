  "purpose": "Load and validate a catalog file containing models and tools for an agent system.",
  "sources": "Reads 'catalog.json' file from filesystem, loads JSON data from the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause security issues; no external data or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reads file path -> loads JSON data -> validates data against models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries, proper validation, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads a JSON file, validates its structure and uniqueness constraints using Pydantic models, and caches the loaded catalog. No external network access, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only external input is the file read from disk, which is validated against expected schemas. The validation includes ensuring unique model IDs and presence of at least one model and tool. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward catalog loader with proper validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
