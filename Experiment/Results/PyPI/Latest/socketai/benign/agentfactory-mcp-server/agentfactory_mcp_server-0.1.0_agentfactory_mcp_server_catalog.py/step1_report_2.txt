  "purpose": "Load and validate a catalog configuration file containing models and tools information.",
  "sources": "File input via open() function reading 'catalog.json' or a provided file path; json.load() reading the file content.",
  "sinks": "The json.load() function reads untrusted file data; Catalog.model_validate() processes this data.",
  "flows": "File content -> json.load() -> data -> Catalog.model_validate() -> validated catalog object",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of standard libraries and straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a JSON file specified by a path or defaults to 'catalog.json'. It reads the file content, parses JSON, and validates the schema via Pydantic. The validation includes checks for unique model IDs and presence of models and tools, with no untrusted input execution or network activity. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The function is memoized with lru_cache, which is standard for caching.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign file loading and validation process with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code. It relies on standard Python libraries and Pydantic for validation. No security risks or malware behaviors detected.",
