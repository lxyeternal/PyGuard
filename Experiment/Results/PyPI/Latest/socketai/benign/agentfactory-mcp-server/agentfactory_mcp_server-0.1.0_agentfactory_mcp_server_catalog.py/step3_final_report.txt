  "purpose": "Load and validate a JSON catalog file containing models and tools, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness constraints.",
  "sources": "Reading the catalog.json file from disk, loading JSON data, and passing it to Pydantic for validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is validated after loading, with no external system interactions.",
  "flows": "File read -> JSON load -> Data validation -> Return Catalog object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, JSON parsing, and schema validation using Pydantic. It enforces constraints such as unique model IDs and presence of models and tools. Uses lru_cache for caching, which is benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external command invocation. The validation process mitigates risks from malformed or malicious JSON data. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to trusting local files, which are validated. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is present. The risk score is low (~0.1), justified by the minimal threat from local file handling with validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with proper validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
