  "purpose": "Define Pydantic schemas for API request and response payloads related to agent creation and status.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from API inputs, such as model_id, tools, agent_name, prompt, context, ttl_seconds, and stream. It also loads a catalog via load_catalog().",
  "sinks": "The code uses load_catalog() to validate model_id and tools, but does not directly execute or write untrusted data to external systems or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through Pydantic validation, including model and tool validation via load_catalog(). Validated data is used internally; no further external flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The validation logic appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data schemas with validation for creating agents and reporting agent status. It loads a catalog for validation purposes, which could pose a security concern if load_catalog() is compromised, but the schema code itself does not perform external or dangerous operations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is present. The validation ensures proper referencing of models and tools from the catalog. The structure and logic are straightforward and follow standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard schema definitions with validation logic, primarily relying on load_catalog() for validation checks. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code fragment. The risk is minimal, assuming load_catalog() is secure and trustworthy.",
