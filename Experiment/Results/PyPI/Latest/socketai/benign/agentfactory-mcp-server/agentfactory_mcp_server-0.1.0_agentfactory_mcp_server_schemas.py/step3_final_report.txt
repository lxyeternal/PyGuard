  "purpose": "Define Pydantic schemas for API agent creation and status reporting with validation against an external catalog.",
  "sources": "load_catalog() called within model_validator to verify model_id and tools against catalog data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; validation only references catalog data, no data exfiltration or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (model_id, tools) -> load_catalog() -> validation checks -> schema validation output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external load_catalog() during validation could impact performance but not security; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining schemas with validation that cross-references an external catalog. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The external catalog loading during validation is standard but could introduce performance issues. No network activity or code injection is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by reliance on external data but not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on load_catalog() is a typical pattern, with minimal security concern assuming the catalog source is trustworthy. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
