  "purpose": "Define Pydantic schemas for API request and response payloads related to agent creation and status reporting.",
  "sources": "Import statements, load_catalog() function, model validators, field validators, and data fields.",
  "sinks": "load_catalog() usage (potential data access), validation functions (potentially throwing exceptions). No direct data sinks like network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (API payload) flows through validators and model validation, which access external catalog data, then outputs validated model instances or raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of load_catalog() within model_validator raises concern about external data access during model validation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Validation is straightforward; no data leaks or code injection evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models with validation logic. The load_catalog() function is called during model validation to verify model IDs and tools against a catalog. This external call could be a source of runtime delay or dependency issues but does not constitute malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is detected. The use of validation ensures data integrity but does not introduce security risks. The code does not contain any obfuscated or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data validation schemas using Pydantic, with external catalog validation during model validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The use of load_catalog() in validation is normal but could be a performance consideration.",
