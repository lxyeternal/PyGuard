  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides error handling middleware for FastAPI, standardizing error responses. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, implementing exception handlers that convert exceptions into JSON responses with error codes. Uses standard logging, no obfuscation, no external calls, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues found. The high confidence and zero scores for malware/security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard error handling, logging, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard FastAPI exception handling, with no signs of malicious activity. The report notes no obfuscation, external calls, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) perhaps due to the general nature of error handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard error handling middleware, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code handles exceptions, logs errors, returns structured JSON responses. No obfuscation, external network activity, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard error handling, potential for error info leakage but currently controlled.\n- **Assessment:** The code logs errors and returns error responses with controlled error details. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) possibly due to concern about error detail exposure, but the code appears safe. The score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard error handling, no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Same as previous, well-structured, safe error management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is standard FastAPI error handling middleware, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minimal risk associated with error handling code that does not perform external calls, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, as the code is simple, well-understood, and no suspicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor risk associated with error detail exposure, but mitigated by controlled responses and logging.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No further adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential info leakage, but minimal and well-controlled)\n\nThis code is a safe, standard implementation of error handling middleware for FastAPI, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
