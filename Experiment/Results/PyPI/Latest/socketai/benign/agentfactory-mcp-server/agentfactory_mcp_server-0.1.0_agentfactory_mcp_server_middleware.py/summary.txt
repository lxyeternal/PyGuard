  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of error handling middleware for FastAPI, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by the minimal potential for information leakage through error details, which is managed appropriately. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose security concerns."
