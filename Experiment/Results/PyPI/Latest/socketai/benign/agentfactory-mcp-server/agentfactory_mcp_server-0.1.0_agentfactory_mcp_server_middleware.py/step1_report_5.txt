{
  "purpose": "This code sets up middleware for error handling and request processing in a FastAPI application, providing standardized error responses for various exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reads exception objects and request data during error handling.",
  "sinks": "Returns JSONResponse objects containing error details; logs error information.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> specific exception handler invoked -> ErrorResponse created -> JSONResponse returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; standard error handling logic. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or unsafe behavior. No network activity or cryptomining observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception handlers for common errors like validation errors, ValueError, HTTP exceptions, and general exceptions. It logs error details and returns structured JSON responses with error codes and messages. All data handling appears to be confined within local variables; no external data or untrusted sources are accessed in a malicious manner. Usage of logging is standard, and error responses are consistent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious code patterns, and no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling middleware setup for FastAPI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly manages exceptions and logs errors without exposing sensitive data or executing unsafe actions.",
