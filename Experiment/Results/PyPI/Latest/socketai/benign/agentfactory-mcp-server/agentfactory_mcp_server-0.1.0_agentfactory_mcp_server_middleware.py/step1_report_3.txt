{
  "purpose": "Provide middleware for error handling and request processing in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (json, logging), FastAPI modules, and pydantic, then defines error handler functions and the ErrorResponse class.",
  "sinks": "ErrorResponse.to_response() creates JSONResponse objects; exception handlers return these responses with error details.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are caught in handlers, logged, and converted into structured JSON responses; no untrusted data is passed directly to sinks without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard error handling for FastAPI, catching various validation and HTTP exceptions, logging warnings or errors, and returning structured JSON error responses. It uses common practices without dynamic code execution or malicious patterns. No external network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be straightforward middleware with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard middleware for error handling in a FastAPI app with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The implementation is typical and safe.",
