{
  "purpose": "Provides error handling middleware for a FastAPI application, standardizing error responses.",
  "sources": "Reads from incoming HTTP requests (implicitly through exception handling) and error details generated during request processing.",
  "sinks": "Returns JSONResponse objects with error details to clients; logs errors via the logger.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught during request processing are mapped to ErrorResponse objects, which generate JSON responses sent back to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. Uses standard FastAPI exception handling with no obfuscated or malicious code. No data leakage or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured error handlers for various FastAPI exceptions, converting them into consistent JSON responses with error codes. It uses standard logging for warnings and exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, focused on error management. No suspicious code flows, obfuscation, or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard middleware for error handling in FastAPI with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, well-structured, and intended solely for error management.",
