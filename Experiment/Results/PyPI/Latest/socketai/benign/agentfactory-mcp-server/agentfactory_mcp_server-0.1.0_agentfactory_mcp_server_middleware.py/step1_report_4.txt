{
  "purpose": "The code provides middleware for error handling and request processing in a FastAPI application, ensuring standardized error responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from incoming HTTP requests via FastAPI request handlers and exception handlers.",
  "sinks": "Potential output points are the JSONResponse objects returned to clients, which could leak detailed error info if misused, but currently only contain controlled error messages.",
  "flows": "Error occurs during request validation or runtime exceptions; handlers capture these errors and generate standardized JSON error responses sent back to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Error handling is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Use of detailed exception information is controlled and logged.",
  "analysis": "The code uses typical FastAPI exception handlers to catch validation errors, value errors, HTTP exceptions, and general exceptions, then returns structured JSON responses with predefined error codes. Logging is employed for warnings and exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious data flows. Error details are not exposed excessively to clients, reducing risk of information leakage. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard error handling middleware for FastAPI with no malicious intent or malicious code present. It securely manages exceptions and logs errors appropriately, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
