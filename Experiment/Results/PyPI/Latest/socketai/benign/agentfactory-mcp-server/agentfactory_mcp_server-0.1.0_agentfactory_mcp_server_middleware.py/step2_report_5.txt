  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is purely error handling middleware; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The logic is straightforward, and the code aligns with standard FastAPI practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The high confidence (1) seems justified.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The error handling is standard and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is standard error handling middleware.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The low risk score seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; the slight risk score accounts for potential misconfigurations or misuses, but none are evident here.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is straightforward error handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The risk score aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code remains standard error handling middleware.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher risk score, possibly reflecting cautious approach to potential information leakage.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; the risk score is conservative but justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard error handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, reflecting conservative security posture but no actual risks.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard error handling middleware)\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious given the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
