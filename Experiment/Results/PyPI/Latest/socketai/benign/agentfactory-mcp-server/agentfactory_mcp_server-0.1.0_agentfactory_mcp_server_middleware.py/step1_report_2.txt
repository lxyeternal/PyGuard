{
  "purpose": "This code defines error handling middleware for a FastAPI application, providing standardized error responses for various exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads request data during validation errors; it logs exceptions and details from caught errors.",
  "sinks": "The code generates JSON responses with error details; it does not write to files, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Sources such as validation errors or exceptions flow into exception handlers, which produce JSON responses with error codes and details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution present. All exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard FastAPI error handlers for validation, HTTP, and general exceptions. It logs errors and returns structured JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or obfuscated parts. The code adheres to typical error handling patterns, and all operations are related to error response management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling middleware for FastAPI with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It improves error responses uniformly and securely manages exceptions without apparent security risks.",
