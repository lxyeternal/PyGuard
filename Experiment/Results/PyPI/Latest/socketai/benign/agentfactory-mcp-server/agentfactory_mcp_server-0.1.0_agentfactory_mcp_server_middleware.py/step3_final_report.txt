  "purpose": "Provides error handling middleware for FastAPI, standardizing error responses and logging.",
  "sources": "Exception handlers for RequestValidationError, ValidationError, ValueError, HTTPException, and general Exception; logs errors and reads exception details.",
  "sinks": "Returns JSONResponse objects with error codes and details; logs errors to standard logger.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are caught by handlers, logged, and converted into structured JSON responses with specific error codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, external network calls, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard FastAPI exception handlers, converting various exceptions into structured JSON error responses. It logs errors appropriately and handles multiple exception types, including validation errors, HTTP errors, and general exceptions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external calls, or obfuscation are present. The error responses are controlled, and no sensitive data is exposed. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for error handling middleware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of error handling middleware for FastAPI, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by the minimal potential for information leakage through error details, which is managed appropriately. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose security concerns.",
