{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module or script defining the version of an agent or server component named 'AgentFactory-MCP-Server'. It likely serves as part of a larger application or package, possibly to specify the version information for the module.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in the given code, as it only contains a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no anomalies, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. It is a simple version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string value to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for Python modules to specify versioning. There are no other functions, data handling, external inputs, or outputs present. Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code by itself does not perform any actions or contain any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard practice for Python packages or modules to specify their version in this manner.",
