  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic module with a version string declaration. It contains no logic, external data handling, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The code does not pose any security threat or risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
