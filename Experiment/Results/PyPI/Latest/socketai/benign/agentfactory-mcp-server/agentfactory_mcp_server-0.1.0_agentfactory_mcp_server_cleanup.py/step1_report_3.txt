  "purpose": "Background task for TTL enforcement and container cleanup in a Docker environment, managing expired agents.",
  "sources": "Database queries fetching AgentMeta records; Docker API calls for container management; asyncio event loop for asynchronous operations.",
  "sinks": "Docker container operations (get, kill); database update function 'update_agent_state'.",
  "flows": "Database query retrieves expired agents -> For each agent, attempt to kill Docker container -> Mark agent as expired in database.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code present. No external network communications or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a background cleanup process that periodically checks for expired agents in a database, then attempts to terminate their associated Docker containers and update their status. It uses standard asyncio patterns and Docker SDK functions. No malicious activities, such as data theft, code injection, or unauthorized network activity, are evident. The process is straightforward and uses common libraries and patterns. There are no indications of hidden or malicious code. The database operations and Docker interactions are typical for container orchestration and cleanup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs routine container cleanup based on agent expiration without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It follows standard practices for async execution and Docker management. No malware or security risks are identified. The code appears safe for intended purposes.",
