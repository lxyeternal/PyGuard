{
  "purpose": "The code manages background cleanup of expired agents and their Docker containers, periodically removing expired agent data and containers.",
  "sources": "Reads agent expiration timestamps from the database; reads container information from Docker environment; reads configuration parameters for cleanup interval.",
  "sinks": "Kills Docker containers associated with agents; updates agent states in the database.",
  "flows": "Database query retrieves expired agents -> For each agent, attempt to kill container -> Update agent state to 'expired'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No external network connections or data exfiltration activities are evident. Uses standard Docker SDK methods and database access patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cleanup operations for agents marked as expired. It uses asyncio for concurrency and interacts with Docker to terminate containers associated with agents. The database operations are straightforward, querying for expired agents based on timestamps, and updating their status. Docker container management uses common practices with error handling for missing containers or Docker errors. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic identified. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to agent lifecycle management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical background cleanup task for managing agent lifecycle in a containerized environment. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and methods for container management and database interaction, with appropriate error handling. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
