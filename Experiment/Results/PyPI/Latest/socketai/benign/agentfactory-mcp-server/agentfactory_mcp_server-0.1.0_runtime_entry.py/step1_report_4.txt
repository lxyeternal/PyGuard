  "purpose": "Runtime entry point for an agent container that configures MCP servers and runs an AI agent based on environment variables and user input.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MODEL_ID, CONTEXT, PROMPT, TOOL_*_CMD, TOOL_*_ARGS), standard input/output, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Printing to stderr and stdout, calling agent methods, JSON parsing, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure tools and context, then passed to the Agent instance, which is executed asynchronously. Results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity or code injection. The code relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard but could be manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an agent based on environment variables, including dynamic configuration of tools through TOOL_* environment variables. It loads JSON configurations for tools and context, and executes an agent with these settings. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The code appropriately handles errors and exits on invalid input. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard setup script for an AI agent container.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and execution script for an AI agent container. It reads configuration data from environment variables, constructs agent and tool configurations, and executes the agent. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
