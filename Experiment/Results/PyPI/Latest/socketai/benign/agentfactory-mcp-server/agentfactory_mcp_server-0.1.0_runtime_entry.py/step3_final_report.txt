  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs an AI agent within a container, configuring MCP servers and tools based on environment variables, and executing the agent with optional context and prompts.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as MODEL_ID, CONTEXT, PROMPT, TOOL_*_CMD, TOOL_*_ARGS; external library pydantic_ai.Agent; JSON inputs for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Agent's run method output, printed to stdout; environment variables influencing behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; tool configurations are built from TOOL_*_CMD and TOOL_*_ARGS; agent is instantiated and run with these configurations; output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward container entry point that configures an AI agent based on environment variables, validates inputs, and executes the agent. It uses external libraries appropriately, with proper error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on environment variables is typical but could be manipulated if environment is compromised, which is a standard risk in such setups. The agent's run method is invoked, but without evidence of malicious activity or suspicious network connections. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not contain any anomalies that suggest sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard container entry point for deploying an AI agent. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and justified by environment variable reliance. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
