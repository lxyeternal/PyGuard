  "purpose": "The script serves as an entry point for an agent within a container, setting up MCP servers, creating an agent with a specified model, and running the agent with optional context and prompt.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MODEL_ID, CONTEXT, PROMPT, TOOL_*_CMD, TOOL_*_ARGS); External package 'pydantic_ai'; JSON data from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Agent creation and execution methods (agent.run), which may process untrusted data; printing output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; tool configurations and context data are parsed and validated; these are passed to the agent's methods, potentially handling untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables used for configuration pose typical risk but are standard; no unusual code constructs; external package 'pydantic_ai' usage is standard for such applications; error handling via sys.exit is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs a list of tools based on environment variables, which could be manipulated if environment variables are compromised, but this is typical. The agent is instantiated with these configurations and run asynchronously. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The use of environment variables for configuration is standard, and no code indicates malicious intent. The only potential concern is if the environment variables are maliciously set to craft specific tool behaviors or inputs, but this is an expected security consideration for any environment-dependent configuration. The external library 'pydantic_ai' is imported without suspicious code or obfuscation, and the code handles JSON parsing and errors securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard agent runtime setup that reads configuration from environment variables and executes an agent accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk is low, primarily reliant on the trustworthiness of the environment configuration. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected.",
