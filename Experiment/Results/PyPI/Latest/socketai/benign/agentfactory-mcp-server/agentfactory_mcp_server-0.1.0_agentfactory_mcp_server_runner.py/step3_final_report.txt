  "purpose": "Container launcher for agent execution, creating and monitoring Docker containers based on agent metadata and catalog data.",
  "sources": "Agent metadata (agent_row), catalog tools (load_catalog), environment variables, Docker SDK functions.",
  "sinks": "Docker container creation, environment variable assignment, container monitoring, agent state updates.",
  "flows": "Agent metadata and catalog data -> environment variables -> Docker container creation -> container execution -> container wait -> agent state update.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Docker SDK practices for container creation and monitoring, with proper error handling and environment variable management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Environment variables are derived from trusted sources, and container monitoring updates agent status accordingly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical container orchestration script with no malicious intent or security flaws. The environment variables and data sources are standard and appear safe. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. No modifications to the reports are necessary.",
