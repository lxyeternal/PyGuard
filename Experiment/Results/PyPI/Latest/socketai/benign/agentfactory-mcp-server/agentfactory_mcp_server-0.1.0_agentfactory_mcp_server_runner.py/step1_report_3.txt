  "purpose": "Container launcher for agent execution, managing Docker containers based on agent metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DEFAULT_AGENT_IMAGE), agent_row attributes (model_id, id, tools, context, prompt), external functions load_catalog and update_agent_state.",
  "sinks": "Docker SDK methods (containers.run, container.remove), environment variable usage, logging, network calls (docker.from_env, client.ping).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set from agent_row and catalog tools, used during container launch, and monitored via async task; updates agent state based on container exit status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of environment variables for image name is standard, not suspicious. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns. No suspicious external network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interfaces with Docker SDK to launch and monitor containers, passing environment variables derived from trusted metadata. Error handling is present for Docker exceptions. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. Use of asyncio for monitoring is standard. Environment variables are set explicitly and used for configuration. The code does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, network connections outside Docker, or executing untrusted code. The functions utilize standard libraries and Docker SDK, with proper error handling. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward container orchestration script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard container launch and monitoring script for agents, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs good practices for Docker interaction and error handling. No security risks or malware signatures are detected.",
