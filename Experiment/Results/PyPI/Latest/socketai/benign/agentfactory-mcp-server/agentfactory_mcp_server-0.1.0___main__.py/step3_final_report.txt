{
  "purpose": "Minimal script that imports 'mcp' from 'server' and executes 'mcp.run' with stdio transport, likely to start a server or process.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'server' module; call to 'mcp.run()' with 'transport' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' function, which could process input or perform actions depending on its implementation; potential external behavior unknown.",
  "flows": "Import of 'mcp' from 'server' -> call to 'mcp.run(transport=\"stdio\")' -> execution of external module's code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, directly invoking a method from an external module. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security implications depend entirely on the behavior of 'server.mcp', which is external and not provided. The code itself appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious control flow. The external dependency introduces some uncertainty, but within this snippet, no issues are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate; the low security risk score of 0.2 reflects the external dependency uncertainty but does not indicate immediate danger.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign server startup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on an external module whose behavior is unknown. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
