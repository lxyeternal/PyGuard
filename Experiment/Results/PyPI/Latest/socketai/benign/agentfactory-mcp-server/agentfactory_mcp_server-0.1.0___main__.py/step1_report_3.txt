{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs the MCP server from the 'server' module, using standard input/output for communication.",
  "sources": "Importing 'mcp' from the 'server' module; calling 'mcp.run()' with transport='stdio'.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' function likely starts server operations that may involve handling data streams; potential data handling points depend on 'mcp' implementation.",
  "flows": "The source (import and function call) flows into the 'mcp.run()' method which manages the server operation; no further data flow is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. Commented logging line suggests intended monitoring but is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The script imports an 'mcp' object from the 'server' module and executes its 'run' method with 'stdio' as transport, indicating a server process communicating via standard I/O. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no input validation, data handling, or network connections directly visible. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The 'server' module's implementation is unknown, so potential risks depend on that external code. Overall, the script itself appears benign with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements. Its security profile relies on the safety of the 'server' module, which is not shown. Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
