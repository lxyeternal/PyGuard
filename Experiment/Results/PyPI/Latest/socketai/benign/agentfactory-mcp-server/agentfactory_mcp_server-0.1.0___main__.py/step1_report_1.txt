{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a server component called 'mcp' from the 'server' module, likely to facilitate communication or service processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'mcp' from 'server'; usage of 'mcp.run()' function with parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' function could potentially act as a sink if it executes untrusted code or performs malicious actions internally, but from this code alone, no direct sink is visible.",
  "flows": "Input source: import of 'mcp'; flow to sink: calling 'mcp.run()' with specified transport parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Commented out logging is harmless and indicates typical operation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a component and initiates its 'run' method with a specific parameter. The 'mcp' module's behavior is unknown, but based on this code, it appears to be part of a server or communication process. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow. The commented-out logging does not impact the security assessment. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign, assuming 'server.mcp' is a legitimate, trusted component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign server initiation script with no evident malicious intent or security issues. Its safety depends on the trustworthiness of the 'server' module and the 'mcp' component it provides.",
