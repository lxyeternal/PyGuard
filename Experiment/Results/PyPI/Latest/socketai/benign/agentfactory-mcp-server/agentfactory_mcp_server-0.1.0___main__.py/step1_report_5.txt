{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and runs an agent factory MCP server, likely as part of a larger system for managing or communicating with agents.",
  "sources": "Imports 'mcp' from 'server'; calls 'mcp.run()' with 'transport' parameter",
  "sinks": "The 'mcp.run()' function may internally handle data transmission, but no explicit sinks are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "Code imports 'mcp', then calls 'mcp.run()' with specified transport; data flow depends on 'mcp' implementation, which is not shown",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a module, and runs its 'run' method with 'stdio' transport. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leaks. The commented logging line suggests prior logging, but it's inactive. Without additional context on 'server.mcp', it is not possible to determine if 'mcp.run()' performs malicious actions. However, based solely on this code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves to start a server component. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
