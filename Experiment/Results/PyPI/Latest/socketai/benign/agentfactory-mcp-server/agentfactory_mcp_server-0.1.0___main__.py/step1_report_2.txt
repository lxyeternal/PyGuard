{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run the MCP server using standard input/output transport.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from server import mcp', which retrieves the 'mcp' object or module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'mcp.run' with 'transport=\"stdio\"' could potentially be a sink if 'mcp' handles untrusted input or performs network operations, but this depends on the implementation of 'mcp'.",
  "flows": "Source: import 'mcp' from 'server'; Flow: 'mcp.run' invoked with 'transport' parameter; Potential sink if 'mcp' internally performs network or file operations based on input.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; commented out logging line may indicate previous verbose logging, but no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'mcp' from 'server' and calls 'mcp.run' with 'transport' set to 'stdio'. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are evident. The functionality appears straightforward and typical for server setup. Without insight into 'server' or 'mcp', no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code is minimal and lacks complex or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a simple server starter that initializes and runs the 'mcp' server over standard input/output. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
