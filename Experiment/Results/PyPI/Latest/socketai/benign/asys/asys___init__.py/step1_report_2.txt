{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package or module that imports an Agent class or function from a local module named 'agent' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .agent import Agent', which reads local module data; the assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of 'Agent' from a local module and setting the version string; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports an 'Agent' from a relative module and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or external data handling suggest no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a typical purpose of setting up a module with an import and version identifier, with no indications of malicious or security concerns.",
