  "purpose": "Minimal module setup importing Agent class and defining version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.agent), setting __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and version assignment with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal code. No malicious or security-related issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
