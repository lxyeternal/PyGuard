{
  "purpose": "The code imports an Agent class and sets a version string, likely as part of a larger module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a module and assigns a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'agent' and defines a version string. It does not perform any operations, data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive actions. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent. The simplicity suggests it is a standard setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is typical for a Python package's initial module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
