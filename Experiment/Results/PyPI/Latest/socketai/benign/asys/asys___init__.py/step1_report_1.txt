  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets a version string. There are no data inputs, external communications, or sensitive operations. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a simple module initializer or part of a package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines the package version and imports a class locally.",
