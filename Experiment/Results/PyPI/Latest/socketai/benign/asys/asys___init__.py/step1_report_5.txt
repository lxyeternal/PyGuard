{
  "purpose": "This code imports the Agent class from a local module and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.agent' for importing 'Agent' and defines a string variable '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement and the version string declaration, but there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The import is from a relative module, which is standard for package internal modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, likely part of a larger package. The version string is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code's simplicity suggests it's just part of a module setup or initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Python modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
