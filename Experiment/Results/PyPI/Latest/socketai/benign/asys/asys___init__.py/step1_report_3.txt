  "purpose": "Importing the Agent class from a local module and defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from a relative path and defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply imports and assigns a string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is common in package setup. The version string is statically assigned. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated elements. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and typical module definition snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
