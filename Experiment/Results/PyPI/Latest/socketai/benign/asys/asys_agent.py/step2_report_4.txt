  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward wrapper around the 'claude' CLI, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - The code constructs subprocess commands safely as lists, reducing injection risk.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity are reported.\n   - The code handles streaming and non-streaming outputs properly, with error handling and interruption management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and agree that the code is benign and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that potential risks mainly relate to untrusted input being passed to subprocesses, but given the implementation, this is mitigated by passing arguments as list elements.\n   - No critical logical flaws or security flaws are identified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The overall confidence levels are high, indicating thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - The only potential concern is misuse of user inputs, but this is typical for such wrappers and is mitigated by safe subprocess argument passing.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not contain or execute any malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions beyond standard security considerations.\n   - They correctly interpret that the code's behavior depends on external inputs but does not inherently contain malicious logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1–0.2** — Minimal security risk, mainly related to external input handling, which is typical and managed safely.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK wrapper around an external CLI tool. It does not exhibit any signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that the external 'claude' CLI itself is secure and trusted, as the wrapper relies on it.",
