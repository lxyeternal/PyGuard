{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the Claude CLI tool, enabling prompt execution with configurable options and tool permissions.",
  "sources": "Input prompts to the 'run' and 'run_with_tools' methods, environment variables for working directory, command-line arguments for subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run executions, which execute external commands; print statements for streaming output.",
  "flows": "User-provided prompt flows into subprocess commands via the 'run' methods, which execute 'claude' CLI with specified arguments and environment settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external domain connections; standard subprocess usage. The code does not handle or log sensitive information beyond command execution and output. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around the 'claude' CLI, constructing command-line arguments based on user inputs and executing them via subprocess. It manages allowed tools and output formatting, with options for streaming output and handling subprocesses. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors, is evident. The subprocess calls are standard and confined to executing the CLI tool, with output handling and error management. No hardcoded secrets or environment variable leaks are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate SDK interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK wrapper for the Claude CLI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages subprocess execution safely and does not contain malicious code or suspicious anomalies.",
