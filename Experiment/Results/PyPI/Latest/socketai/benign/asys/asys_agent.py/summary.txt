  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk SDK wrapper around an external CLI, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is cautious handling of user inputs, which is standard for such tools. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use, assuming the external 'claude' CLI is secure."
