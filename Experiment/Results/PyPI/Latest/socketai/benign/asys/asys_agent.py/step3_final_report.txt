  "purpose": "A Python SDK wrapper for executing the 'claude' CLI with configurable prompts, tools, and output options.",
  "sources": "User inputs via 'prompt' and 'additional_args'; environment variables; class attributes for allowed tools and working directory.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run executing external commands; output printed to stdout or captured as strings.",
  "flows": "User inputs are incorporated into command argument lists, which are then executed as external processes; outputs are streamed or captured based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; handles streaming and interruptions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs command-line arguments safely as lists, minimizing injection risks. It manages subprocess execution with error handling and user interruption handling. No malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The main risk stems from untrusted user inputs influencing command execution, but the implementation mitigates this by avoiding shell=True and passing arguments as list elements. The code is clear, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk SDK wrapper around an external CLI, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is cautious handling of user inputs, which is standard for such tools. Overall, it is safe and suitable for use, assuming the external 'claude' CLI is secure.",
