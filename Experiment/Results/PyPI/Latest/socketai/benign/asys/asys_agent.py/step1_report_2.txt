{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK to facilitate interaction with the Claude CLI tool, allowing prompt execution and output handling.",
  "sources": "Input prompts provided to 'run' and 'run_with_tools' methods, environment variables such as current working directory, command-line arguments constructed within the methods.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution via subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run; output display through print statements; stderr reading from subprocess; potential command injection if prompt or arguments are externally controlled.",
  "flows": "Input prompts and arguments flow into subprocess command lists; subprocess outputs are either streamed and printed or captured and returned; environment variables and internal attributes influence subprocess execution parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of subprocess with user-controlled input prompts and additional args poses a potential risk if inputs are maliciously crafted. The code includes handling for user interruption during streaming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around subprocess calls to run an external CLI tool ('claude'), with configurable options and streaming support. No malicious code or suspicious behavior such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. Potential security concern exists if prompts or additional_args are externally controlled and used maliciously, but this is typical for such a wrapper. No suspicious obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious side-effects detected. The subprocess calls are standard, and the code properly handles errors and user interruptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard interface for running an external CLI with configurable prompts and options. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks beyond normal risks associated with executing subprocesses with untrusted input. It appears safe, assuming the external 'claude' tool itself is secure.",
