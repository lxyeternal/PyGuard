{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK class for interacting with the Claude CLI tool, enabling prompt-based and tool-specific executions.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration options, command line arguments, and prompts; fetching environment variables (os.getcwd())",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions via subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run; printing to stdout/stderr",
  "flows": "Input prompts and configuration -> construct command -> execute via subprocess -> output or streaming back to user",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around the Claude CLI, constructing commands with specified parameters and executing them via subprocess. It handles streaming and non-streaming outputs, manages allowed tools dynamically, and ensures cleanup after temporary changes. All subprocess commands are parameterized based on inputs and do not execute untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration or hidden network activity. The environment interaction is limited to current working directory retrieval and subprocess execution, both standard for such SDKs. The use of subprocess is controlled and does not introduce code injection vulnerabilities, assuming the inputs (prompts, args) are not maliciously crafted to exploit the CLI tool itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, straightforward SDK wrapper for executing a command-line tool with configurable options. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats. No security risks are identified beyond typical subprocess handling. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
