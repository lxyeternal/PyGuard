{
  "purpose": "A Python SDK for interacting with the Claude CLI tool, allowing users to run prompts with specific configurations and tools.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'prompt' parameter in 'run' and 'run_with_tools' methods, and 'additional_args' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be output from subprocess commands, which can contain Claude's response or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input from 'prompt' and 'additional_args' -> command list 'cmd' -> subprocess execution -> output or error -> returned or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code executes external CLI commands with user-controlled parameters, which is expected for this SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs and executes command-line calls to an external 'claude' CLI tool, passing user-provided prompts and optional arguments. It manages subprocesses for streaming or non-streaming outputs, with error handling for subprocess failures. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident within this code snippet. The commands depend entirely on external input, which is typical for SDK wrappers, and no suspicious code is found to manipulate or exfiltrate data beyond expected subprocess interactions. The code does not include any network connections, data theft, or backdoor mechanisms. It uses standard subprocess handling and environment interactions, which are normal for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK wrapper for the Claude CLI, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within the provided code. It responsibly manages subprocesses and user inputs, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
