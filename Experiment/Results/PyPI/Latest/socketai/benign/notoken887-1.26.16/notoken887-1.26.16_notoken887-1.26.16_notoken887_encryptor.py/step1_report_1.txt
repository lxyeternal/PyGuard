{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple character-based encoding and decoding (obfuscation) for strings, likely for obscuring data rather than secure encryption.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform replacements on the input data, but do not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace '╢' -> replace characters with emojis in encrypt; encrypted string -> replace '╢' -> replace emojis with original characters in decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a basic character substitution scheme without any cryptographic measures; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network operations or system modifications observed; replacement of characters appears to be purely for obfuscation; no malicious actions or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for encoding and decoding strings via character replacements, substituting alphanumeric and some symbols with emojis and other characters. It performs straightforward string replacements without any complex logic, external input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, data exfiltration, or external communication. The code lacks any dangerous functions, such as system calls, network requests, or credential handling. The primary purpose appears to be simple obfuscation, not security or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution obfuscation utility. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities. It poses no threat based on the provided implementation.",
