{
  "purpose": "This class provides simple character replacement-based encoding and decoding (encryption/decryption) of strings, likely for obfuscation or lightweight encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings through the encrypt and decrypt methods, receiving the string to be transformed.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or send data externally, but it manipulates input strings; no external sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to encrypt/decrypt methods, undergoing sequential character replacements to produce encoded/decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacements for encoding and decoding but contains no operations involving external data sources, environment variables, or system calls. The use of replace() chains is straightforward, without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. The only notable feature is simple character substitution for obfuscation, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a symmetrical substitution cipher through character replacements, with separate methods for encoding and decoding. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious code execution are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification. The code is structured simply and predictably, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. Its purpose appears to be basic obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string obfuscation utility employing straightforward character replacements. It does not contain malware or security risks, merely encoding and decoding functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
