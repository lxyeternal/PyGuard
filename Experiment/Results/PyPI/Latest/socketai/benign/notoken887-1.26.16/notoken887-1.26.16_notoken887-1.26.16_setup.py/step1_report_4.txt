  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'notoken887' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements, package metadata fields, find_packages() function call, entry_points dictionary",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script mainly defines static configuration for packaging",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; standard setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "Author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional; URL 'https://thugging.org' is unusual and potentially malicious; no code obfuscation or malicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors. The only notable anomalies are the suspicious author email and URL, which may indicate malicious intent or simply unprofessionalism. No hardcoded secrets, input handling, or code injection points are present. The code's structure and dependencies appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with some suspicious metadata but no malicious behavior or security risks in its implementation. The package appears safe from a security perspective, although the provided URLs and email are unprofessional and potentially malicious.",
