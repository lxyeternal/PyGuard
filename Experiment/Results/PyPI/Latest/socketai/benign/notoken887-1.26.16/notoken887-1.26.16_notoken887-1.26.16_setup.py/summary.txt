  "conclusion": "The package is technically benign, with no active malicious code or obfuscation. Metadata anomalies (unprofessional email and suspicious URL) are noted but do not constitute security threats. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk is low (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns. Overall, the supply chain security is not compromised by the code itself, but metadata should be reviewed for professionalism."
