  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within setup() parameters, including author, email, URL, and entry_points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'notoken887.main:main' via console script; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org'; mention of 'obfuscation test lib' in description.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only anomalies are metadata indicators—unprofessional email and suspicious URL—that do not execute or embed malicious behavior. The console script points to a module that is not included here, but nothing in the code suggests malicious intent. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code, with low risk scores justified by metadata suspicion. No malware or obfuscation is present; the primary concern is metadata professionalism.",
  "conclusion": "The package is technically benign, with no active malicious code or obfuscation. Metadata anomalies (unprofessional email and suspicious URL) are noted but do not constitute security threats. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk is low (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns. Overall, the supply chain security is not compromised by the code itself, but metadata should be reviewed for professionalism.",
