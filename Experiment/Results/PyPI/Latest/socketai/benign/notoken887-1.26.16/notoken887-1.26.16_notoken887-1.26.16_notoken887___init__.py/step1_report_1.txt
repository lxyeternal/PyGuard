  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing and possibly communicates with external services, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables, environment variables, or external files (if present), but no explicit input sources are visible in the fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or subprocess calls, depending on code context. No explicit untrusted data handling or dangerous operations are evident from the fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks such as network or file operations. No explicit source-to-sink paths are visible in the fragment provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code appears straightforward with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not show suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. It performs typical data processing functions. Due to limited content, more context is needed for comprehensive analysis. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears standard and benign, though more context could provide a clearer assessment.",
