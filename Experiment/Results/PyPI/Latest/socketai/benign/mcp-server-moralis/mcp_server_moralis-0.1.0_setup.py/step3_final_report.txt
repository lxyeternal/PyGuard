{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of a Python project named 'mcp-server-moralis', specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI execution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies; defines 'main' module and CLI entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or dynamic inputs; no network calls, code execution, or environment variable manipulations present.",
  "flows": "Static data from files and hardcoded strings flow into setup() parameters; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected; standard setup script with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional 'setup.py' for packaging a Python module. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, and defines an entry point for CLI use. There are no dynamic operations, network activity, or untrusted inputs. The 'py_modules' and 'entry_points' suggest a 'main.py' with a 'main()' function, which is typical. All signals point to a benign, well-structured package configuration. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this analysis. The overall risk is minimal, and no malicious behavior is evident from this script alone.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores are justified. The package appears safe based solely on this code; further inspection of 'main.py' would be needed to confirm overall safety, but the setup script itself is trustworthy.",
