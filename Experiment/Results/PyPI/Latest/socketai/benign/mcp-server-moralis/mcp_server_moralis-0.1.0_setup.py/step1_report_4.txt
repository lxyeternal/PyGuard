{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mcp-server-moralis' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; reading setup parameters such as name, version, description, author, URL, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data sources are processed or outputted in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file for long description, then calls 'setup()' with project metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code execution, network activity, or runtime input processing occurs. The dependencies listed are standard packages related to development and deployment. The 'py_modules' parameter points to a module 'main', and an entry point is configured for command-line execution. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent within this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely as a configuration file for packaging the project.",
