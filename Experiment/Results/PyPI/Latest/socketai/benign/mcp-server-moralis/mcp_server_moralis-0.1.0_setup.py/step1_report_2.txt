{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'mcp-server-moralis', specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "File reading for README.md to obtain long description; package metadata (name, version, description, author, URL); dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points where untrusted data is processed or used insecurely; setup configuration is standard and does not handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only reads a file and specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code is a standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. No suspicious code constructs or behavior are present. All parts follow conventional patterns for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
