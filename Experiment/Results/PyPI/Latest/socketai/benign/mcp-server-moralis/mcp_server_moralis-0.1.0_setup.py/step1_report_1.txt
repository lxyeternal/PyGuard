{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'mcp-server-moralis', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies specified directly in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; setup configuration does not include network operations, file writes, or environment variable usage that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily sets package metadata and dependencies without processing untrusted input or executing dynamic code flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors; the code is standard for a setup script. The only notable point is the reliance on a 'main:main' entry point, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads a README file to set long_description. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or network operations are present. The dependencies listed are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The 'py_modules' specifies 'main', assuming a 'main.py' exists, which is typical for entry points. No signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The setup configuration appears to be straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical conventions without any suspicious code or activities. No malware, obfuscation, or security concerns are present based on this analysis.",
