  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores are justified. The package appears safe based solely on this code; further inspection of 'main.py' would be needed to confirm overall safety, but the setup script itself is trustworthy."
