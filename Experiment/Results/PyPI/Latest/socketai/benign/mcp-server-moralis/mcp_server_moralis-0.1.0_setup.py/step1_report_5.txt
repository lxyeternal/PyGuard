{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'mcp-server-moralis', configuring its metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for long description; it also specifies package dependencies and entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; the setup script primarily manages package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the README file, defining package metadata, and configuring entry points, with no data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to configure package distribution. It reads a Markdown README file for the description, then specifies package details including name, version, author, dependencies, and entry points. The dependencies are standard for development and runtime, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are detected. The entry point maps a command line tool to a function within the 'main' module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no suspicious activity or malware indicators.",
