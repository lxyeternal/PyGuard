  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'mcp-server-moralis' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, package metadata fields, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> Setting package metadata and dependencies -> Defining entry points and classifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py content, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration file using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no inputs from untrusted sources during execution; all data is static or file-based. The package dependencies and entry points are standard, with no indications of malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package configuration details.",
