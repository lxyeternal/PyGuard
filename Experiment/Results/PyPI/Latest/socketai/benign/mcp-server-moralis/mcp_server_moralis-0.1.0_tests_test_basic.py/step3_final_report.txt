{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing suite for the MCPClient API, designed to verify basic functionality such as wallet balance retrieval, token price fetching, and transaction details. It uses hardcoded test data and performs network calls to a local or test server.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from hardcoded wallet addresses, token addresses, and transaction hashes; loads environment variables via dotenv; makes API calls through MCPClient.",
  "sinks": "API call results are processed and assertions are made; no untrusted data is written or leaked; network calls are to a local/test server, minimizing external risk.",
  "flows": "Test data (wallet address, token address, transaction hash) is used as input to API calls; results are checked via assertions; no data flows to external systems beyond the API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation; environment variables are loaded but not misused; no secrets or credentials embedded; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for a blockchain API client. It uses hardcoded data, loads environment variables, and performs asynchronous API calls with assertions. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The network interactions are limited to a local or test server, and no sensitive data is processed or leaked. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and controlled nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a minimal risk score reflecting the controlled testing environment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
