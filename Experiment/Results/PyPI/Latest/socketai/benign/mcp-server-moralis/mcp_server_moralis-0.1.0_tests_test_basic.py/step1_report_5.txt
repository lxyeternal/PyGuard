{
  "purpose": "Unit testing of Moralis API MCP service's basic functions for blockchain data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv; imported modules; network calls through MCPClient.call_tool",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if sensitive info is mishandled; network request endpoints; assertion checks",
  "flows": "Data is read from environment variables and test data, passed to MCPClient methods, results are checked via assertions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow; use of local server URL is typical for testing",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured unit tests for blockchain data retrieval using a client library. It loads environment variables but does not explicitly use them in requests; the test addresses are hardcoded but standard. The network calls are made through a client object, and results are simply validated for existence. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. No suspicious obfuscation, payloads, or credential leaks are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a benign test suite for API endpoints without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for blockchain API endpoints with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions nor contains suspicious code patterns.",
