{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the basic functionality of the Moralis API MCP service, including wallet balance retrieval, token price query, and transaction details fetching.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv (though not used directly in the code), test data including wallet addresses, token addresses, and transaction hashes hardcoded within the test class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external sources that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded addresses and hashes) flow into API calls through the MCPClient methods, but these are controlled and trusted within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets beyond test data. No dynamic code execution or suspicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test environment using asyncio and unittest, calling methods on an MCPClient instance with fixed, hardcoded parameters. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. No sensitive information, credentials, or secrets are hardcoded, and no network connections or malicious behaviors are initiated beyond standard API testing. The code appears straightforward and follows typical testing patterns without suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a Python API client, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely interacts with an API using trusted test data. No malware or security threats are evident.",
