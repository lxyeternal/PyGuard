{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the basic functionalities of the Moralis API MCP service, including retrieving wallet balances, token prices, and transaction details.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables using dotenv.load_dotenv() and input parameters such as wallet address, token address, and transaction hash for API calls.",
  "targets": "Uses MCPClient to make asynchronous calls to API endpoints; no direct output or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are loaded at start, and test data (wallet, token, transaction hash) are used as input to API calls. These inputs are processed and results are asserted for non-null values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors are evident. Usage of environment variables suggests adherence to good practices. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unittest-based test suite for a local or mocked MCP API client. It loads environment variables but does not use them directly for sensitive info, instead relying on predefined test addresses and hashes. All API interactions are via a client object with asynchronous calls, which are properly awaited. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration, nor does it contain hidden backdoors or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate testing script for API functionalities. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses environment variables appropriately and adheres to standard testing practices.",
