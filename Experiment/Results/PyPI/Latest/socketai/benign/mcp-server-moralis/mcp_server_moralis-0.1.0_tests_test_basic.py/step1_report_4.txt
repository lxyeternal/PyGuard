{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the basic functionality of the Moralis MCP API client, including wallet balance retrieval, token price, and transaction details.",
  "sources": "Environment variables loaded via dotenv, network calls through MCPClient methods for 'call_tool' with specific parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network calls made via MCPClient's 'call_tool' method, which could potentially transmit untrusted data or sensitive information if misused.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke 'call_tool' with specific parameters (sources) leading to network requests (sinks) to fetch blockchain data, but no data is processed or stored insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of environment variables is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns observed. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit testing script for an API client, utilizing asyncio for asynchronous network calls. It loads environment variables securely and runs well-structured tests for blockchain data retrieval. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The network calls are for legitimate API functions and do not appear to transmit untrusted data maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a blockchain API client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations for testing API endpoints without any suspicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
