{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for testing the basic functionality of Moralis MCP API client.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from dotenv, initializes an MCPClient instance, and uses hardcoded test addresses and transaction hashes.",
  "sinks": "Calls asynchronous methods on the MCPClient which may send data over the network, but no untrusted input is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or hardcoded test data → MCPClient API calls over network",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded API endpoints, addresses, and transaction hashes; no user input validation or dynamic data handling. No secrets or credentials visible in code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a custom MCPClient, loads environment variables via dotenv, and defines a unittest.TestCase class with setup and multiple async test methods. It runs tests against a local MCP server with fixed test addresses and transaction hashes. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of hardcoded test data is typical for testing environments. The code does not include any network or file operations that could leak data or perform malicious actions. There is no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a blockchain API client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses hardcoded test data for verification purposes only. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
