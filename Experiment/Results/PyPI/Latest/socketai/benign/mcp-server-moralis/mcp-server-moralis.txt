      "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores are justified. The package appears safe based solely on this code; further inspection of 'main.py' would be needed to confirm overall safety, but the setup script itself is trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper for blockchain data access, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. It adheres to standard security practices, and the environment variable usage is appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to API key management outside the code scope."
