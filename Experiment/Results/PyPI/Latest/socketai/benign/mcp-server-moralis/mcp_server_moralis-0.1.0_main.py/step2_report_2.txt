  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the incident reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**\n- The code is a comprehensive wrapper around Moralis API endpoints for blockchain data retrieval.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are evident.\n- Environment variables are used for API keys, which is standard practice.\n- The functions mainly construct parameters and call external API endpoints, with no data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads detected.\n- The main() function performs environment validation and server startup, typical for such applications.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The code appears well-structured, with consistent parameter handling and clear documentation.\n- No logical errors or insecure practices are apparent.\n- The API calls rely on external endpoints; assuming these are legitimate, the code functions as intended.\n\n**3. Scores and Reasoning:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1), mainly due to reliance on environment variables for API keys, which is standard but should be secured in production.\n\n**4. Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n- The code depends on external API endpoints; if those are compromised, data could be misused, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- No signs of supply chain attacks, malicious backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n- Based on the code and reports, there are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities beyond the standard risks associated with API key management.\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for blockchain data.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard API wrapper risk, mainly API key handling)\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Ensure environment variables (API keys) are securely stored.\n- Regularly audit the API endpoints and dependencies.\n- No additional security measures are necessary solely based on this code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
