{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of API tools and resource endpoints for interacting with blockchain data, primarily through the Moralis API, for tasks such as fetching wallet info, NFTs, tokens, transactions, and other blockchain-related data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MORALIS_API_KEY), environment variable loading via dotenv, and function parameters for addresses, block numbers, and API calls.",
  "sinks": "API calls to evm_api with api_key and parameters; outputs include blockchain data such as wallet history, transactions, NFTs, tokens, etc. No direct data leakage points or data sinks indicating exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters (like addresses, transaction hashes) through API request functions to Moralis API, returning blockchain data; no data is processed or stored insecurely within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets or credentials; environment variable usage is standard; no obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code appears structured and intended for legitimate blockchain data retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple API tool functions for blockchain data querying via the Moralis API, with standard parameter validation and usage. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations. The environment variable for API key is used properly, and no sensitive data handling beyond API calls is visible. All functions are straightforward API wrappers. The main() function performs environment setup validation and server startup, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper setup for blockchain data analysis using Moralis, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only facilitates access to publicly available blockchain information with appropriate API key handling. No supply chain attack indicators or malware signatures are present.",
