{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a comprehensive wrapper around the Moralis API, providing functions for blockchain data retrieval such as wallet history, transactions, NFTs, tokens, and other blockchain analytics.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MORALIS_API_KEY), user parameters (addresses, hashes, dates), and external API endpoints via evm_api calls.",
  "sinks": "API requests over the network to Moralis endpoints, potentially logging or displaying responses; no file or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "User/env inputs → parameter construction → API call via evm_api → response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, transparent API wrapper for blockchain data, utilizing environment variables for API keys, with functions clearly passing parameters to external endpoints. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward, with standard practices for API interaction. The main() function validates environment variables and starts the server, typical for such applications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper for blockchain data access, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. It adheres to standard security practices, and the environment variable usage is appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to API key management outside the code scope.",
