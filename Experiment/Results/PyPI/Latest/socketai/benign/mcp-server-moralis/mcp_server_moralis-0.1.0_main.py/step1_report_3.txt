{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive interface to interact with various blockchain data through the Moralis API, including wallet, token, NFT, transaction, and resource data, intended for blockchain analytics and querying.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MORALIS_API_KEY, DEFAULT_CHAIN, DEFAULT_LIMIT); API parameter construction from function arguments; user input via function arguments such as addresses, token IDs, and dates.",
  "sinks": "API calls to evm_api functions with API key and parameters; potential data leaks if sensitive data is improperly handled or logged, but API key is retrieved only from environment variables and used directly in API requests.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or function parameters -> sink: evm_api API request with api_key and params.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets aside from the API key which is sourced from environment variables; no code injection or obfuscated code present. The code mainly consists of API wrapper functions and resource definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively wraps the Moralis API endpoints for blockchain data retrieval, with each function properly encapsulating parameters and making API requests using an API key stored in environment variables. The functions are standard API wrappers without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials are present; the API key is expected to be set externally. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or harmful system modifications. The structure is consistent and focused on safe data querying. The main function performs environment variable validation and runs the server without any malicious actions. Overall, the code is well-structured, primarily for blockchain data access, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive, legitimate API wrapper setup for blockchain analytics via Moralis, with no malicious behavior detected. It responsibly loads configuration from environment variables, uses standard API requests, and does not contain obfuscated or harmful code segments. Its purpose aligns with blockchain data querying and analysis, not malicious activities.",
