{
  "purpose": "Defines a tool function using the FastMCP framework that returns a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and instantiates 'FastMCP' with a server name.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imports and instantiation flow into the decorated function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The use of a fixed server name is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and creates an instance of 'FastMCP' with a static server name 'test-server'. It then defines a tool function 'test_tool' that takes a string argument and returns a greeting string. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a plugin or tool registration pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. There are no network communications, no system modifications, or credential handling in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up a tool function for greeting purposes within the 'FastMCP' framework.",
