{
  "purpose": "This code registers a plugin tool within the FastMCP framework, providing a simple greeting function.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'name' parameter of the 'test_tool' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'test_tool' function returns a string; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or network sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows directly into the return string, but no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from 'mcp.server.fastmcp', creates an instance with a static server name 'test-server', and defines a simple function decorated with '@mcp.tool()' that returns a greeting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity. The static server name is benign and likely a placeholder. The code functions as a plugin registration pattern, with straightforward logic and no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
