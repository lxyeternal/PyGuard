{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports and initializes a class from an external package and registers a tool function, likely for remote procedure calls or plugin functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mcp.server.fastmcp', instantiation of 'FastMCP' with a server string, and the '@mcp.tool()' decorator indicating function registration.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The code flow is: import -> instantiate 'FastMCP' -> define and register 'test_tool' function. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of external package 'mcp' might be relevant, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external package, creates an instance with a server name, and registers a simple function that returns a greeting string. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code appears to be a straightforward plugin or tool registration pattern. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for plugin registration or remote procedure call setup. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
