{
  "purpose": "Define a tool function within a FastMCP server context, likely for plugin or extension purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from mcp.server.fastmcp, instantiation of FastMCP, and decorator usage",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output, external network calls, or data leaks",
  "flows": "The code flows from import, object instantiation, to defining a decorated function that returns a formatted string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (besides the server name), or unusual behavior detected. The server name 'test-server' is a placeholder, not a credential.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module related to MCP (likely a messaging or communication protocol), creates an instance of FastMCP with a static server name, and defines a tool function decorated with mcp.tool(). The function simply returns a greeting message incorporating the input name. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Usage appears standard for plugin or extension functionality within a framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing a straightforward tool registration in a server framework without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
