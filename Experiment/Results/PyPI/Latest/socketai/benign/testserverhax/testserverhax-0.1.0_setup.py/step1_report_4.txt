  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup configuration with package dependencies and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The package dependencies appear standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown file for description, then configures package metadata, including dependencies from PyPI. The dependencies listed are typical package requirements; no suspicious or malicious dependencies are evident. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices without any signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It appears safe and typical for a Python package configuration.",
