  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module, with no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Reads 'app/README.md' for long description, defines dependencies in 'install_requires', and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data fetching or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads README content -> passes data to setup() -> installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'testserverhax' is suspicious but not malicious; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or external data fetching present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with standard dependencies and no malicious logic. The only red flag is the package name, which could be considered suspicious but does not reflect in the code or dependencies. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0 are appropriate. Security risk is low (~0.2) mainly due to the package name suspicion, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only concern is the package name, which does not impact security. Overall, the scores are appropriate and indicate a safe package.",
