  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or external data fetching. The only concern is the package name \"testserverhax,\" which may imply malicious intent but is not evidence of malicious behavior in the code itself.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low, possibly due to suspicious naming). Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected. The package name alone is not sufficient to score higher.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard setup script, no suspicious code or dependencies. The package name is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward setup script with standard dependencies and no suspicious logic. The package name is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard setup, no malicious behavior, just an unusual package name.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no malicious code or obfuscation, standard dependencies, benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The package name alone is not sufficient to assign any malware risk.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; all agree on 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate. The only potential concern is the package name \"testserverhax,\" which might be suspicious but doesn't constitute a security risk in the code itself.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect the suspicious package name but no actual security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only concern is the package name, which is not a security issue but could be considered suspicious in certain contexts.",
