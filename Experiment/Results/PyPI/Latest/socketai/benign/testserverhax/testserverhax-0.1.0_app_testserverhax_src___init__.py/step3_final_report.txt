{
  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic code features, environment variables, network communication, hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, and code snippets (if available).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, execution of dynamic code, access to environment variables, and file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into code execution or data transmission sinks, but no such malicious flows are confirmed in the reports.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal obfuscation (score 0.1), mention of dynamic features like eval/exec without evidence, limited code context, and limited code snippets, but no explicit malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate no evidence of malware or malicious intent, with malware scores at 0 and low obfuscation scores. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. The scores align with the reasoning that no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present, and the low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern. No significant discrepancies are observed across reports, and the assessments are reasonable based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring is consistent and justified, indicating a low security risk. Further review with complete code snippets is recommended for definitive assessment.",
