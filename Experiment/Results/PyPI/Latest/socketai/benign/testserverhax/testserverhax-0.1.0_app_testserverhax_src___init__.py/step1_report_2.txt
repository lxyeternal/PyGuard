{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility script that imports modules and performs some data processing or system interactions, but the exact function is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports modules, and possibly reads user input or files if present in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable access, depending on further code not shown.",
  "flows": "Uncertain without full code, but likely includes data flow from environment variables or inputs to output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious variable names or unusual code constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet contains only import statements and possibly incomplete or placeholder code. No malicious functions or behaviors are explicitly visible. The code structure is standard, and there are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. Due to the limited context, some assumptions are made, but based on current information, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, full analysis would require more complete code to confirm that no malicious activity occurs in unshown sections.",
