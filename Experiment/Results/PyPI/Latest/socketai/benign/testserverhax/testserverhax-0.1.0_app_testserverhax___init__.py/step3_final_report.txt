  "purpose": "Analyze the import statement from the 'testserverhax' module for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported components 'mcp' and 'test_tool' if they contain malicious code, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "Importing 'mcp' and 'test_tool' from 'testserverhax' without further code execution or data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'testserverhax' is suspicious and suggests malicious or hacking-related intent; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The suspicion stems solely from the module name, which is indicative but not proof of malicious intent. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting suspicion based on naming, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), justified by the module name's potential implications. The code's straightforward structure and lack of suspicious operations support these assessments. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe practices are observed. The scores are consistent with the minimal code and the suspicion based on the module name.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in execution, but the module name 'testserverhax' warrants caution. Current scores (malware 0.2, security risk ~0.3) are appropriate given the suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious activity. Further review of the package contents is recommended before trusting or deploying this code.",
