  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module `testserverhax` into the current namespace via `mcp` and `test_tool`",
  "anomalies": "The module name `testserverhax` is suspicious and potentially malicious, given the name suggests malicious intent or hacking activities; no other anomalies present in this fragment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, bringing in two components from a module named `testserverhax`. The module name is unconventional and indicates possible malicious intent or maliciously crafted package, which raises concern. Since this is only an import, there are no direct malicious behaviors or data leaks in this snippet. However, the module name warrants caution, and further review of the `testserverhax` package is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import from a suspiciously named module. While the snippet itself does not execute any malicious behavior, the module name raises suspicion. A comprehensive review of the `testserverhax` package is advised before use.",
