{
  "purpose": "Importing specific modules or functions from the 'testserverhax' package, likely for testing or malicious purposes given the package name.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads modules or functions from 'testserverhax'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution flow is evident from the import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'testserverhax' is suspicious, suggesting potentially malicious intent or testing tools designed for exploitation; the code itself is minimal and does not contain executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which imports 'mcp' and 'test_tool' from 'testserverhax'. The package name indicates possible malicious or testing behavior related to server hacking. Without additional code, it is not possible to determine actual malicious activity, but the package name is a notable anomaly suggesting potential security concerns. No other code constructs, data handling, or execution flow are present to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet alone is limited but the package name 'testserverhax' raises suspicion of malicious intent or testing of server exploitation techniques. As it is only an import statement with no further context, the risk appears low but warrants caution due to the naming and potential for malicious modules.",
