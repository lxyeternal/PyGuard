  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from the 'testserverhax' module, likely for testing or hacking purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement reads the 'testserverhax' module, potentially from a third-party or custom package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code snippet; no data processing or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'testserverhax' suggests malicious intent or hacking activity; this is suspicious. The code is minimal and might be part of a larger malicious toolkit.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components ('mcp' and 'test_tool') from a module named 'testserverhax'. The name indicates potential malicious or testing purposes, possibly related to server hacking tools. However, the snippet alone does not perform any malicious actions or data handling. The minimal nature of this code limits detailed analysis, but the module name raises suspicion about its intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is suspicious due to the module name 'testserverhax' implying hacking or malicious testing. It does not exhibit malicious behavior itself but suggests intent related to testing or hacking activities. Further analysis of the 'testserverhax' module would be necessary to confirm malicious actions.",
