  "purpose": "The code imports functions or objects 'mcp' and 'test_tool' from the module 'testserverhax'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'testserverhax' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'testserverhax' is suspiciously named, suggesting potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The code snippet is minimal, providing no context or functionality that clarifies purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which by itself is benign. However, the module name 'testserverhax' is highly suspicious and could be indicative of malicious or backdoor code designed for testing or hacking purposes. The minimal nature of the snippet does not reveal any malicious behavior directly, but the naming warrants caution. No source-to-sink data flows or malicious operations are visible in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself appears benign but is associated with a suspicious module name that suggests malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. Additional context or code is needed to determine if malicious behavior exists. Caution is advised if this code is part of a larger project.",
