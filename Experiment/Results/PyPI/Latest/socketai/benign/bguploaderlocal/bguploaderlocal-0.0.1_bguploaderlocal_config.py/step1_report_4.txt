{
  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for an application, including server URL and security-related parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded configuration parameters such as API URLs, allowed file extensions, and API keys.",
  "tails": "No explicit output or untrusted input processing present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as no input-output flow involving untrusted data is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API key ('default_api_key'), which is a security concern. The code comments out sensitive information, but the key remains in plain text within the source.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class with hardcoded values for server, API URL, allowed extensions, and an API key. The API key is stored as plaintext in the source code, which poses a security risk if the code is published or shared. No input validation, user input processing, or dynamic behavior is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard configuration code with a potentially insecure hardcoded API key.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with a security concern due to the hardcoded API key. There is no malicious activity detected, but the presence of sensitive credentials in code is a security risk that should be addressed.",
