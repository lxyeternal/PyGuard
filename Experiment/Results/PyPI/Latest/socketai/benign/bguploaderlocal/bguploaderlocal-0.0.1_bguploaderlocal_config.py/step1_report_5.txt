  "purpose": "Configuration setup for an application, including server URL and API key.",
  "sources": "The class constructor initializes configuration parameters, including 'default_api_key'.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of 'default_api_key' if the code is exposed, and usage of 'api_base_url' in network requests.",
  "flows": "Initialization of configuration parameters, with potential usage of 'default_api_key' in API requests.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded API key 'default_api_key' in the code. Commented out code is present but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with parameters such as server URL and an API key. The API key is hardcoded, which poses a security risk if this code is exposed publicly or in a shared environment. No dynamic input sources or external data reading mechanisms are present. The commented code is typical setup logic and not malicious. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the hardcoded API key, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or leaked. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage in the provided code snippet.",
