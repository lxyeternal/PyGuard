  "purpose": "Define configuration parameters for a web application, including server URL, allowed file extensions, and a default API key.",
  "sources": "The code reads the default API key from a hardcoded string in the Config class constructor.",
  "sinks": "The default_api_key is stored as a plain string within the class; if used in network requests, it could be sent unencrypted unless further protected.",
  "flows": "The API key flows from the hardcoded string to any process or request that uses the Config object and accesses default_api_key.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API key in plain text within the code. Commented-out code and multiple server URL options suggest configuration flexibility but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class that initializes several configuration parameters, including server URL, allowed extensions, and an API key. The API key is stored as a hardcoded string, which can be a security concern if exposed. No code executes malicious actions, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Commented-out setup methods imply potential for dynamic configuration but are not active. Overall, the code is straightforward configuration setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily provides configuration settings with a hardcoded API key, which may pose security risks if exposed but does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
