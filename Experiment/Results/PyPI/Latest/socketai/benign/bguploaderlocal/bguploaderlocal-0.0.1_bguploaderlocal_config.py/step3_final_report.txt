{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for setting up server URLs, allowed file extensions, and an API key. It appears intended for application configuration management.",
  "sources": "The code reads static values assigned to class attributes, notably the hardcoded API key 'self.default_api_key'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data beyond static assignments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply initializes configuration attributes with fixed values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded API key in plaintext within the class constructor; commented-out code suggests potential for dynamic configuration but is inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining static configuration parameters with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only security concern is the hardcoded API key, which could be exposed if the code is shared or compromised. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The API key's exposure poses a security risk but does not constitute malware or active malicious activity. The code's simplicity and clarity are confirmed, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration class with a hardcoded API key, representing a security best practice violation but no malicious intent or activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.3, reflecting moderate concern due to the plaintext secret. Overall, the code is benign but should be refactored to avoid embedding secrets directly.",
