  "purpose": "Configuration management for an application, defining API URLs, allowed file extensions, and API keys.",
  "sources": "self.default_api_key (hardcoded string), self.api_base_url (hardcoded string), comments indicating potential external configuration",
  "sinks": "self.default_api_key used in authentication or API calls (potential for credential misuse if exposed)",
  "flows": "Initialization of Config object leads to setting of API URL and API key; no external input directly processed at runtime in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API key, commented-out configuration method for environment-based URL setting; no input validation or dynamic configuration shown",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Config class with hardcoded API URL, extensions, and a sensitive API key. No external data inputs are processed here, but the hardcoded API key poses a security concern if the code is exposed or leaked. The commented method suggests potential for environment-based configuration, but it is inactive. No malicious behavior or sabotage is present. The code mainly serves as a static configuration container.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hardcoded API key, which is a security risk if exposed, but does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be standard configuration code with no suspicious or malicious activities.",
