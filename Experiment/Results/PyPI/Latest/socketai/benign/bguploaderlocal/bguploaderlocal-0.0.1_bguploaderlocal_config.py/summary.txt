  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration class with a hardcoded API key, representing a security best practice violation but no malicious intent or activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.3, reflecting moderate concern due to the plaintext secret. Overall, the code is benign but should be refactored to avoid embedding secrets directly."
