  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'bguploaderlocal', defining dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() function, including package dependencies, entry point, and metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed within this setup script.",
  "flows": "Configuration data used during package installation; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder author name; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The main security concern depends on the implementation of 'bguploaderlocal.cli:run', which is outside this snippet. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal risk based on static configuration. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a legitimate, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the CLI implementation, not the setup script itself. Scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
