{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for uploading files (single and multiple) to a remote API endpoint, validating file existence and extensions, constructing HTTP requests, and handling responses.",
  "sources": "Reads input files from disk via open(), retrieves API key from configuration or parameters, and reads request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files using requests.post() with files parameter, sends data over network, and processes JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Source: open() reading files, parameters from config; Sink: requests.post() sending files and data; Flow: file data flows from disk to network request, response is parsed.",
  "anomalies": "Files are opened with open() but not explicitly closed, leading to potential resource leaks; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file validation, request construction, and response handling for file uploads. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. Minor resource management issue exists due to lack of explicit file closure, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The use of API keys from configuration and standard libraries suggests benign utility code. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward file upload utility with no malicious or suspicious traits. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.2-0.3) are consistent with its functionality. Minor resource leak concerns do not impact security. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use with standard precautions.",
