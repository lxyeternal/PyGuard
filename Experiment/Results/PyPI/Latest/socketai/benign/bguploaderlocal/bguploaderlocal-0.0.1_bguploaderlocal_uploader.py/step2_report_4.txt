  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a set of functions for uploading files (single and multiple) via HTTP requests.\n- Uses `requests` library.\n- Reads API keys from configuration or parameters.\n- Validates file existence and extension.\n- Constructs requests with proper headers, including an API key.\n- Parses JSON responses and handles errors.\n- Files are opened with `open()` but not explicitly closed, which could lead to resource leaks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of malicious activity like data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Standard upload logic, reads config, validates files.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** Uploads via HTTP, handles responses.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, performs a typical upload operation, with proper validation. The risk is low; the only concern is network transmission of potentially sensitive data, but that's inherent to upload functions.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to inherent network risks)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Similar upload functions, reads files with `open()`.\n\n**Anomalies:** Files are opened with `open()` but not explicitly closed, leading to resource leaks. No malicious intent.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious behavior, just a resource management concern. The code is straightforward.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, reading files, uploading via API.\n\n**Anomalies:** Again, files opened with `open()` without explicit closure. No malicious code.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \nStandard upload code, no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Uploading files, validating inputs.\n\n**Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard headers.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \nAppears legitimate. No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Similar upload functions, with validation.\n\n**Anomalies:** Files opened with `open()` without explicit closure. Potential for resource leaks but not malicious.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \nNo signs of malware or malicious intent. The code could be improved with context managers (`with` statement) for resource safety.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher due to resource management concern, but not malicious)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.2-0.3) due to resource management concerns, but these are not security risks per se.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (default low risk for file upload code, unless misused)\n\nThe code is a standard file upload utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main concern is resource leaks due to not closing files, which is a best practice issue but not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary based on the code review.",
