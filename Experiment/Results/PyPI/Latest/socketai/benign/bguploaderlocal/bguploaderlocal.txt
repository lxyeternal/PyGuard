      "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for uploading XML files to specified API endpoints, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the handling of credentials and dynamic URLs. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent. The code's behavior aligns with a safe, standard application for file uploads."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration class with a hardcoded API key, representing a security best practice violation but no malicious intent or activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.3, reflecting moderate concern due to the plaintext secret. Overall, the code is benign but should be refactored to avoid embedding secrets directly."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward file upload utility with no malicious or suspicious traits. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.2-0.3) are consistent with its functionality. Minor resource leak concerns do not impact security. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use with standard precautions."
