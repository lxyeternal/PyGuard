  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages, assigning a version string to __version__. No data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any operations, external interactions, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and high confidence. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version marker with no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
