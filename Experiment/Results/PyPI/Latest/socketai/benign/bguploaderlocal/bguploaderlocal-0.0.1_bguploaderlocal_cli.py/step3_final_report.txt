  "purpose": "A command-line utility to upload a single XML file or all XML files in a specified folder to a designated API endpoint, with configurable server environment and credentials.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments: 'path' (file or folder), 'api_key', 'team_id', 'project_id', 'testrun_id', and 'server' choice.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external functions 'upload_file' and 'upload_xml_files_from_folder' which perform network requests to upload data to the API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used to set API URLs and credentials, then passed to upload functions which handle the network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; API URLs are dynamically set based on predefined choices, reducing arbitrary URL injection risk; API keys are passed via CLI, which could be insecure if not handled properly in deployment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that validates input paths, sets API URLs based on user choices, and invokes external upload functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only minor concern is passing API keys via command-line arguments, which is common but should be secured in production environments. External functions' security depends on their implementation, but their invocation here appears legitimate. The dynamic URL configuration is controlled via predefined choices, mitigating risks of arbitrary URL manipulation. Overall, the code demonstrates standard practices without signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for uploading XML files to specified API endpoints, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the handling of credentials and dynamic URLs. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent. The code's behavior aligns with a safe, standard application for file uploads.",
