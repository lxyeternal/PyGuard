  "purpose": "This script facilitates uploading XML files to a specified API endpoint, either a single file or all files in a folder, based on user input and configuration.",
  "sources": "User input parameters: 'path', 'api_key', 'team_id', 'project_id', 'testrun_id', 'server'.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to 'upload_file' and 'upload_xml_files_from_folder' which likely send data over the network using the provided API key and other parameters.",
  "flows": "User input → argument parser → configuration setup (API URL, server) → file/directory validation → upload functions → network request with potentially untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic configuration based on user input; no obfuscated code or suspicious string manipulations; standard argument parsing and network request patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user input for file paths and API credentials, configures network endpoints based on choices, and performs file uploads through external functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network connections outside the expected API interactions. The API key is received as a parameter, which is a typical pattern but relies on user discretion for security. The code does not execute any untrusted code or data transformations that could lead to injection or malware. The network URLs are explicitly defined and do not suggest malicious domains. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file upload utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this module. It relies on external functions for uploads, which should be reviewed separately for security, but the current code does not contain malicious logic itself.",
