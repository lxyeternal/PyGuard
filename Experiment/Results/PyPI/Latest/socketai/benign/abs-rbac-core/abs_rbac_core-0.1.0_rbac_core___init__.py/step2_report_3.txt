  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to RBAC.\n- No external data input, network activity, or dynamic execution is mentioned.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero across reports.\n- The confidence level is consistently high (1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code:**\n   - The code is purely import statements; no logic, data handling, or external communication.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or backdoors.\n   - All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n\n3. **Scores assessment:**\n   - Malware score is zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated score is zero, as the code is straightforward.\n   - Security risk is zero, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - Since the code only imports modules and does not execute any potentially malicious code, the risk score remains at 0.\n   - The high confidence and absence of anomalies support this.\n\n5. **Challenging assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that import statements are benign, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign import statements)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is only import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- If future code in the modules imported contains malicious code, that would need separate analysis.\n- As it stands, the code is safe.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
