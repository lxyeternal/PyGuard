{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific modules and classes related to role-based access control (RBAC) functionality, likely for implementing permission checks and related exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .decorator, .service, and .exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing happening within this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this minimal import statement; potential source-to-sink flows are not present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from local modules, which suggests modular design for RBAC functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual activity. The lack of data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution indicates a benign purpose at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of import statements related to RBAC modules and exceptions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
