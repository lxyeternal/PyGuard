{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific components such as a decorator, a service class, and exception definitions, likely for implementing role-based access control (RBAC).",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .decorator, .service, .exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs within these lines; they only import components.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only imports modules; no source-to-sink flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a package's __init__.py or similar structure; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from local modules, presumably to organize access control logic within a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or anomalies. The structure and content are typical of a modular Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward import statement block with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply references internal modules necessary for the package's functionality.",
