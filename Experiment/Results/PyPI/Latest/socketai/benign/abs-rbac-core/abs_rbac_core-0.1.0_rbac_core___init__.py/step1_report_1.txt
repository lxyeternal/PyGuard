{
  "purpose": "This code imports components related to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), likely to enforce permissions and handle exceptions within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.decorator', '.service', and '.exceptions'. No external data input detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are evident in the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating the setup for RBAC functionality. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. Since the code only references imports and does not execute any logic or data handling, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement setup for RBAC functionality with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical module initialization pattern.",
