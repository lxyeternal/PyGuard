  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to role-based access control (RBAC) functionalities, including a permission decorator, an RBAC service class, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present; only import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns are detected in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific components from local modules. No execution, data processing, or external communication occurs. The code appears to set up access control functionalities, which is common in secure application modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, performing standard module imports related to access control. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
