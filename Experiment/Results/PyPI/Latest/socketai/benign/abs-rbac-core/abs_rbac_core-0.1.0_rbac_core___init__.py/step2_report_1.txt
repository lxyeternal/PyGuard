  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to RBAC.\n- No data flows, external inputs/outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- All reports confidently (confidence=1) conclude the code is benign with no security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely import statements, which are typical in modular Python applications.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The code's purpose is to set up RBAC functionality, which is standard for access control.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: All reports are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk score: All are 0, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- Since the code only imports modules and does not execute any logic, process data, or interact with external systems, there is no basis for assigning higher risk scores.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module import setup for RBAC functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n- The assessments are appropriate given the code's simplicity and context.",
