  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:  \nThe code is simply:\n```python\nfrom .decorator import rbac_require_permission\nfrom .service import RBACService\nfrom .exceptions import *\n```\nThis indicates only import statements from local modules related to RBAC functionality.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code only imports modules and does not execute any logic, process data, or perform network operations. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \nNo errors or flaws are evident. The code appears to be a standard module setup for RBAC features.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which is reasonable since there's no active logic or data handling.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**:  \nNo claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly state that this is a benign setup.\n\n6. **Consistency of the Reports**:  \nAll reports are consistent in their assessment, with a high confidence level (1), and they all agree that the code is standard, non-malicious, and safe.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**:  \n- Since these are only import statements, the actual security implications depend on the content of the imported modules.  \n- If the imported modules themselves contain malicious code, that would be a concern, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence.\n\n**Final assessment and recommendations**:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** should stay at **0**.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scores.**\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code snippet is benign, standard module import setup for RBAC functionality, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The current scoring is appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
