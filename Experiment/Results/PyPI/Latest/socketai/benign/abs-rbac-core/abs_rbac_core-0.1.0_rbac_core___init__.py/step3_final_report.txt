{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to RBAC functionality, likely to set up access control features within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .decorator, .service, and .exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules without executing logic or handling data.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond module loading occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating setup for RBAC features. There is no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external communication. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these scores. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import setup for RBAC functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The assessments and scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
