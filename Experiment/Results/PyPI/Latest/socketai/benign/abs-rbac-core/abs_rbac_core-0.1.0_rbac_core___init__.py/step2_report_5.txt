  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to RBAC functionality.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, data handling, network activity, or other potentially malicious operations.\n   - The code appears benign and standard for setting up modular access control components.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code only performs import statements.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security issues, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is purely structural, setting up module imports, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain obfuscated code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations: the code only imports modules.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (benign import statements)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a typical setup for modular RBAC functionality, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated scores, with a security risk score of zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain all scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
