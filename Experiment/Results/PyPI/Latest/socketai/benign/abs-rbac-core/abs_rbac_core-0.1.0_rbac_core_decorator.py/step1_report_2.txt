{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to enforce user permissions via RBAC checks before executing a function.",
  "sources": "current_user input from function arguments, permissions argument, rbac_service.check_permission method",
  "sinks": "Potential permission checks, raising exceptions on invalid permissions or lack of permissions",
  "flows": "current_user['uuid'] and permissions are used to verify permissions through rbac_service.check_permission before function execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual behavior; proper validation of permission format; uses async function",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator for permission enforcement that extracts user ID from input, validates permissions, and calls a permission check method. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. The function performs standard permission validation and exception handling. No external network or data exfiltration actions are present. Usage of rbac_service is a standard pattern for permission checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward permission enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs standard validation, permission checks, and exception raising, with no hidden backdoors or data leaks.",
