  "purpose": "Enforces user permissions by validating 'resource:action' strings against an external RBAC service before executing the wrapped async function.",
  "sources": "current_user['uuid'], permissions list, permission strings, rbac_service.check_permission",
  "sinks": "rbac_service.check_permission calls, exception raising for permission errors",
  "flows": "Extract user UUID -> parse permission strings -> call rbac_service.check_permission -> raise error if no permission -> execute original function",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async decorator for permission validation, extracting user UUID, parsing permission strings, and invoking an external RBAC service. It handles errors appropriately and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.1-0.2). The reliance on an external service is standard, and no vulnerabilities are evident within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure permission enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's straightforward logic.",
