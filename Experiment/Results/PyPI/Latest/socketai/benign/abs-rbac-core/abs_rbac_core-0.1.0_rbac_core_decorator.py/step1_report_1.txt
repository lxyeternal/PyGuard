{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to enforce user permissions based on roles, checking if the current user has required permissions before executing the decorated function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'uuid' from 'current_user' and permission strings from the 'permissions' argument.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to 'rbac_service.check_permission' which verifies user permissions; the decorator may raise exceptions if permissions are missing.",
  "flows": "Input 'current_user' with 'uuid' flows into 'check_permission' via 'user_uuid'; permission strings are split into 'resource' and 'action' and passed to 'check_permission'. If permissions are missing, exceptions are raised before function execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without obfuscated or unusual constructs. The 'rbac_service' is passed as an argument, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard permission-check decorator that extracts user ID and verifies permissions via an external service. It raises exceptions if the user lacks permissions or if input formats are invalid. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification. No obfuscation or malware-like patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical permission enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly validates input and relies on an external RBAC service for permission checks. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
