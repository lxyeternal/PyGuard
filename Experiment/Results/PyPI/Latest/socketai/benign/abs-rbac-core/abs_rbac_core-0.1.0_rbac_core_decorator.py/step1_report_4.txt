  "purpose": "Decorator for enforcing user permissions based on resource:action strings using RBAC service.",
  "sources": "current_user.get('uuid') to retrieve user ID, rbac_service.check_permission for permission validation.",
  "sinks": "Permission checks via rbac_service.check_permission; raises exceptions on failure.",
  "flows": "current_user['uuid'] -> rbac_service.check_permission -> exception or permission granted -> function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Proper error handling for permission format.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async decorator that enforces permissions by extracting user ID and verifying permissions with an RBAC service. It performs standard validation, raises explicit errors, and correctly wraps the target function. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be a typical permission enforcement mechanism without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward permission enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for access control.",
