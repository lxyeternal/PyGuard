  "purpose": "Decorator to enforce user permissions based on resource:action strings using an RBAC service.",
  "sources": "current_user dict (reads 'uuid'), permissions list/string (input parameter), rbac_service.check_permission method",
  "sinks": "rbac_service.check_permission (potentially external service call), raising PermissionDeniedError",
  "flows": "Permission input -> permission split -> check_permission call -> exception or continue -> function execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async decorator that verifies user permissions before executing the wrapped function. It retrieves the user UUID from the current_user dictionary, validates permission string format, and calls an external RBAC service to verify permissions. The flow involves straightforward validation, permission check, and error raising if denied. No hardcoded secrets, external malicious calls, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The logic appears standard for permission enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard permission checking logic with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external service for permission verification, which is typical. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
