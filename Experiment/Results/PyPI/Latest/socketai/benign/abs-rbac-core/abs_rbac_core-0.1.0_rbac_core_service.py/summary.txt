  "conclusion": "The codebase is a legitimate RBAC implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor debug print statements should be removed or replaced with proper logging. The security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The overall security posture is sound."
