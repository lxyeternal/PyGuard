  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exception classes for role and permission management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Importing HTTPException and status from fastapi; class constructors with default error details.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls passing status codes and details, which are internal; no external sinks.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation -> super().__init__() with predefined status code and message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes for common role and permission errors, inheriting from FastAPI's HTTPException. All classes initialize with fixed status codes and default error messages, which are standard and safe. No user input is processed or directly incorporated into the exceptions, minimizing risk of injection or leaks. The structure is clear, straightforward, and adheres to typical exception handling patterns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom HTTP exceptions for role-based access control. It contains no malicious code or security risks.",
