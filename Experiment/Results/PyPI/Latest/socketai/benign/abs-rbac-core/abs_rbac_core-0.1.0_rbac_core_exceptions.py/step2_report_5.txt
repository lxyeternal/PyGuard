  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's `HTTPException`.\n- Each class sets specific status codes and default messages related to role and permission management.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to standard practices.\n- No input processing, data sinks, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code does **not** contain any errors, flaws, or malicious behavior.\n   - All classes are correctly inheriting from `HTTPException`.\n   - Default messages and status codes are appropriate.\n   - No dynamic code, external data, or input handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign, and purely declarative.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The default messages are static; while this could be a concern if messages leak sensitive info, here they are generic and safe.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any actual risk or malicious activity.\n   - The code is purely for error handling with no external data or dynamic execution.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - Malware score should be **0**.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as standard.\n   - The static default messages are typical and do not leak sensitive info.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a textbook example of defining custom exceptions in FastAPI.\n- No supply chain or security concerns are evident.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n**I agree with the reports' conclusions: the code is benign, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This analysis confirms that the code is safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.**",
