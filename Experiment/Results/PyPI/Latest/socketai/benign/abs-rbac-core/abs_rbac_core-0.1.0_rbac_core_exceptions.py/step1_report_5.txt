  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exception classes for role and permission management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from fastapi; class constructors setting HTTP status codes and default messages.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__ calls passing status_code and detail; no direct data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (optional detail strings) flows into super().__init__ calls, setting exception responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. All code adheres to standard FastAPI exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from HTTPException, with fixed status codes and default messages for role and permission errors. There are no input sanitization or external data handling beyond default message parameters. No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or data leaks are present. Usage of standard exception patterns indicates typical behavior. No obfuscation or hidden code is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions intended for use in a FastAPI application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
