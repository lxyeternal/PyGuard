  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code defines custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's `HTTPException`. The code is static, with no dynamic data processing, input handling, or external data sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is purely declarative, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- obfuscated: 0\n- malware: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores seem reasonable given the code's nature. Since the code is simple class definitions for exceptions, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \nThe reports assign a securityRisk of 0, which is justified because the code does not process untrusted input, does not execute dynamic code, and does not contain vulnerabilities. No reason exists to elevate the risk score.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**  \nAll reports correctly assign malware score as 0, since there is no malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads present.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nThe reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on static code analysis. They correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely declarative, defining custom exception classes for FastAPI.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The static nature and standard pattern of the code confirm the benign assessment.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exceptions for role and permission management in a FastAPI application. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Security risk score: **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
