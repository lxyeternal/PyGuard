  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from FastAPI's `HTTPException`.\n- All classes assign fixed status codes and default messages, with optional override via `detail`.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard, and benign. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, non-malicious, and contains no security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no data sinks or external data handling.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate regarding the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential minor critique:** The reports mention that static default messages could be modified to leak information if misused, but this is standard and not an actual flaw in the code as provided.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**3. Score Justifications and Suggestions:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The `confidence` is 1, which is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No score adjustments needed; the assessments are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**4. Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes without any external or untrusted data handling, no security risk exists.\n- No malware activity is present; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions and Their Validity:**\n- The reports assume the code is only for error handling and contains no malicious intent, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the code is transparent.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall assessment:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a FastAPI app. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign and follows best practices for defining custom exceptions.\n- The reports correctly identify the code's nature.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are appropriate; the code poses no security threat.",
