  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's HTTPException for role and permission management.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions with fixed status codes and default messages.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted input handling; static code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with fixed parameters; no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from FastAPI's HTTPException, with static status codes and messages. There are no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, standard, and benign, serving error handling purposes. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for role and permission management in a FastAPI application. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
