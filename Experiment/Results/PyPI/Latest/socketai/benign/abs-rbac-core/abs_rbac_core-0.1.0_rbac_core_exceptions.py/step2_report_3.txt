  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code defines straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's `HTTPException`.\n- No external data, input handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The purpose is standard error handling for role and permission management.\n- The code appears clean, well-structured, and aligned with best practices.\n\n**Confirmation of Code Content:**\n- The code only defines exception classes with fixed status codes and default messages.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- No data sinks or external data flows that could pose security risks.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The code is straightforward; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The default messages are static, which is typical; no risk of leakage or misuse is apparent.\n- No issues with the implementation.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n**Potential Risks & Justification:**\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n- The static default messages do not introduce security concerns in this context.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for FastAPI.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as safe, with no malicious or security issues. The scoring is appropriate, and there is no need for adjustments.",
