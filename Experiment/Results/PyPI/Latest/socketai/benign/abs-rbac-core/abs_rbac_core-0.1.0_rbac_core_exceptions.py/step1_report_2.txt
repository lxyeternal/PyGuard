{
  "purpose": "Defines custom HTTP exception classes for role and permission management errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Imports from FastAPI (`HTTPException`, `status`) used for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Exceptions are raised to the FastAPI framework which then returns HTTP error responses.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated with specific details and raised to be handled by FastAPI, resulting in HTTP responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. The code strictly defines custom exceptions with fixed status codes and default messages.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for common authorization and resource-not-found errors in a FastAPI app. Each class extends `HTTPException` with specific status codes and default messages, facilitating consistent error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed within this code. It is purely declarative for error management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom HTTP exceptions for role and permission error handling. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
