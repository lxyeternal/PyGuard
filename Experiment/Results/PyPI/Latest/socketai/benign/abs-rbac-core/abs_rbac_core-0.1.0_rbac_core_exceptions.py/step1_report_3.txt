  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exceptions for role and permission management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from fastapi, class initializations, and super() calls for exception raising.",
  "sinks": "Super() constructor calls that trigger HTTPException responses with specific status codes and messages.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of custom exception classes leads to raising HTTPException with predefined details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of HTTPException for different error scenarios, each with hardcoded status codes and default messages. These classes serve to standardize error handling in the application. No user input is directly processed or passed into these classes, and no dynamic data flows from untrusted sources. The code appears clean, well-structured, and intended solely for exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The only potential concern is that default error messages are static and could be modified to leak information if misused, but this is standard practice for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception classes for FastAPI that define specific HTTP error responses. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be purely for standard error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
