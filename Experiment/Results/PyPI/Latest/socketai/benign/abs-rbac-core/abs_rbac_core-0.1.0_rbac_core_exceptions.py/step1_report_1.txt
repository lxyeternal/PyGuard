{
  "purpose": "Define custom HTTP exception classes for role and permission management in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; all classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks; it only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement; class instantiations are straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code appears standard and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's HTTPException, each with preset status codes and default messages related to role and permission errors. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure and content suggest standard practice for error handling in web APIs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of straightforward, non-malicious custom exception classes for handling role and permission errors in a FastAPI app. It does not contain malware or security issues.",
