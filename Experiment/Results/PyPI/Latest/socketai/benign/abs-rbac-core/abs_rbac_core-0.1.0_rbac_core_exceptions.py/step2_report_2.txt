  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes inheriting from FastAPI's HTTPException for role and permission management.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static class definitions, instantiation with fixed status codes and messages, no external data or dynamic code execution.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and safe, serving solely for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Are the reported issues present in the code?\n**Yes.** The code matches the description: static class definitions for custom exceptions with no external data handling or malicious code.\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n**No.** The reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign, and non-malicious. They do not overlook any suspicious patterns or potential security issues.\n\n### Step 3: Scores review\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malware behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified given the code's nature.\n\n**No changes needed**; the scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n### Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- If any score were higher, I would justify it based on dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious payloads, none of which are present here.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions\n- The assumption that static class definitions are safe is valid.\n- No hidden malicious intent or backdoors are evident.\n- The default messages are static but standard practice; no indication of information leaks or sensitive data.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and code structure.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom HTTP exceptions for role and permission management in a FastAPI application. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
