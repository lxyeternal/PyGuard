  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It displays decorative banners and messages in the terminal.\n- Uses `get_terminal_size()` to adapt formatting.\n- Uses `sleep()` to animate text.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No obfuscation, credentials, or malicious code.\n- Functions are purely for aesthetic terminal output.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Malware:** Score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** Score of 0 is justified.\n- **Security risk:** Score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely decorative and safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- No issues found that warrant raising any scores.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The use of `get_terminal_size()` and `sleep()` is standard for terminal animations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is purely aesthetic, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scoring is appropriate.",
