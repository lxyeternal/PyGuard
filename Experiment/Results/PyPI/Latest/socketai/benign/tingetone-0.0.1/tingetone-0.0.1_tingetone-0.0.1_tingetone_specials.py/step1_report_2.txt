  "purpose": "Display decorative banners and messages for Independence Day and user appreciation in the terminal.",
  "sources": "get_terminal_size() for terminal dimensions; sleep() for timing delays; print() for output display.",
  "sinks": "print() statements outputting to terminal; no untrusted data or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Terminal size detection influences layout; message strings are static; display flow is straightforward with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of Unicode characters and sleep delays are benign and related to visual effects.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and functions for terminal size detection and output formatting. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are involved. Sleep delays are used for animation effects. No indications of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscation present. Overall, the code appears purely decorative with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script solely creates visual banners and messages in the terminal, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It is safe and intended for user interface purposes.",
