{
  "purpose": "Display celebratory banners and messages in the terminal, specifically for an Independence Day celebration and a thank you message for using a software named 'tingetone'.",
  "sources": "Read terminal size using os.get_terminal_size(). No other external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output using print() functions. No other sinks like network, file, or environment variables are used.",
  "flows": "Terminal size is obtained (source) and used to format and align output (sink). No untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code relies on standard library functions for terminal output and delays. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, 'flag()' and 'banner()', which generate formatted terminal banners and messages. It uses standard library calls to get terminal size and prints stylized text. There is a sleep delay to animate the message display. No external input is read beyond the terminal size, and no sensitive data, network activity, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely aesthetic, intended to display banners and messages in the terminal. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code are evident. It is a benign script for user interface enhancement.",
