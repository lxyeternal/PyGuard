{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to display decorative terminal banners for an Independence Day celebration and a thank-you message, enhancing user interface presentation.",
  "sources": "Input source: terminal size obtained via get_terminal_size(). Data read from environment (terminal state), but no user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks include print statements that display formatted text to the terminal. No data is sent externally, written to files, or used in network communication.",
  "flows": "Input from get_terminal_size() determines terminal width for formatting; this influences the display layout but does not affect external systems. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code employs standard libraries and functions with benign purpose. No unusual dynamic execution, no data leaks, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and local components, then defines two functions, flag() and banner(), both purely for aesthetic terminal output. They handle terminal size detection and dynamic text display with delays. The use of get_terminal_size() is typical for formatting, with exception handling for OSError. No external data, network activity, or cryptic code is involved. The overall behavior aligns with standard CLI decoration, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for visual presentation and user interface enhancement, with no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks detected. It performs straightforward terminal output formatting and timing delays. The overall security risk score is very low.",
