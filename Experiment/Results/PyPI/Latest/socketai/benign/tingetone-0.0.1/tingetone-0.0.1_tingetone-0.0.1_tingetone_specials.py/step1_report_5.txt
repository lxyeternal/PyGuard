{
  "purpose": "Display decorative banners and messages for an Independence Day special and user appreciation, with animated effects in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input data is derived from terminal size via get_terminal_size(). No external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print() are used to display messages; no data leakage, external communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input from get_terminal_size() influences the formatting of output. The text messages are static, with no data flow to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected. The code performs standard terminal output with sleep delays for animation effects.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves terminal size to format banners and messages, with fallback size if an error occurs. It uses sleep delays to animate text. There are no external data transmissions, no code injections, or malicious functions. The functions are straightforward, focusing on aesthetic terminal output. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for decorative terminal banners and animations without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, secret backdoors, or harmful operations.",
