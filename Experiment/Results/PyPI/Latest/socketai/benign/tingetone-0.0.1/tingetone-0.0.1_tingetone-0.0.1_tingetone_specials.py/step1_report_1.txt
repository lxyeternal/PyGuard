{
  "purpose": "The code displays a decorative banner and an Independence Day message in the terminal, and then a thank you message with a loading animation.",
  "sources": "Read terminal size using get_terminal_size; use sleep function for timing delays",
  "sinks": "Print statements for output; no data leakage or network activity",
  "flows": "Input (terminal size) influences output formatting and animation timing, but no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code uses Unicode characters and formatting for aesthetic purposes only. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily generates terminal-based visual output with decorative banners and animated text. It retrieves terminal size to format the display, and uses sleep to create animation effects. No input data from untrusted sources is processed beyond terminal size detection, which is standard and safe. The code does not perform network activity, file modifications, or system alterations. All functions and variables serve aesthetic and user interface purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for aesthetic display in the terminal and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. Overall, it is safe.",
