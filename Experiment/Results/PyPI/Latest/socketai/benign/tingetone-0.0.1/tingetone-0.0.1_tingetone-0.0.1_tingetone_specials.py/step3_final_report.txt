{
  "purpose": "The code displays terminal banners and animated messages for aesthetic purposes, celebrating Independence Day and thanking users.",
  "sources": "Terminal size detection via get_terminal_size(), string literals for messages, Unicode characters, and sleep() for animation timing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network, file, or data leak operations present.",
  "flows": "Terminal size detection -> formatted string construction -> animated printing with sleep delays.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries for terminal UI; no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for aesthetic terminal display, utilizing standard library functions for terminal size detection and animation effects. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or modify system state. The Unicode characters and delays are benign, serving visual purposes. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose. The high confidence score reflects the straightforward, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for aesthetic terminal output. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The current scores are justified and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
