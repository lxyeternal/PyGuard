  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward utility module defining color constants and an exception class. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscated logic.\n   - Since the reports contain \"Empty response\" and no additional details, there is no evidence of embedded malware, malicious behavior, or security flaws within this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n   - The reports are empty; they do not contain any analysis, reasoning, or conclusions about the code.\n   - Therefore, there's no flawed reasoning to critique or correct.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - No issues are identified in the reports; thus, any scores assigned are unwarranted.\n   - Without evidence of problems, scores should be minimal or zero.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since no issues are reported, assigning high risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - It simply defines constants and an exception class.\n   - Malware score should be very low or zero.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made; the reports are empty.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Given the lack of content, any scores should reflect the absence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. The code is simple, benign, and does not warrant concern. Therefore, the scores should be at the lowest levels, reflecting no risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No action needed; the code appears safe and well-structured.",
