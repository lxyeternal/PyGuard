{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports and exposes functions and constants related to colored printing and utilities, defining a version and public API.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (.color_print, .utils, .fore)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules, then exports selected symbols via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package entry point with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. It only imports internal functions and constants, then exposes them via __all__. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or malicious logic support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
