{
  "purpose": "To serve as an entry point for importing color printing and utility functions related to colored output and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.color_print, .utils, .fore), and the module's own version and all exports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no dynamic data flows, no user input, no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. The code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various functions and classes from internal modules, defines a version string, and specifies __all__ for exports. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute untrusted input. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign entry point for a Python package that manages colored printing functions. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are detected.",
