  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory path and loads README.md content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata passed to setup().",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file reads to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports pathlib and setuptools, defines a version, reads the README.md file, and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
