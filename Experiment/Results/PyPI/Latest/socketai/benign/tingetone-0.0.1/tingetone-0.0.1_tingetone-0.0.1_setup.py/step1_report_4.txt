  "sources": "Reads the __file__ path for current directory and reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads file path -> loads README content -> passes metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code performs standard packaging setup without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets package metadata, reads the README file, and invokes setup() to prepare the package. All operations are standard for Python packaging and contain no suspicious or malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or other risky behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely facilitates the packaging process for distribution.",
