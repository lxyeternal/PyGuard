{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for colored terminal output, including text styling (bold, italic, underline), colored printing, and formatted text output with various colors.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'text', 'color', 'on_color', and optional parameters provided to functions such as warn, error, info, success, and line.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print() are used to display styled text on the terminal; no direct data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into formatting functions, then to the print() statements or return statements for styled text output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. The only external references are to the imported 'COLORS', 'ON_COLORS', and 'InvalidColorError' from a utils module, which are standard for styling. The system call on Windows is benign, likely for environment setup. No dynamic execution or external data fetching is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines terminal styling functions and output methods. It imports platform and os modules but does not utilize user inputs or execute untrusted code. No data leaks, network connections, or suspicious behavior such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The system call on Windows appears to be a placeholder or environment setup step, not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling library without any malicious or security-compromising behaviors. It solely formats and outputs styled text. There are no indicators of malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks.",
