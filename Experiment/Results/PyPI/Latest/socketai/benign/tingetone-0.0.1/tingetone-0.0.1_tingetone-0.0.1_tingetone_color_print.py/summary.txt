  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the `system('')` call on Windows, which is harmless. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the negligible risk associated with the no-op system call."
