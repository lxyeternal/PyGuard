{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for terminal output styling, including colored, bold, underlined, and styled text, as well as printing functions for different message types (info, warning, error, success).",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from function parameters and platform/system calls (platform.system(), get_terminal_size). It also imports external modules (.utils).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs styled text via print statements and string formatting. No untrusted data is directly written to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, color, on_color, strong) flow into styling functions, which process them and output styled strings via print or return.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The only notable feature is a call to system('') on Windows, which may be a placeholder or attempt to invoke a shell, but is benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of terminal styling utilities using ANSI escape codes, with proper validation against predefined color sets. It imports only local utility modules and standard system modules. The system('') call on Windows is benign and often used to initialize terminal settings. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The overall design aligns with typical styling utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward styling utility module for terminal output with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor point is the 'system('')' call on Windows, which is unlikely to be harmful in this context. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
