{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal styling functions such as colored, bold, italic, underline, and styled print outputs for terminal applications.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (text, color, on_color), imported color dictionaries (COLORS, ON_COLORS), and environment detection via platform.system() and get_terminal_size().",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input beyond parameters and does not perform external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated against predefined color dictionaries, then used in string formatting functions to produce styled output; no external data flows or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the `system('')` call on Windows, which appears to be a no-op or placeholder; no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility, importing standard modules and external color definitions. It validates color inputs against predefined constants, then formats and outputs styled text. The `system('')` call on Windows is benign, likely a placeholder or environment setup step. No external data fetching, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The minimal security concern stems from the `system('')` call, which is harmless but could be considered unnecessary. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the `system('')` call on Windows, which is harmless. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the negligible risk associated with the no-op system call.",
