{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for payment responses, asset accounts, and agent details in a cryptocurrency-related application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data fields are defined as model attributes with default or required values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, such as network or file operations, are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data models establish data structures but do not implement data flow logic; no source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The 'object' fields are set as default string constants, which is normal. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or insecure handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Pydantic models for representing payment responses, asset accounts, and agent details. It uses standard practices like type annotations, default values, and descriptive fields. No external inputs are read directly; the code primarily models data structures without any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive logic. The default 'object' fields as string literals are typical for identifying object types. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of optional fields and validation constraints suggests adherence to good data validation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data modeling module with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and intended solely for structuring data within a larger application context.",
