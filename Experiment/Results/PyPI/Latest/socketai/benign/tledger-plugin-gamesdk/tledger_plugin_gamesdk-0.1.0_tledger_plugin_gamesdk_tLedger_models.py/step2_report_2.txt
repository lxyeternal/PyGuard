  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No issues detected; code only defines data schemas with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard data models with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.95 — the report suggests a very high confidence that the code is safe.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard data models with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the default 'object' fields set as string constants, but this is typical for identifying object types.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score seems slightly elevated but still low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; standard data schemas with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard data models, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward schema definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** The only variation is in Report 3, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any security-sensitive operations, a risk score higher than 0.1 seems unwarranted.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data models for a financial/crypto application.\n- No external data handling, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- The use of default string constants for 'object' fields is standard and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- The risk scores should remain low, around 0.0 to 0.1, as the code is benign.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Should remain at or near 0.0–0.1; no significant security risk identified.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a standard, well-structured data schema with no security concerns.",
