{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for payment responses, asset accounts, and agent details in a financial/crypto application.",
  "sources": "Data fields such as 'id', 'status', 'payment_amount', 'transaction_hash', 'wallet_address', and timestamp fields; no external data input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only validates and structures data without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal validation; no external data flow or network activity present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward schema definitions with standard field annotations and default values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic and SQLModel data models with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. Fields are properly validated with constraints, and default string constants are typical for object type identifiers. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The models serve as data schemas within a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
