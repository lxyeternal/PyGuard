{
  "purpose": "Define data models for payment, asset accounts, and agent details using Pydantic and SQLModel.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as API requests or databases to instantiate the models.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; data models themselves do not perform data sinks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model instantiation; no direct flows from source to sink as no processing or external calls are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard data modeling with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of Pydantic data models for structured data validation and serialization. It includes fields with descriptive constraints, such as non-negative amounts, optional transaction hashes, and maximum string lengths. No external input handling beyond model instantiation is present, nor are there any system calls, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward, conventional data schema definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for a payment system and agent management. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The models rely on validated data inputs without performing unsafe operations or exposing sensitive data.",
