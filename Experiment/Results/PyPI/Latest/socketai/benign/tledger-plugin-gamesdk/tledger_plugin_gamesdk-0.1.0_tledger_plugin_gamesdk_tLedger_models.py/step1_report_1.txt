  "purpose": "Defines data models for payment responses, asset accounts, and agent details for a financial application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines data structures and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted by this code itself.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as the code only declares schemas without processing or external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard data modeling with pydantic and sqlmodel, focusing on schema validation for payment and account data. It uses descriptive fields and type annotations, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or secret communication channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured data schema definition without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious code, external data interactions, or indicators of malware.",
