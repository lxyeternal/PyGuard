  "purpose": "Define data models for payment responses, asset accounts, and agent details in a crypto-related application.",
  "sources": "Input data for models via Field(...) definitions and default values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into model instances via field assignments; no external data flows are explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or unusual code behaviors are present. The use of optional transaction hash is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Pydantic and SQLModel data models defining structure and validation for payment, account, and agent data. Fields include descriptive metadata, data validation constraints, and default values. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. No network operations, code execution, or other malicious activities are embedded. The code appears to be standard data modeling with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data model definitions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be used for structuring payment and account data in a crypto application.",
