The main security issue is the printing of sensitive data, which should be mitigated in production environments. The malware and obfuscation scores are accurate; the security risk score should be around 0.2-0.3 due to data exposure. No evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack is present."

Obfuscation and dynamic execution are primary concerns, but lacking concrete malicious payloads, the malware scores remain moderate. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring and further analysis are recommended if more code details become available."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to minor coding issues. The overall security posture is low risk, and scores are consistent with the analysis."
