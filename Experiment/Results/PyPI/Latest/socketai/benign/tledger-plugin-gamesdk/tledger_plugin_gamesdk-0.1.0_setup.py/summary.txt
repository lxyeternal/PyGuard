  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for blockchain project management with no malicious activity. The main security issue is the printing of sensitive data, which should be mitigated in production environments. The malware and obfuscation scores are accurate; the security risk score should be around 0.2-0.3 due to data exposure. No evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack is present."
