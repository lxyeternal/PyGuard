  "obfuscated": 0.65,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with their descriptions. Obfuscation and dynamic execution are primary concerns, but lacking concrete malicious payloads, the malware scores remain moderate. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring and further analysis are recommended if more code details become available."
