  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, external modules, data reads, and potential data sinks.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to network transmission, file modification, or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network connections or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard data processing with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code reads from environment variables and external modules but does not perform any network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The absence of obfuscation and malicious indicators suggests a benign purpose. The source-to-sink flow is typical for data handling scripts, with no anomalies detected. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assessment aligns with the observed code characteristics.",
