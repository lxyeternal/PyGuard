{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly interact with external systems or resources, though the exact intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules or APIs. Specific source points include reading environment variables and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data output functions, but specific sinks are not explicitly clear from the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions, potentially reaching external systems or output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected. No suspicious code structures or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is standard, importing modules, defining functions, and processing data. There is no evidence of suspicious or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The absence of hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code reduces concern. Without specific external calls or network activity shown, the risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems typical of a standard Python script with no malicious intent observed.",
