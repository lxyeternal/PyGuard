  "purpose": "Convert a given string to uppercase after validating the input type.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the function 'to_uppercase'.",
  "sinks": "The return statement 'text.upper()' which processes the input string.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is validated, then processed with 'upper()' method, and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward string validation and transformation without hidden or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is a string, raises an error if not, and returns the uppercase version of the input string. The code is simple and does not include external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The main program calls this function with a string literal 'appu' and prints the result. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility function for string transformation with proper validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It appears safe and intended solely for string manipulation.",
