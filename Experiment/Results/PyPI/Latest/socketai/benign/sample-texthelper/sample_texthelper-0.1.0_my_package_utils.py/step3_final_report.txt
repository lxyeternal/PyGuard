  "purpose": "A simple utility function to convert input text to uppercase with input validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' received by the function 'to_uppercase'.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the uppercase string; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the function parameter through validation to the return statement, with no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that checks if the input is a string, raises an error if not, and returns the uppercase version. The invocation with 'appu' and printing the output is benign. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, with proper input validation and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's behavior is consistent with a harmless string utility, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward string transformation utility with proper validation. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the safe nature of the code. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the security risk is negligible.",
