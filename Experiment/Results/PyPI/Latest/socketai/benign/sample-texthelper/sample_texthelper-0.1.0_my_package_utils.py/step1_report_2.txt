  "purpose": "The function converts a given string input to uppercase.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' is provided when the function is called, and the 'print' statement outputs the result.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'to_uppercase' function is printed to the console; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is received from the function argument, validated, converted to uppercase, and then printed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward string transformation with proper input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function to convert input to uppercase, validating that the input is a string. It raises an error if not, then outputs the uppercase version. The code executes a test call with a static string 'appu' and prints the result. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic string transformation utility with proper input validation and no malicious or security concerns.",
