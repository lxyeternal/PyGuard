  "purpose": "Convert a given string to uppercase after validating its type.",

  "sinks": "Return statement; print function outputs the result.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> type check -> uppercase conversion -> return -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward string transformation with type validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that checks if the input is a string and converts it to uppercase. It raises an error if input is not a string. The function is called with a string argument 'appu', and the output is printed. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is simple and self-contained with no external dependencies or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string manipulation with proper input validation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
