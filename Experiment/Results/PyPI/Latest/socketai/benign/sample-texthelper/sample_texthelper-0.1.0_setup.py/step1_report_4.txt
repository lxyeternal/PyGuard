  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sample_texthelper'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no execution of untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into setup() configuration, which defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module, which is a standard Python package used for defining package metadata and installation instructions. The setup() function is called with straightforward arguments: package name, version, packages list (found automatically), no extra dependencies, author info, and a description. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated elements. The code is typical for a Python package setup script and contains no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and benign.",
