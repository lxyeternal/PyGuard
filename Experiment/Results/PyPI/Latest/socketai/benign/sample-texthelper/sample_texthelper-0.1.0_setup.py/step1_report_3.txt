{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sample_texthelper'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author, description, and dependencies via the setuptools.setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the setup configuration uses only static values for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior, are present in this configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata for packaging. It contains no code execution, no dynamic data handling, and no external input/output mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script used for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely defines package metadata without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
