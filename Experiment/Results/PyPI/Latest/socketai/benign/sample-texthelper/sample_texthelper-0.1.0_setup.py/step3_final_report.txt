  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static import of setuptools, static package metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, network calls, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks due to static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static setup script with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script importing 'setuptools' and calling 'setup()' with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, external input, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature eliminate concerns of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All analyses and reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
