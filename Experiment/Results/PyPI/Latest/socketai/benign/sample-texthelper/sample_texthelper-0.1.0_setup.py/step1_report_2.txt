{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'sample_texthelper'.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the import statement from setuptools and the setup() function call with its parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() parameters such as name, version, author, description, and packages are used for package metadata and do not lead to untrusted data flow or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or execution of untrusted code. The code simply configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard setup script without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code serves a straightforward purpose of package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
