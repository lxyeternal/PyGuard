{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'jwt_manager'. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and configures package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and classifiers. It does not process external data or execute runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Reads the local file 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setup() -> no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools. It reads a local README file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic inputs, external data processing, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign with high confidence. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's static and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
