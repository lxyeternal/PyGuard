  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup script for a Python package named 'jwt_manager'.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description and calls `setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- No dynamic input handling, no external data processing, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is straightforward and follows typical packaging patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is a standard setup script with no issues or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** All reports agree that no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- **Logic flaws or mistakes:** None are evident; the code is correct and standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- Since the code is purely for package setup, reading a local README, and specifying static metadata and dependencies, there is no reason to assign any risk scores above 0.\n- The consistent agreement across all reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe provided setup script is a typical, safe Python packaging configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All evidence points to a benign package setup process, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
