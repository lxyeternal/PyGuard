  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the jwt_manager Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leakage or external data manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content as long_description, then passes configuration data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py packaging pattern observed, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local markdown file for project description, then uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. The install_requires specifies the 'PyJWT' library, which is standard for JWT handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard practices without any anomalies or malicious indicators.",
