  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'jwt_manager' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static setup() call with package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script is static and does not process external input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The code is a standard setup configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local 'README.md' file to obtain long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no suspicious behavior detected. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to package the software with appropriate metadata and dependencies.",
