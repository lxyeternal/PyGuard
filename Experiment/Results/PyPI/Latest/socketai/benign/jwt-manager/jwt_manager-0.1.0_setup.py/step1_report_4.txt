  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package named 'jwt_manager' that provides JWT utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; imports 'setuptools' modules for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks present; no untrusted data output or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into 'long_description' variable, then uses 'setup()' with static parameters; no dynamic data flows or external input handling beyond reading the README file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file for long description, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and other setup parameters. It uses static, well-known functions and patterns with no suspicious behaviors or code injection points. The only file read is a static README file, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The package appears legitimate and safe for use.",
