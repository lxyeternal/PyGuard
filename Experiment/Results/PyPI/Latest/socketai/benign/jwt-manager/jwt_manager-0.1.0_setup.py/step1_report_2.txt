  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'jwt_manager' Python package, facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks involved; setup configurations are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reads local files to assemble package metadata; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments present. Usage of standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for documentation and specifies dependencies. There are no dynamic or external inputs that could be exploited. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The package dependencies are standard, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, following standard package configuration practices. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
