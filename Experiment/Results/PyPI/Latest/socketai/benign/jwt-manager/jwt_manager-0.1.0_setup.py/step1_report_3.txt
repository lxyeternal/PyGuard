{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'jwt_manager' with metadata, dependencies, and configuration details for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, defining package metadata and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output beyond static configuration and file reading",
  "flows": "The code reads a file for description and passes static metadata and dependencies to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, and no code execution beyond package setup. The dependencies and URLs are explicit and do not suggest malicious intent. No unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script for 'jwt_manager' with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
