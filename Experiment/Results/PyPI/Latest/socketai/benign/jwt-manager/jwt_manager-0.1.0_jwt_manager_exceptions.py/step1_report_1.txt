  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token handling errors",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reads present in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output actions present",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurring",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definitions with no suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines three custom exception classes for handling token errors. There are no input/output operations, no external dependencies, no code execution, or data manipulation. The code structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic definition of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger token management system but in isolation, it appears benign.",
