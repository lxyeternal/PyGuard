  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token-related errors in a security or authentication context.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, likely intended for use in token validation workflows. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling in security-related Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define custom exceptions. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
