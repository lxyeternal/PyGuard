  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to token errors.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external dependencies are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is simple class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are present.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a securityRisk of 0, which is justified because the code is purely structural with no security implications.\n   - Malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code is standard for exception handling and does not pose a security threat.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature and the detailed reasoning above.",
