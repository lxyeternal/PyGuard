  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines three custom exception classes for token errors. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external dependencies. The code is straightforward, minimal, and typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:  \n   None of the reports find any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. They all agree that the code appears benign and serves as part of a larger token validation system.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Justification**:  \n   Since the code only defines exception classes with no suspicious or malicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n6. **Consistency & Recommendations**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriately reflect the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent. The code is a standard, harmless snippet defining custom exceptions for token error handling. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security or malicious risk.",
