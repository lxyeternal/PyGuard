{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token-related errors",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares exception classes without input sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows present, as there are only class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, intended for token error handling. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions. The code is minimal and standard for defining custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of custom exceptions for token errors, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
