  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions with no input/output, data processing, or external dependencies. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious behavior. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning. They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, which are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks, the risk scores should remain at 0. The same applies to malware scores, which are also 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as part of a larger system but note that in isolation, it’s benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the code’s benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk in this isolated snippet)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard set of custom exception class definitions for token error handling. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
