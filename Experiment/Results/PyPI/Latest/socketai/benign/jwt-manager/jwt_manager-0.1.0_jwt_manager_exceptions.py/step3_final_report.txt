  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token-related errors in a token handling system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for InvalidTokenError, ExpiredTokenError, SignatureVerificationError",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external dependencies, or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are used as exception types, not executing logic or data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard class definitions with no suspicious features",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions, serving as error indicators for token validation processes. There are no input or output operations, data processing, or external dependencies. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to common Python practices for defining exceptions. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose as part of a larger token management system. The absence of suspicious patterns or malicious behavior indicates a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes for token errors, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk.",
