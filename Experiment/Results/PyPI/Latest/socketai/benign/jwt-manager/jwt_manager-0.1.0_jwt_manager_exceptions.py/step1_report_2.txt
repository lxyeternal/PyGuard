  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data reads; exception class definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output effects",
  "flows": "No data flow; just class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class declarations, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with no data processing, input handling, or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. It appears to be standard practice for error handling in token validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
