  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for exceptions.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or malicious code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign class definitions with no malicious intent, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would imply potential security concerns or malicious behavior, which is not supported by the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely structural.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The code is straightforward and serves a common purpose in exception handling for token validation. There are no security concerns or malicious indicators to justify any higher scores.",
