  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to token validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; classes are only defining exception types.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic flow; solely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, intended to handle specific token-related errors: invalid tokens, expired tokens, and signature verification failures. There are no input sources, data processing, or other logic. The structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard and benign, serving as exception definitions for token error handling. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
