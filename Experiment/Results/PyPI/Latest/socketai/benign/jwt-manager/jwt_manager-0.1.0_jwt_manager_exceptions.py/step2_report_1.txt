  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or external dependencies.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n   - The code appears benign and standard for defining error classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is non-malicious, this is justified.\n   - No higher risk scores are warranted here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations and are well-supported.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Based on this analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- These scores reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is purely structural, serving as part of a larger token handling system, with no malicious or security concerns evident. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate.",
