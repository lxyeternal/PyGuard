  "purpose": "Importing classes and exceptions related to JWT management and token validation",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading occurs in this snippet",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identifiable within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules related to JWT management and exception handling. There is no active code, data processing, or logic that could introduce security risks. The imported modules may contain security-sensitive code, but this snippet itself does not perform any operations or handle data.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and only imports components necessary for JWT handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident based on this snippet alone.",
