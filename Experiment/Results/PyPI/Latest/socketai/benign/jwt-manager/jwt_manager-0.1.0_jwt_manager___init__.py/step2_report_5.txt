  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from internal modules (.jwt_manager and .exceptions).\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, or input/output operations.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues based solely on this snippet.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of import statements.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only imports internal modules without executing any logic, the risk scores should remain very low.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation justifies raising the risk above 0.5.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the limitations of analyzing only import statements.\n   - They do not infer vulnerabilities or malicious intent without further context.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code snippet.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple set of import statements, typical in modular Python projects.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, just because of module dependencies, but no actual risk)\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
