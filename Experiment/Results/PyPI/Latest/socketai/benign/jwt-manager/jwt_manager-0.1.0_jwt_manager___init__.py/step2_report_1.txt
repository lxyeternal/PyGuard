  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of import statements for internal modules related to JWT management and exception handling.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or anomalies are detected.\n\n2. **Accuracy of the Reports:**\n   - The assessments are consistent: the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal risk due to the import-only nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation or complex code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements, the risk scores could arguably be set to 0, as there is no active code that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - However, the reports assign a small security risk (0.1), possibly to account for the fact that these modules, when used, could handle sensitive data like JWT tokens. But this is more about the context of usage rather than the import statements themselves.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the provided code snippet and reports, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The scores seem reasonable, but for maximum accuracy, I would suggest:\n     - Malware score: **0** (confirmed)\n     - Obfuscated score: **0** (confirmed)\n     - Risk score: **0** (since import statements alone do not pose security risks)\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate given the code snippet.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard set of import statements with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No further action required.",
