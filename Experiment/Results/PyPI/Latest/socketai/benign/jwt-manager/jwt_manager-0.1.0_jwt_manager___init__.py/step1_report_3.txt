  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow evident from this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and exceptions from local modules. There are no data processing, input reading, or untrusted data handling shown. The imports appear to be standard for modular code organization. Without additional context, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign and typical for modular Python projects involving JWT management. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
