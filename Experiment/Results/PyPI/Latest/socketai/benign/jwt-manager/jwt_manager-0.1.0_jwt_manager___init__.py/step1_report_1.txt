  "purpose": "Import statements for JWT management and exception handling modules, likely part of a larger authentication or security framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: jwt_manager and exceptions from the same package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to the absence of executable code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements referencing internal modules within a package. No executable logic, data processing, or external inputs are present. Since the code is only importing modules, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behavior. This is a typical setup for a module that relies on imported components for its functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, containing only import statements with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for JWT handling and exception management.",
