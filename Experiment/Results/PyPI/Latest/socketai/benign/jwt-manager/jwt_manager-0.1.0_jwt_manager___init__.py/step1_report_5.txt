  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present in the snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing classes from local modules. It does not process data, read inputs, or execute logic. The imported modules are likely part of a larger authentication or security framework, but the snippet itself shows no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as import statements for JWT management and custom exceptions. There are no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks within this minimal snippet.",
