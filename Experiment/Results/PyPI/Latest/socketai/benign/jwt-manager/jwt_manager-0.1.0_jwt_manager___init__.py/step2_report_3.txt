  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .jwt_manager import JWTManager\nfrom .exceptions import InvalidTokenError, ExpiredTokenError, SignatureVerificationError\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code only contains import statements for modules within the same package.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard for modular Python projects, and contains no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**1-5 Reports Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements.\n- They conclude the code is benign with high confidence (0.9-1.0).\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent are detected.\n\n**Assessment of the reasoning:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no vulnerabilities or malicious activity can be inferred solely from import statements.\n- The reports do not overstate or assume vulnerabilities without evidence.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis and Justification:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.  \n- Import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent unless combined with other suspicious behaviors, which are not present here.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- The risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1).  \n- Given the code is just importing modules, this is appropriate.  \n- If the larger codebase contains malicious modules, that risk isn't reflected here, but based on this snippet alone, the low score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No overestimation of risk or malware potential.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable as a minimal default for modules that are part of security frameworks)\n\n**Overall, the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward import of internal modules related to JWT management and exception handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is indicated by this snippet. The scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0, but 0.1 is acceptable)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
