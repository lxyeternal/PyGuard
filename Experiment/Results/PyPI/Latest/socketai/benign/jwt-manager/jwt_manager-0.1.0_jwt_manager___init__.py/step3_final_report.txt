  "purpose": "This code imports internal modules related to JWT management and exception handling, serving as part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.jwt_manager and .exceptions).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only imports modules without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, with no executable logic, data processing, or external input handling. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet, with high confidence levels. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the context. The code is standard for modular Python projects and does not pose security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only import statements with no malicious or security issues. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
