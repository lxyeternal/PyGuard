{
  "purpose": "This code manages JWT token creation, validation, and refresh operations for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Inputs include the 'payload' dictionary, 'token' string, 'secret' string, and optional parameters like 'expiry_minutes' and 'algorithm'.",
  "sinks": "Tokens are encoded and decoded using the jwt library; error handling raises custom exceptions. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions; decoded payload is used for token refresh; errors are caught and handled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. Logging appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT operations with appropriate error handling. It uses 'jwt' library for encoding/decoding tokens, updating 'exp' claim as needed. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The refresh method disables expiry verification temporarily, which is standard practice for token renewal, not malicious. The code appears to be a typical implementation for JWT handling without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module securely manages JWT tokens with proper error handling and no evidence of malicious behavior. No signs of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
