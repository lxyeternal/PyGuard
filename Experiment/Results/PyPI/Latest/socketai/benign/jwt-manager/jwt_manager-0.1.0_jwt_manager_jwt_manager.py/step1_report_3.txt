{
  "purpose": "This code manages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for creating, validating, and refreshing tokens.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: payload, secret, token, algorithms, additional_minutes",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions, which process tokens using secrets and algorithms",
  "flows": "Input data (payload, tokens) are processed through encode/decode functions, leading to token generation or validation results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious code structures. Usage of standard jwt library functions is typical. No obfuscated code observed. No network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the jwt library for token operations, with standard practices for setting expiration and validation. Error handling raises custom exceptions. No signs of malicious intent such as data leakage, secret exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward JWT utility implementation, with proper exception handling and logging. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard JWT management utility without signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and appears safe for use.",
