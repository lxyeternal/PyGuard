{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to create, validate, and refresh JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'payload' for token creation, 'token' and 'secret' for validation and refresh, and 'algorithm' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include jwt.encode() and jwt.decode() functions which process the payload and secrets, and logging statements.",
  "flows": "Input payload and secret data flow into jwt.encode() during token creation and jwt.decode() during validation and refresh; decoded payload is manipulated to update expiration times.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual dynamic code execution; no suspicious or malicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard JWT handling practices, using secure libraries and proper exception handling. No evidence of backdoors, malicious data leaks, or suspicious behavior. Logging is appropriately used without exposing secrets. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard JWT management functions securely, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It relies on established libraries and proper error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
