{
  "purpose": "This code manages JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication, including creating, validating, and refreshing tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: payload, token, secret, expiry_minutes, additional_minutes, algorithm.",
  "sinks": "Uses jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions which process token strings, potentially involving secret keys; logs information messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into jwt.encode/jwt.decode, with secret keys being used in token creation, validation, and refresh processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses jwt library functions for token management. It properly handles exceptions specific to JWT errors, such as expiration and invalid signatures. No evidence of malicious payload manipulation, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The logging is standard and does not leak sensitive info. The token refresh method disables expiration verification temporarily for renewal, which is standard practice. All operations seem intended for standard JWT management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard JWT utility for creating, validating, and refreshing tokens with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It follows expected cryptographic handling practices.",
