{
  "purpose": "Provides JWT creation, validation, and refresh functionalities for secure token management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: payload, secret, token strings, and optional algorithm and expiry settings.",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions handling token generation and validation; exceptions raised on invalid tokens.",
  "flows": "Input data (payload, token) flows into jwt.encode/decode; errors may trigger exception handling; refresh function decodes old token, updates expiry, and re-encodes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The refresh method disables expiration verification temporarily, which is standard but could be misused if improperly secured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT handling with proper error management and no signs of malicious behavior. The use of jwt library functions is appropriate. The refresh method's disabling of expiry verification is common but warrants proper access controls. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The exception handling and logging are standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-implemented JWT utility with no malicious or suspicious components. The low risk and malware scores are justified. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Overall, it is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
