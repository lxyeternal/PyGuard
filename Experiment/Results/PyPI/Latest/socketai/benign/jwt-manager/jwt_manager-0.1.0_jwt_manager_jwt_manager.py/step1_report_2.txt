{
  "purpose": "This code manages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) by creating, validating, and refreshing tokens for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters: payload, token, secret, algorithms, and expiry_minutes.",
  "sinks": "Uses jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions for cryptographic operations, relies on secrets and tokens, which if compromised could lead to token forgery or impersonation.",
  "flows": "Input data (payload, tokens) flows into jwt.encode and jwt.decode functions, which process the data with secrets; validation and refresh flows involve decoding tokens and generating new ones with updated expiration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; code uses standard jwt library functions properly. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. Logging is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses jwt library functions to create, validate, and refresh tokens, handling errors explicitly. No hardcoded secrets are present; secrets are passed as parameters, reducing risk. The token creation includes expiration management, and validation checks signature and expiry. Refresh function disables expiry verification temporarily, which is standard practice for token renewal. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and correctly implements JWT token management without any malicious intent. It follows standard security practices for handling tokens, with proper error handling and logging. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
