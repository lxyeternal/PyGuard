  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code performs standard JWT creation, validation, and refresh operations using the jwt library. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The code properly manages expiration, signature verification, and error handling.\n- **Scores:**\n  - *Malware:* 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n  - *Risk:* 0.2 — low, given the code's standard nature.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical JWT utility with correct practices.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None evident. Proper handling of token expiration and signature verification.\n- **Scores:**\n  - *Malware:* 0 — no malicious activity.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0.\n  - *Risk:* 0.1 — very low.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusions are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, standard JWT management code with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found.\n- **Scores:**\n  - *Malware:* 0.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0.\n  - *Risk:* 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard JWT code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - *Malware:* 0.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0.\n  - *Risk:* 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:**\n  - *Malware:* 0.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0.\n  - *Risk:* 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's standard, well-structured implementation.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is a typical JWT utility with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard security practices.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.",
