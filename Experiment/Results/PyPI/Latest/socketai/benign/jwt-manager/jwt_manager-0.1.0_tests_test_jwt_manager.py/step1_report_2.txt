  "purpose": "Unit testing the JWTManager module for token creation, validation, expiration, and refresh functionalities.",
  "sources": "Constants (SECRET), function inputs (payloads, tokens), imported modules (pytest, time, jwt_manager).",
  "sinks": "JWTManager methods that generate or validate tokens, which could be manipulated if the implementation is insecure.",
  "flows": "Creating tokens with SECRET, validating tokens, refreshing tokens, and handling expiration errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets are present but typical for testing purposes, no malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit tests for JWT token operations. It uses a hardcoded secret, which is typical in testing environments but should be managed securely in production. No external input handling, no data exfiltration, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code relies on the JWTManager for cryptographic operations, which is presumed to be a standard library. No anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for JWT token handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of a hardcoded secret is acceptable within testing contexts but should be avoided in production. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for testing the functionality of the JWTManager module.",
