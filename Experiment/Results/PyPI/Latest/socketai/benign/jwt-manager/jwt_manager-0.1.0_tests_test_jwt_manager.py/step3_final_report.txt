{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for JWTManager module, verifying token creation, validation, expiration, and refresh functionalities.",
  "sources": "Static secret key 'test_secret_key' used within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Token creation functions receive payloads and secrets; validation and refresh functions process tokens and secrets; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded secret in testing environment; use of time.sleep() for expiration testing, which is standard but could be optimized.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of pytest unit tests for JWT operations. It uses a static secret, typical for testing, with no obfuscated or malicious code. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The static secret's use is acceptable in this context, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform any harmful actions, and the test logic is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of JWT unit tests with no malicious intent or security risks. The static secret is acceptable for testing purposes but should be managed securely in production. Overall, there is no supply chain or malicious activity risk.",
