  "purpose": "Unit tests for JWT token creation, validation, expiration, and refresh functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads hardcoded secret 'test_secret_key' and input payloads for tokens.",
  "sinks": "Uses JWTManager methods for creating, validating, and refreshing tokens; relies on external JWT library behavior.",
  "flows": "Input payloads and secret -> JWTManager methods -> token generation/validation -> assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded secret within the test; no insecure data handling or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying JWT token operations. It relies on a secret key hardcoded as a constant, which is acceptable within testing contexts but could be considered a static secret in production. The tests involve creating, validating, and refreshing tokens, with no external data inputs or suspicious code patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any network operations or system modifications, and it interacts solely with the JWTManager class and the JWT library. Overall, the code appears to be standard testing code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for JWT token operations with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It uses a static secret for testing purposes and focuses on validating token lifecycle management.",
