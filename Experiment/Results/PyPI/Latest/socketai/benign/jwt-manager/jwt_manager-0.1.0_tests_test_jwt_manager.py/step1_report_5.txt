  "sources": "Constants (SECRET), input parameters to create_token and validate_token methods, payload data.",
  "sinks": "JWTManager methods that generate or validate tokens, potential exception handling for expired tokens.",
  "flows": "Payload data -> create_token -> token string -> validate_token -> decoded payload; Exception handling flow for expired tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded secret key ('test_secret_key'), which is typical in test environments but not secure for production. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists of unit tests for a JWT management system. It employs hardcoded secrets suitable for testing but not production. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The functions tested (create_token, validate_token, refresh_token) are standard JWT operations. No suspicious data flow or anomalies are present. The code's purpose is clearly for testing, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for JWT token management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of a hardcoded secret is acceptable in a test context but should be handled securely in production. Overall, the code is benign with no malicious intent.",
