  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, as indicated by the functions and variable names.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the console, logs, or files; potentially sends data over network connections if network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks such as output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. No suspicious domain or network activity identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to follow standard programming practices. It reads input from typical sources, processes data with common functions, and outputs results. No signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or cryptomining are evident. No insecure use of environment variables or SQL injections found. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or confusing constructs. Overall, it seems to be a benign utility or application code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard and safe for use. No anomalies or suspicious behavior were detected during review.",
