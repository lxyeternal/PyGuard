{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using setuptools, serving as a standard setup script with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static and contains no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' are unprofessional and potentially malicious in intent, but are metadata concerns only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py configuration with static package metadata. No obfuscation, dynamic code, or malicious payloads are present. The suspicious contact info and URL do not impact code security but could be used for social engineering or reputation damage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2 due to metadata concerns. These scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the metadata anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign from a technical security perspective, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern lies in unprofessional contact details, which should be verified outside of code analysis. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment.",
