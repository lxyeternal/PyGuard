  "purpose": "Obfuscate and deobfuscate tokens using character replacements to hide sensitive information.",
  "sources": "The token variable in main() which is input to the encrypt() method.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the encrypted token; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Token string is passed from main() to encrypt() for obfuscation, then outputted via print().",
  "anomalies": "The code performs character replacement-based obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident beyond the token itself. No data leakage or external communications are present. The token appears to be a typical authentication token, but its content is not evaluated here.",
  "analysis": "The TokenCryptor class provides simple character replacement encryption and decryption, serving as a form of obfuscation rather than security. The token in main() is a hardcoded string that resembles an authentication token, but it is not used in any malicious context within this code. The encryption and decryption methods are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection. The only notable aspect is the obfuscation of the token for concealment, which is not inherently malicious. There are no external data sources or sinks, and the code performs purely local character transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic obfuscation mechanism with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials (beyond the token, which appears to be a placeholder), or security vulnerabilities. The design is simple and solely for encoding/decoding tokens. Overall, it poses no security threat or malicious activity.",
