  "purpose": "Import the 'hvcc_teensy' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sinks": "The import itself is not a sink; potential issues could arise if 'hvcc_teensy' is used maliciously later, but this code snippet does not show usage.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local module 'main' to the current namespace via import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement, importing 'hvcc_teensy' from a local module 'main'. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. Since this is a minimal import, it does not directly indicate malicious behavior. However, without context of how 'hvcc_teensy' is used later, potential malicious activity cannot be fully ruled out, but from this code alone, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no visible malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard Python code for importing a module component. No malware or security issues are apparent from this snippet.",
