{
  "purpose": "Import of hvcc_teensy from a local module main.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python import statement importing hvcc_teensy from a local module main. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent; any risk depends on the content of hvcc_teensy or main, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. The only minor concern is a slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) in one report, which is unwarranted given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the import as safe, and the scores should reflect this. The minimal security risk score (0.1) should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat based solely on this snippet.",
