  "purpose": "Importing the 'hvcc_teensy' component or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement which reads a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports a module without executing untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and the import statement itself is standard. No unusual patterns or secrets are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of 'hvcc_teensy' from a local module 'main'. This is a common Python practice for modular code organization. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors. The snippet alone does not provide context for malicious intent. It simply indicates dependency inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import statement with no anomalies.",
