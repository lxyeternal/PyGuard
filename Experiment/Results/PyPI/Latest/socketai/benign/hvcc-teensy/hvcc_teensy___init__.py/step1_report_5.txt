  "purpose": "Import the 'hvcc_teensy' component from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module './main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement in Python, importing 'hvcc_teensy' from a sibling module 'main'. It contains no data handling, input, or output operations, nor any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network activity. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Its simplicity suggests standard module import behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic import of a local module component with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical part of a larger, benign project.",
