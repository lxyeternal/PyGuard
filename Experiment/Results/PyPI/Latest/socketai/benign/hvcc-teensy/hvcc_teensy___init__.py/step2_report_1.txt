  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .main import hvcc_teensy`.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python syntax, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The only potential concern is whether 'hvcc_teensy' or 'main' could be malicious, but from the code snippet alone, this cannot be established.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself is benign; no issues are present in the code snippet.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly noting the simplicity and benign nature of the import.\n- They do not overstate potential risks, and their conclusions are appropriate given the code.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** Most are zero, with one report giving 0.1, which is still very low and acceptable considering the context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities that warrant a high risk score.\n- The only slight concern is potential misuse if 'hvcc_teensy' is malicious, but the code snippet alone does not support this.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the import alone is not suspicious.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. The minimal, benign nature of the code justifies low scores across the board.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\nGiven all this, I would **adjust the overall scores** to reflect the benign nature:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary; the overall security assessment should remain very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and poses no security risk based on the provided snippet.",
