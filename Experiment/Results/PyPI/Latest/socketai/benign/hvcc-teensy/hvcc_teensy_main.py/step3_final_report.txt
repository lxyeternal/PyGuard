{
  "purpose": "The code generates C header files for Teensy Audio DSP projects using templates, copying static files, and incorporating external metadata for macro definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads external parameters (externs.parameters.inParam), external metadata (patch_meta.external), and static files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input into dangerous operations or output untrusted data beyond macro definitions.",
  "flows": "External metadata influences macro definitions; no data flows into network or system commands; template rendering uses trusted parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external metadata without validation, which could influence macro definitions but does not execute code or introduce malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script performs directory cleanup, copies static and source files, and renders templates with parameters. External metadata may influence macro definitions but is not executed. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Error handling is minimal but standard for such utilities. The code's operations are typical for code generation tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe code generator utility with no malicious intent. External metadata influence is minimal and controlled. The security risk is low, and there are no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
