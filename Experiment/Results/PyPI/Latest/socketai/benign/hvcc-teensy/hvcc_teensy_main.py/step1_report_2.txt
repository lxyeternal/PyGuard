{
  "purpose": "The code generates a Teensy Audio DSP header file and related build files from templates, integrating external metadata and copying static files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'externs.parameters.inParam', 'patch_meta.external', environment variables, and template files. Data is read from filesystem, environment, and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated header file 'HeavyTeensy.h' into output directory, copies static header file, and potentially writes a Makefile (commented out).",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Metadata and external info -> Templating engine -> Generated header file and static copies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external metadata 'external_meta.get(\"OPENAUDIO\")' could inject code or define directives; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The code loads templates dynamically but does not execute untrusted code beyond template rendering.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem operations, including directory removal and copying, and uses Jinja2 for templating. The only dynamic content injected into templates is data from parameters and external metadata, which appear controlled. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The static file copying is straightforward. The commented-out Makefile generation does not execute. The process does not involve network activity or system compromise. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate code generator with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard template-based code generator for embedded audio projects. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and appears safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
