  "purpose": "Generate a Teensy Audio DSP object by copying source files, static files, and rendering templates based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (externs, patch_name, patch_meta, channels, copyright, verbose), environment variables, file system (template files, static files, output directory), external_meta.get() call.",
  "sinks": "Writing rendered templates to files in output directory.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment data are used to generate and write template-rendered code files into the output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls. Use of environment variables appears safe. File operations are standard, no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file system operations, template rendering, and copying static files. It uses input parameters to customize generated code files. The only external interaction is reading templates and static files, and writing output files. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The function uses exception handling for errors, but nothing indicates malicious intent. External_meta.get() is used cautiously for optional defines, which is safe. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate code generation script for embedded device firmware, with no signs of malicious activity or malware. It performs standard file operations and template rendering based on user inputs. Risks are minimal and typical for such scripts.",
