{
  "purpose": "The code generates Teensy Audio DSP source files and associated static files using templates, copying source code, and managing output directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads input directories for source files and templates, environment variables, and optional external metadata.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated header files (.h) and potentially other files in the output directory.",
  "flows": "Source directories and templates are used to generate files; external metadata may influence defines; files are written to output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses environment-based configurations and dynamic file generation, which is normal for such build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script copies source and static files into a designated output directory, cleans previous outputs, and generates a header file from a Jinja2 template with several parameters, including external metadata influencing defines. It handles exceptions gracefully, returning error info if needed. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a typical code generation script without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and code generation script that creates source files using templates and static files. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal operational considerations.",
