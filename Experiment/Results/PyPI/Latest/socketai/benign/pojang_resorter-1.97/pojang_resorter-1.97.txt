      "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'utilities.py' during installation without validation poses a significant security risk, especially if the script is malicious or tampered with. While the code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, this pattern can be exploited, warranting higher malware and security risk scores. The current scores are reasonable but should be adjusted upward to reflect the potential danger. Best practices recommend validating or removing such post-install scripts to mitigate risks."
