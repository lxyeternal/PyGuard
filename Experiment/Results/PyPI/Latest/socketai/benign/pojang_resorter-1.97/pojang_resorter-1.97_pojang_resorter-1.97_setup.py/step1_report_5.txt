  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including custom post-installation actions to execute an internal script.",
  "sources": "Reads the path to 'utilities.py' within the installed package directory; accesses package metadata and dependencies; executes a script post-install.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'utilities.py' via subprocess after installation; potential for malicious code execution if 'utilities.py' is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "After installation, the custom command runs 'utilities.py' with '--run' argument, which could execute arbitrary code if 'utilities.py' is malicious or modified.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically runs an internal script post-install without explicit user consent; no validation or sandboxing of 'utilities.py'. The code does not verify or sanitize the script before execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after the normal installation process, constructs a path to 'utilities.py' within the installed package directory. If this script exists, it executes it using subprocess.run. This behavior could be malicious if 'utilities.py' has been tampered with, as it runs arbitrary code during installation. The package dependencies and metadata are standard, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious dependencies. The immediate concern is the automatic execution of an internal script, which could potentially perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modifications, or network communication, especially if the package or its environment has been compromised. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present. The overall risk depends on the trustworthiness of the 'utilities.py' script that is executed post-install.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an internal script automatically during package installation, which poses a security risk if that script is malicious or tampered with. This behavior could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system. The package metadata and dependencies are typical and do not indicate malicious intent, but the post-install execution step is a security concern.",
