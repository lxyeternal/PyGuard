  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including custom post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists(), subprocess.run() in PostInstallCommand.run method",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run(['python', exe_path, '--run'], check=True) which executes a script at a specified path",
  "flows": "After installation, the code checks for 'utilities.py' in the package directory and executes it with Python if found",
  "anomalies": "The script runs an external Python script ('utilities.py') during installation without validation or restrictions, which could be exploited if the file is malicious or replaced",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, with a custom installation command that attempts to run a specific script ('utilities.py') post-installation. This behavior can be legitimate if intended, but executing arbitrary scripts during package installation is risky, especially if the script path can be manipulated or replaced. The script checks for the existence of the file and runs it with Python, which could lead to execution of malicious code if an attacker controls or modifies 'utilities.py'. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard and benign. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code is present. However, the post-install script execution is a potential security concern as it could run malicious code silently.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a post-install step that executes a specific script ('utilities.py') within the package directory. This behavior is potentially risky, as it allows code execution during installation without validation. If 'utilities.py' is malicious or compromised, it could execute harmful commands. Overall, the package's code does not contain explicit malicious intent but the automatic execution of an internal script during install presents a security risk.",
