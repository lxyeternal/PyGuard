  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Datasette plugin that integrates Google Analytics tracking script based on plugin configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads plugin metadata configuration, HTTP responses, and HTML content to verify script inclusion.",
  "sinks": "HTML rendering and DOM parsing, no external data sinks or untrusted input outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from plugin metadata into HTML response where scripts are conditionally included based on the tracking ID.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; tests check for script presence based on configuration. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code performs standard testing procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs automated tests for plugin behavior, specifically ensuring Google Analytics scripts are added only when configured. No suspicious patterns, malicious actions, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code operates within typical testing frameworks and does not process untrusted input beyond standard HTML parsing. No backdoors, network communications, or harmful actions are present. The scripts are conditionally included based on plugin configuration, aligning with expected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard unit tests for plugin behavior, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious code. Overall, it appears safe and correctly implemented for its purpose.",
