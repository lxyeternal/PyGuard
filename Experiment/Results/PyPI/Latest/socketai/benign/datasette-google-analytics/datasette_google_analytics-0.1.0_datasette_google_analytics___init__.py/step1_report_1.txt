  "purpose": "The code is a Datasette plugin that extends the Jinja2 environment and adds Google Analytics tracking ID to templates.",
  "sources": "Reads plugin configuration via datasette.plugin_config(\"datasette-google-analytics\")",
  "sinks": "Uses plugin configuration data to inject 'ga_tracking_id' into templates",
  "flows": "Plugin config data -> inner() function -> returned dictionary -> injected into templates",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, adds a custom template directory, and dynamically retrieves plugin configuration data for Google Analytics. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The plugin configuration read is controlled via Datasette's plugin system and only supplies the tracking ID for analytics purposes. No external network connections, data leaks, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Datasette plugin intended to add Google Analytics tracking. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
