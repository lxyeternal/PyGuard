{
  "purpose": "The code is a plugin for Datasette that customizes Jinja2 environment and adds Google Analytics tracking ID to templates.",
  "sources": "Reads plugin configuration via datasette.plugin_config and environment variables for template directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Injects tracking ID into template variables for rendering; no direct data leakage or malicious sink present.",
  "flows": "Plugin configuration data flows from datasette.plugin_config into template variables, used in HTML rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code appears straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses plugin hooks to modify the Jinja2 environment and add tracking info. It dynamically sets the template directory path and asynchronously retrieves plugin config for the tracking ID. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors was found. The only dynamic operation is reading plugin config and setting template variables, which is typical for plugin functionality. The code structure is clear and standard for a Datasette plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Datasette plugin that enhances template rendering with tracking info. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
