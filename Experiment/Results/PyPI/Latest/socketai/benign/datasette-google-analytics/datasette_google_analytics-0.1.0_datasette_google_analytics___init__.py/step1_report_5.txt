  "purpose": "Enhance Jinja2 environment with custom templates and add Google Analytics tracking ID to templates.",
  "sources": "Reads plugin configuration via datasette.plugin_config in inner() function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from plugin_config() to template variables, but not to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; straightforward plugin hooks and environment modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code adds a custom template directory to the Jinja2 environment and asynchronously provides a Google Analytics tracking ID from plugin configuration. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets are present. The use of datasette.plugin_config is standard for plugin configurations. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate plugin for Datasette, intended to modify template environment and inject tracking ID for analytics. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
