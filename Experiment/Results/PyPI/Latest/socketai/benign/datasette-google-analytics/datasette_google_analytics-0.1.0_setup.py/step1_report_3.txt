  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'datasette-google-analytics' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted data; it defines static configuration parameters for packaging.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to files, send data over networks, or execute untrusted code. It only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; the setup script simply declares dependencies and package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools configuration for packaging a Python project. It defines metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The dependencies are common and related to package building and testing. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are used.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
