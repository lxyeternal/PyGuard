  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic data, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- Dependencies are typical for packaging and testing.\n- Entry points and metadata are straightforward.\n- No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and reasonable.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. Given the static, standard nature of the code, this is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is purely declarative, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The dependency list is typical; no suspicious packages are included.\n- Entry points are standard for a plugin setup.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall assessment across all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; the code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.",
