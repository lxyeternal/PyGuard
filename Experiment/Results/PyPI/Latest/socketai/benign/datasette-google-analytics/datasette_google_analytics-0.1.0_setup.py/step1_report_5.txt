  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Datasette plugin package named 'datasette-google-analytics'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for metadata, package lists, and dependency specifications; it does not read external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data or perform network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The setup script is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and dependencies using static values. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The dependencies and entry points are standard for Python packaging. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. All package requirements and configuration details appear legitimate and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign Python packaging configuration for a Datasette plugin. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
