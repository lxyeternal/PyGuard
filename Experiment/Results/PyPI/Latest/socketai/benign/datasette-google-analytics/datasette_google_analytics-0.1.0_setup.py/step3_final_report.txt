{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'datasette-google-analytics', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function, including package name, version, author, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no runtime data leaks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The static configuration data flows from the setup() call into the package build process; no dynamic or external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools for packaging a Python module. It contains only static configuration data, with no dynamic input, external data, or runtime code execution. Dependencies are typical for packaging and testing, and entry points are standard for plugin registration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a typical, safe Python packaging configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
