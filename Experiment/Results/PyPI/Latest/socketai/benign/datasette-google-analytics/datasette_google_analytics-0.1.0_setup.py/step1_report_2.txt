  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'datasette-google-analytics'.",
  "sources": "None; the code only specifies static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, defines static variables, and calls 'setup' with fixed parameters. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are utilized. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
