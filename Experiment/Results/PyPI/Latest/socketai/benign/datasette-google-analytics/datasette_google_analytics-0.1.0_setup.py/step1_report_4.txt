  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for the 'datasette-google-analytics' plugin to be published via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package information, dependencies, and metadata from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of versioning and dependency management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, specifies metadata such as name, description, author, URL, license, version, packages, modules, entry points, and dependencies. The dependencies include 'datasette' and test/build tools, with no indication of malicious or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices. No anomalies or indicators of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard Python package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies for publishing the plugin. Therefore, it poses no security risks.",
