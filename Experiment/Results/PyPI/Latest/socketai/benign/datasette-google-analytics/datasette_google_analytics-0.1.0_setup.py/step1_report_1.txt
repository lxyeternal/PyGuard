{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'datasette-google-analytics', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings for package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include dependency installation and entry points, but none are explicitly unsafe in this context.",
  "flows": "No dynamic input or data flows are present; configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious code structures detected. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without executing any untrusted or malicious code. The dependencies are typical for packaging and testing, and no user input or external data is processed dynamically. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
