      "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, transparent security analysis framework for Python packages. It does not contain malicious code or backdoors. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The moderate risk score accounts for subprocess and external API interactions but does not indicate active malicious behavior. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
