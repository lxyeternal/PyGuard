{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface for analyzing and installing Python packages securely, delegating core security checks to the external SecurePip class.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (requirements files), command-line arguments, package name and version inputs",
  "sinks": "Calls to SecurePip methods for analysis and installation, output to console for reports and errors",
  "flows": "Input data from files and CLI arguments flow into parsing functions, then into SecurePip analysis or installation methods, with results outputted to the console",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that manages package analysis and installation, with standard error handling and recursive requirements parsing. It relies on the external SecurePip class for security assessments, which is not visible here. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The parsing routines and report generation are standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for secure package management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The overall security posture is low risk, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the external SecurePip component.",
