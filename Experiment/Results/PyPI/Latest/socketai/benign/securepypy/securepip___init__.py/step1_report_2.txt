{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a Python package that exports the SecurePip class and a command-line interface main function, likely for a security-related tool.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from relative modules .core and .cli, and the version and all metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only initializes module metadata and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed; minimal code structure with no runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level imports and metadata without executing any runtime logic or handling external data. The import statements are relative, suggesting internal module structure, and do not involve untrusted input. The version and __all__ variables are standard for package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to expose certain components of the package and does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behaviors.",
