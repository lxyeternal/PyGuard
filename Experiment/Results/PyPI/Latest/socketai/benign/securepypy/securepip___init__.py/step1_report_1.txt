{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a Python package, importing core functionality and CLI commands, and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core and .cli), which may contain additional code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; only module imports and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of module imports and setting package metadata such as version and exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The imports suggest modular design, and no external data handling is visible. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file establishing module exports and metadata, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
