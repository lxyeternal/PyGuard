{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports for a Python package, importing components from local modules and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own files (.core and .cli) to import specific classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import from local modules, assign version, and declare public API; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets (beyond version string), or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports internal components, defines version and public API variables. It contains no external data input, no dynamic execution, no network calls, nor any suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard module initialization or entry point setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and serves as a simple setup for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
