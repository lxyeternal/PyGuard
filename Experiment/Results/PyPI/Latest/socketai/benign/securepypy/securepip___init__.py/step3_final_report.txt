{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing internal components and defining package metadata and public API.",
  "sources": "Internal modules .core and .cli imported via relative imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports internal modules, sets version and __all__, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores and assessments are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
