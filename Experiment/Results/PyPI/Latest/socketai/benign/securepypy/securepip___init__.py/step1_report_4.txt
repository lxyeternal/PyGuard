  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only contains imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs module imports and defines package metadata (__version__, __all__). There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or code execution. It appears to be a standard package initialization script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes certain components for external use.",
