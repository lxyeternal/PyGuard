{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point or interface for a Python package, exposing core functionality and command-line interface components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .cli), setting version and exported symbols",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly established; the code only imports modules and defines package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions from internal modules, defines a version string, and specifies exported symbols. There are no dynamic evaluations, network calls, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or main module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
