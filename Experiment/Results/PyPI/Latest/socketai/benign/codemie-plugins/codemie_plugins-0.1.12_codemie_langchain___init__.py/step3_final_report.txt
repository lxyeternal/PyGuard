  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "N/A (no code provided or code is empty/placeholder).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data sources identified).",
  "flows": "N/A (no code to analyze for source-to-sink data flows).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or presence of only placeholder/empty code; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code or benign nature of the provided code snippets. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators. Confidence levels are low where code is missing or minimal, which aligns with the limited information. The reasoning in each report is consistent and reasonable, with no signs of false positives or overlooked issues.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is benign or absent, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores and confidence levels are appropriate and consistent with the provided information. No revisions or further analysis are necessary.",
