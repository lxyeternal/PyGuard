  "purpose": "Set up basic logging configuration for a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code imports the logging module and calls logging.basicConfig() to configure logging level and format.",
  "sinks": "The code creates a logger instance with getLogger(__name__), but does not process external inputs or data flows.",
  "flows": "No external data sources; the code only configures logging, so no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard logging setup and no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard logging configuration: it imports the logging module, sets up basic configuration with level INFO and a timestamped message format, and creates a logger instance. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for application logging. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise given the benign nature. The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty of safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are accurate, but the security risk score could be adjusted to 0 for full accuracy. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
