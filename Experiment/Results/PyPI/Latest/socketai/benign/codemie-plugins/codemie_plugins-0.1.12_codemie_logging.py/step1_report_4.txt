  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward and standard for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and sets up basic configuration with a specified format and level. It then creates a logger instance. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard logging setup without any unusual or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical logging setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply establishes a logging configuration for use in a larger application.",
