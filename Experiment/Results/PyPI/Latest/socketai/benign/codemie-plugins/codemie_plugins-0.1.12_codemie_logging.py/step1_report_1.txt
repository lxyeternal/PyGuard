  "purpose": "Configure and initialize a logger for application logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for logging (level and format).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or output; the logger outputs to standard logging handlers with configured format.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses only standard logging setup with no hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard logging module, sets up a basic configuration with info level and a timestamped message format, then creates a logger instance. It is a straightforward, typical logging setup without any suspicious elements, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. There are no inputs from external sources, no data flows to untrusted destinations, and no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard logger configuration with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It is a typical setup for application logging.",
