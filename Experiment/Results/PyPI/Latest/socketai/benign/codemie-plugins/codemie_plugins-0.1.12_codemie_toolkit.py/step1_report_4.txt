  "purpose": "Defines data models and a toolkit for remote tools, with input sanitization methods to prevent dangerous inputs.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to sanitize_input method, potentially user-provided strings.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls, potential return of ValueError, schema serialization.",
  "flows": "Input string -> sanitize_input method -> pattern matching -> either error logging and return of ValueError or silent pass.",
  "anomalies": "The sanitize_input method returns a ValueError instance instead of raising it, which may lead to improper exception handling. No other suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for tool metadata and input. The core sanitization method checks input against deny and allow patterns. It logs errors if patterns match or do not match, and returns ValueError objects instead of raising exceptions, which is unusual. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The sanitization logic seems intended to block dangerous inputs but may not enforce security properly due to returning ValueError instances rather than raising exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement input sanitization for potentially dangerous inputs, which is a security best practice. However, the method returns ValueError objects instead of raising them, which may lead to insecure handling of malicious inputs. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. Overall, the code has minor security concern in exception handling but no malicious intent.",
