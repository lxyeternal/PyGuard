  "purpose": "Define data models and toolkit classes for remote tool management with input sanitization.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to the sanitize_input method, class attribute values, and pattern lists.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, potential exception raising in sanitize_input, and schema generation in to_dict.",
  "flows": "Input string arg flows into sanitize_input method, which checks against patterns and logs errors or returns exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Sanitize_input method returns a ValueError instead of raising it, which may not be effective for exception handling. No actual harmful code or backdoors identified. Use of regular expressions for sanitization is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with pydantic and tool classes for remote tool integration. The sanitize_input method attempts to prevent dangerous inputs by pattern matching. It logs errors and returns ValueError objects instead of raising exceptions, which could be a design flaw but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Pattern matching approach could be bypassed, but this is a common security pattern rather than malicious code. The code does not connect to external domains, send data, or perform harmful actions. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard security pattern for input sanitization within a tool framework. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior but has a minor design flaw in exception handling. Overall, it is safe and not suspicious.",
