  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of input validation within a tool framework. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary concern is the improper handling of exceptions (returning ValueError objects instead of raising), which is a coding style issue, not a security vulnerability. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score (~0.2) due to design flaws."
