  "purpose": "Provides data models and input sanitization for remote toolkits and tools, validating input patterns.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching in sanitize_input method, reading input strings for validation.",
  "sinks": "Pattern matching results, logging errors, returning ValueError objects.",
  "flows": "Input string -> pattern matching -> logging/error handling -> return ValueError or None.",
  "anomalies": "sanitize_input returns ValueError objects instead of raising exceptions; method lacks @staticmethod decorator despite using 'cls'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models and a sanitization method that checks input against deny and allow patterns. It logs errors and returns ValueError objects when patterns are matched or not matched. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code are present. The main concern is that returning exception objects instead of raising them can lead to improper error handling, but this is a design flaw, not malicious. The method's static context is inconsistent, lacking the @staticmethod decorator. Overall, the code is straightforward, standard for input validation, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The risk score (~0.2) reflects minor issues like pattern matching limitations and exception handling approach, but no active security threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of input validation within a tool framework. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary concern is the improper handling of exceptions (returning ValueError objects instead of raising), which is a coding style issue, not a security vulnerability. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score (~0.2) due to design flaws.",
