  "purpose": "Define data models and a toolkit class for remote tools with pattern-based input validation.",
  "sources": "Reading module imports, class attributes, method parameters, and code logic including pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Logging errors with potential dangerous input detection, returning ValueError exceptions based on pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input strings are checked against denied and allowed regex patterns; errors are logged or exceptions are returned accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The sanitize_input method is a static method but is incorrectly defined with 'cls' parameter without a @staticmethod decorator. It returns ValueError objects directly rather than raising exceptions, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models and pattern validation logic. The pattern matching and logging appear standard for input validation. The method sanitize_input could be improved by adding a @staticmethod decorator to clarify its intent; currently, it uses 'cls' but is not marked static, which is a coding inconsistency but not malicious. There are no external data reads, network calls, or hidden behaviors. The pattern validation aims to prevent dangerous inputs, aligning with security best practices but does not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious intent or malware. It implements pattern-based input validation and data modeling with no suspicious or harmful behavior. The only issue is a minor coding inconsistency in method definition, which does not impact security.",
