  "flows": "sanitize_input processes 'arg' string, checks against patterns, logs errors, and returns exceptions or None.",
  "anomalies": "Sanitization function only logs and returns errors but does not prevent execution or sanitize data; pattern matching may be insufficient for security.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models and a toolkit class for remote tools. The key function, sanitize_input, checks input against deny and allow patterns, logs errors, and returns ValueError on mismatches. However, it does not enforce sanitization beyond logging and exception returning, which may not prevent malicious input processing elsewhere. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity is present. The design appears to be standard but incomplete in secure sanitization enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a data modeling and pattern checking setup. The sanitize_input method provides basic pattern validation and error reporting but lacks active sanitization or enforcement mechanisms. No malicious intent or malware indicators are evident, but the sanitization approach could be insufficient if not integrated properly. Overall security risk appears low, with no active malicious behavior.",
