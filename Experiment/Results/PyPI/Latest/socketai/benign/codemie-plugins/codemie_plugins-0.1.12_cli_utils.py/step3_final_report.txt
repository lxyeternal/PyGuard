  "purpose": "Utility functions for configuration management, banner display, toolkit discovery, module import, and task handling within the CLI environment.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, environment variables, and directory structures; imports modules dynamically based on directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes imported modules; reads and writes JSON configuration files; manages asyncio tasks and shutdown procedures.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are retrieved from environment variables or config files; modules are imported based on directory existence; tasks are canceled and registered for shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Dynamic import pattern is standard but could be exploited if directories are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility module that handles configuration, display, plugin discovery, and task management safely. It employs proper error handling, controlled dynamic imports, and standard libraries. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration are present. The dynamic import pattern, while common in plugin systems, poses a minimal risk if directory contents are tampered with, but this is acknowledged and managed through existence checks and error logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module with no malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified given the controlled use of dynamic imports. The absence of obfuscation and malicious behavior supports a malware score of 0. Overall, the code's security posture is high, with only a minimal, manageable risk associated with plugin directory integrity.",
