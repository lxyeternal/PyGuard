  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes configuration management, display, toolkit discovery, and task handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network or system activity. Dynamic import of modules based on directory structure is common in plugin systems.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the controlled use of dynamic imports.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others; emphasizes configuration, module import, and task management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious secrets or obfuscated code. Dynamic import based on directory structure is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. The risk score of 0.2 aligns with the findings.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with emphasis on safe practices.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No unusual patterns; uses standard libraries; safe error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or signs of sabotage. Malware score 0 is correct.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and thorough. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on configuration, module discovery, and task management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; dynamic import is controlled; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; risk score 0.2 is justified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct reasoning; no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions; emphasizes safeguards.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; dynamic import is guarded; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the analysis confirms no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied, but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the controlled use of dynamic imports and configuration handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard utility functions for CLI operations.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration.\n- Dynamic module loading is a common pattern in plugin systems and is properly guarded.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal risk due to dynamic imports, but within normal plugin system patterns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the overall assessment indicates the code is safe and free from malware or malicious intent.",
