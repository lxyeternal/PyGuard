{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing configuration, displaying banners, discovering toolkits, and handling async tasks in the CodeMie Plugins CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads from configuration files (config.json, pyproject.toml), environment variables, filesystem directories, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables, reads files (including pyproject.toml), dynamically imports modules, and cancels asyncio tasks.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration from files/env vars, discovers toolkit directories, imports modules for toolkits, cancels asyncio tasks, and registers objects for shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and methods; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions such as banner display, configuration management, toolkit discovery, module importation, and task cancellation. It reads config data securely, uses environment variables as a first priority, and safely handles file I/O. The module imports third-party libraries like pyfiglet and rich, which are common for CLI UI enhancements. It includes exception handling, avoiding crashes, and does not perform any suspicious network operations or data exfiltration. The functions for managing asyncio tasks and registering shutdown hooks are implemented with safe practices. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or secret exfiltration mechanisms. All file and module operations are controlled and follow standard patterns, and no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for CLI operations, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators. Overall, it is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
