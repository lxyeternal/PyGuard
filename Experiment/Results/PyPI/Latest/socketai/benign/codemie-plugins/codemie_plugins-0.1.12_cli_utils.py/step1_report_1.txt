  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for the CodeMie Plugins CLI, including configuration management, toolkit discovery, display helpers, and task handling.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (config.json, pyproject.toml), environment variables, and filesystem directories for toolkits.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to configuration files, reads environment variables, and imports modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Reads config or environment variables -> potentially loads modules or writes config files -> manages async tasks or registers objects for shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import of modules based on directory structure, which can be exploited if directory contents are manipulated. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings are present. No network activity or system modifications are detected. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration files, displays banners, discovers toolkits, and handles asyncio tasks and process shutdown registration. The dynamic import mechanism could potentially be abused if malicious directories or modules are introduced into the 'toolkits' directory, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage. The code uses safe practices like exception handling around file IO and import operations. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The module operates within its intended scope, and all external interactions are controlled and explicit.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious intent. The dynamic module import could pose a risk if the 'toolkits' directory is compromised, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. Overall, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
