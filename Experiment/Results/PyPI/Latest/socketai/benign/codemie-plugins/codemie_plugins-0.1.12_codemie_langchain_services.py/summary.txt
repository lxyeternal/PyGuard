  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a message-driven tool executor. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk are evident. The primary concern is trusting the external 'tool.arun' implementation and proper configuration, but these are operational considerations rather than security flaws."
