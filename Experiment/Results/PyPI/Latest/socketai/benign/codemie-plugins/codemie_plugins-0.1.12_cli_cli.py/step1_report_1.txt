{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing CodeMie Plugins, including configuration, command execution, and graceful shutdown handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (KEY_PLUGIN_KEY, KEY_PLUGIN_ENGINE_URI), command-line options (--plugin-key, --plugin-engine-uri, --debug), and imports modules and functions for CLI commands and utilities.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables (KEY_PLUGIN_KEY, KEY_PLUGIN_ENGINE_URI), calls process termination methods (terminate, cancel, close), and exits the program via sys.exit().",
  "flows": "User inputs or environment variables provide data that is used to configure environment variables and trigger process control methods; signals like SIGINT/SIGTERM invoke cleanup and sys.exit(), ensuring orderly shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard process cleanup and signal handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious command execution patterns; no obfuscated code or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages CLI commands, environment setup, process cleanup, and signal handling with clear, standard methods. It registers commands and adds process management functions, including safe cleanup on shutdown signals. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious command execution is detected. The code’s structure and operations are consistent with a typical CLI utility, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a well-structured CLI management script with standard process and signal handling. It does not exhibit any malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior, nor does it include suspicious network activity or backdoors. Overall, it is safe based on the analysis.",
