{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with CodeMie Plugins, including commands for configuration, development, listing, and MCP management, with setup for graceful shutdown and environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PLUGIN_KEY, PLUGIN_ENGINE_URI), command-line options (--plugin-key, --plugin-engine-uri, --debug), imported modules, and user-provided command arguments.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables set via os.environ, command outputs via click.echo, and process termination via process methods (terminate, cancel, close).",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or CLI options are resolved and stored in environment variables and context. Signal handlers intercept termination signals to trigger cleanup processes. Processes registered are terminated or canceled during cleanup. Help commands and version display are purely informational.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Process cleanup appears standard. Use of rich library for output formatting is non-malicious. No network calls, file manipulation, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a CLI tool using the click library, with extensive help formatting via rich, environment variable resolution, and process cleanup for graceful termination. The environment variables are configured based on CLI options and config values, not hardcoded secrets. Signal handling ensures processes are terminated properly. The registration of processes for cleanup appears standard, with no suspicious commands or code patterns. No network activity, file access, or data theft mechanisms are present. The code functions as an orchestrator for CLI commands without executing any malicious or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI setup for a plugin system with environment configuration, help formatting, and process management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall security risk is low.",
