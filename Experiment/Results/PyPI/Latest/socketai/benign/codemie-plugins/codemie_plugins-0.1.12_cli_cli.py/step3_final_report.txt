{
  "purpose": "The code manages CLI commands, environment variables, process cleanup, and signal handling for a plugin system, providing user interaction and graceful shutdown.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, command-line options, and user input; imports modules for CLI commands and utilities.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variables, calls process termination methods, sys.exit(), and prints banners and help panels.",
  "flows": "User inputs and environment variables influence configuration; signals trigger cleanup routines; command options determine behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of setattr on builtins to register a global function, but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI utility with process and signal handling, environment management, and rich help formatting. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The global registration of a function via setattr is unusual but benign. The process cleanup routines are typical for CLI tools and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, benign CLI utility for plugin management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
