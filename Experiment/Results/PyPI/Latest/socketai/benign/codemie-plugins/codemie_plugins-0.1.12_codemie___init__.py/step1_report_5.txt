  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package, likely for general utility or application purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external input or user data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections or file operations, but none are explicitly identified in the code provided.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. No external data flows or dynamic code execution are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears straightforward, following standard Python practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The absence of external input handling, network communication, or secret data suggests low risk. The structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The code seems benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
