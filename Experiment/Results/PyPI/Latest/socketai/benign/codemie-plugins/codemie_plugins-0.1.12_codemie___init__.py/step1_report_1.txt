  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a demonstration or utility script, but since no code is provided, the actual intent cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not specified; no explicit data reading or input functions observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detectable from the empty code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is empty; therefore, there are no code behaviors, no input/output operations, and no suspicious activity to analyze. Without code, it is impossible to identify malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "No code present to review; based on the absence of content, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Confidence is high that there is no malicious code, but the lack of content limits the analysis.",
