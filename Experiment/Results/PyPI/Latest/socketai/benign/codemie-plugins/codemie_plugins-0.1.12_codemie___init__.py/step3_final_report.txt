{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign, primarily reading environment variables or performing straightforward data processing without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, possibly file inputs, or standard input",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console, files, or network (if present), but no suspicious or malicious sinks identified",
  "flows": "Source (environment variables/input) to output or processing functions, with no suspicious data exfiltration or command execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It reads data from environment variables or files and processes it normally. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (0.95), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, and the scores accurately reflect the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
