  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for data processing or utility purposes, with no explicit purpose clearly indicated.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, standard input, or files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network (if present). No explicit sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files) to output sinks (console, files) without obvious malicious manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed. No unusual imports or code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with typical structure for input reading, processing, and output. No signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and functions suggests benign intent. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected. Without further context or hidden code, the script appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a benign script with standard input-output processing.",
