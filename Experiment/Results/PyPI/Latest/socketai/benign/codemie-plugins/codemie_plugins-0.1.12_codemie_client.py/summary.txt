  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The main concern is the use of os.system() to run external scripts based on environment variables, which could be exploited if environment setup is insecure. Scores are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is around 0.2-0.3. Recommendations include validating environment variables before use and replacing os.system with safer subprocess calls."
