  "purpose": "Calculate reliability metrics for products based on shipment and return data",
  "sources": "pd.DataFrame input data, calculation functions from utils module",
  "sinks": "No evident sink involving untrusted data or external output",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame through calculations to stored metrics and summary",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of calculations appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code processes a DataFrame containing shipment and return data to compute various reliability metrics. It imports pandas and a utility function. The class initializes with data, and the main method computes several metrics, including failure rates and shipment rates, based on transformations and groupings. The calculations are straightforward and focused on data analysis. No external network operations, system modifications, or malicious code patterns are detected. The only notable point is the calculation of 'fit_rate', which involves multiplying by 1e9, but this appears to be a scaling factor rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data analysis for reliability metrics with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
