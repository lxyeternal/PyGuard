{
  "purpose": "Calculate various reliability metrics for products based on shipment and return data within a DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via the 'data' parameter in the constructor, specifically reading columns like 'ship_month', 'return_month', 'ship_qty', 'return_qty', and 'product_name'.",
  "sinks": "Computed metrics such as 'failure_rate', 'cumulative_failure_rate', 'fit_rate', and groupby aggregations; no external sinks or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input DataFrame, processed through calculations involving grouping, cumulative sums, and mathematical operations; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom function 'calculate_days_between_months' imported from utils, but this appears as a standard utility function without suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to compute product reliability metrics based on shipment and return data. It performs standard data manipulations such as groupby, cumulative sums, and ratio calculations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The calculations are straightforward and aligned with typical analytics tasks. The only external dependency is a utility function for date calculations, which appears benign. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing module for reliability metrics with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified. It performs typical calculations without any signs of malware, data leaks, or backdoors.",
