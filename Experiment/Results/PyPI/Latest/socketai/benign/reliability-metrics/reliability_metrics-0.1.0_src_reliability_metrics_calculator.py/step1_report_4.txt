  "purpose": "Calculate reliability metrics for products based on shipment and return data.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame 'data' provided at initialization; method 'calculate_days_between_months' imported from utils module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; calculations are performed on provided DataFrame data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from self.data into calculations, including groupbys and column computations; no external data flows or outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of mathematical operations and groupby are standard; no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for computing metrics based on provided DataFrame. It applies a lambda function for date calculations, performs groupby aggregations, and computes ratios and metrics. All operations appear to process input data directly and logically. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or hidden behaviors are observed. The imported utility function is presumed safe unless proven otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing module for calculating reliability metrics without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks are evident. The code functions as expected for its purpose.",
