  "purpose": "Calculate reliability metrics for products based on shipment and return data",
  "sources": "DataFrame input, calculation functions (calculate_days_between_months)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; computations are confined to DataFrame manipulations",
  "flows": "Data input (self.data) -> calculations in compute_metrics() -> results in self.metrics",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed. The code performs typical data processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for calculating various reliability metrics from shipment data. It uses pandas for data manipulation and applies a custom utility function for date calculations. The computations involve straightforward arithmetic and groupby operations. No external data or network activity is involved. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. The metric calculations, including failure rate and fit rate, appear standard and relevant to the context. The code does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing module for reliability metrics, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles data within pandas DataFrames without external communication or dangerous operations.",
