  "purpose": "Calculate reliability metrics such as failure rate, cumulative failure rate, MTTF, MTBF, and fit rate from shipment and return data in a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns: 'ship_month', 'return_month', 'product_name', 'ship_qty', 'return_qty'; external utility function 'calculate_days_between_months'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Input data (columns) -> calculations of days in field, cumulative sums, ratios -> metrics stored in DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward calculations. Use of external utility 'calculate_days_between_months' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard class for computing reliability metrics using pandas operations. It applies groupby, cumsum, ratios, and a custom date difference function. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The 'fit_rate' calculation involves a scaling factor but is typical for normalization. The code's logic is transparent and aligns with typical analytics tasks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The external utility function appears benign, and the calculations are standard for such metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data analysis module for reliability metrics. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The scores from previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. The overall security risk should be set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
