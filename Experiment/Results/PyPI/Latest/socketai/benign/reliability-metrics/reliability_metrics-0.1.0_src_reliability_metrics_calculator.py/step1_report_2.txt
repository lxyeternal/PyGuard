  "purpose": "Calculate reliability metrics for products based on shipment and return data, and generate summaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrame 'data' provided at initialization, and 'calculate_days_between_months' from utils module.",
  "sinks": "Performs data calculations and groupby aggregations; no evident sinks leading to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data -> DataFrame manipulations -> Computed metrics -> Summary output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of lambda with external utility function appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code processes a DataFrame, computes several metrics including failure rates and shipment statistics, and outputs the metrics and summaries. The external function 'calculate_days_between_months' is used for date difference calculations. All operations are typical data transformations; no network, file I/O, or system commands are present. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected. The calculations seem to be for statistical analysis rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward reliability metrics calculator with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
