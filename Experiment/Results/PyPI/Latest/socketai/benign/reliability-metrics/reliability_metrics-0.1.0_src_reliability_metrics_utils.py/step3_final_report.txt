  "purpose": "Calculate the number of days between two date strings representing months.",
  "sources": "start_month and end_month input parameters, intended to be date strings.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the difference in days; no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> pd.to_datetime() -> datetime objects -> subtraction -> days difference -> return",
  "anomalies": "Missing import of pandas as pd, which would cause a runtime error; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to convert two date strings to datetime objects and compute the days between them. It references pd.to_datetime() but does not import pandas, leading to a NameError at runtime. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The logic is straightforward and correct if pandas is imported. The missing import is a bug, not malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate, reflecting a minor bug without security implications. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8), given the clear missing import and absence of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function with a missing pandas import, which causes a runtime error but does not indicate malicious intent. There is no malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are justified. The main action needed is to add the pandas import to fix the bug.",
