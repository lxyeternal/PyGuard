{
  "purpose": "Calculate the number of days between two given months/dates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_month, end_month (expected to be date strings).",
  "sinks": "Return statement calculates the difference in days; no data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "The function converts input date strings to datetime objects and computes the difference in days.",
  "anomalies": "The code references 'pd.to_datetime' without importing pandas, which would cause a runtime error but not an obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function is intended to parse date strings into datetime objects and calculate the days between them. It relies on pandas, but pandas is not imported in this snippet, which suggests incomplete code or a missing import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The absence of imports could be an error or incomplete code, but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code aims to calculate days between two months but is incomplete due to missing pandas import. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The main concern is a likely runtime error rather than malicious activity.",
