  "purpose": "Utility function to calculate the number of days between two months/dates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'start_month' and 'end_month' used in pd.to_datetime() conversions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the function returns a computed integer value.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to datetime objects, then the difference in days is calculated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'pd.to_datetime()' but pandas is not imported, which will cause a runtime error. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The function aims to compute days between two date strings. It relies on pandas' 'to_datetime' but lacks the import statement for pandas, indicating an incomplete implementation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscation or malware patterns are evident. The missing import could be an oversight but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function with a missing import statement; it does not contain malicious behavior but is incomplete. No security risks or malware are detected based on the provided snippet.",
