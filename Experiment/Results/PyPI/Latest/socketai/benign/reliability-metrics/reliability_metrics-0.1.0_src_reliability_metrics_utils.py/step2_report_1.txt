  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code intends to convert input strings to datetime objects and compute the days difference.\n- The main technical flaw across all reports is the missing import of pandas (`import pandas as pd`), which would cause a runtime error.\n- No report claims or suggests malicious behavior; they all note no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- The \"anomalies\" noted are consistent: missing import leading to potential runtime errors, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The core logic is straightforward and correct for date difference calculation, assuming pandas is imported.\n- **Issue presence:** The missing pandas import is consistently identified, which is an actual bug, but not malicious.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior or code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk (securityRisk):** All reports assign 0.1, citing a minor issue (missing import), which is reasonable. The risk is low but not zero because runtime errors could affect reliability.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **confidence scores** range from 0.6 to 0.8, reflecting the certainty about the missing import and lack of malicious activity.\n- The **anomalies** are correctly identified as missing import statements, which could cause runtime errors but are not security issues per se.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **scores are reasonable** given the evidence.\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased if we consider that runtime errors due to missing imports could impact security or reliability, but 0.1 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the missing import issue)\n- **Overall malware and obfuscated scores:** consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify the incomplete code and the missing import but do not suggest malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to missing import causing potential runtime errors)\n\nThe overall conclusion is that the code is a simple utility with a minor bug, no malware, and negligible security risk.",
