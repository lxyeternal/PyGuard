{
  "purpose": "Calculate the number of days between two months given as input.",
  "sources": "start_month and end_month parameters, which are expected to be date strings or objects compatible with pandas.to_datetime.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the function returns a computed integer.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to datetime objects, then their difference in days is computed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code references 'pd.to_datetime' but does not import pandas as 'pd', leading to a NameError if executed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function aims to calculate days between two date inputs. It relies on pandas for date conversion but lacks the import statement, indicating incomplete or faulty code. No signs of malicious intent or malware are present. The core logic is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. The absence of an import statement suggests a possible oversight rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to compute date differences, with a missing pandas import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, aside from the potential for runtime errors due to the missing import.",
