{
  "purpose": "Calculate the number of days between two months given as input.",
  "sources": "start_month and end_month parameters provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The subtraction operation on datetime objects and the return statement, but no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to datetime objects, then their difference in days is computed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code references pd.to_datetime but does not import pandas, which could lead to a runtime NameError; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function aims to compute days between two months, converting input strings to datetime objects using pandas. However, the code is incomplete as it omits the import of pandas (import pandas as pd), which is necessary for pd.to_datetime to work. This oversight suggests a possible bug but not malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent from this fragment. The lack of an import statement indicates a potential for runtime failure but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code intends to calculate days between months but is incomplete due to missing pandas import. There is no evidence of malicious behavior; the main issue is a likely bug rather than security concern.",
