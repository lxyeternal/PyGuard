  "purpose": "Calculate the number of days between two specified months.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: start_month, end_month",
  "sinks": "pd.to_datetime conversion, date difference calculation",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> pd.to_datetime -> date objects -> subtraction -> days difference",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'pd' without import; no apparent malicious behavior, but missing import of pandas might cause runtime error; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute days between two months by converting string inputs to datetime objects using pandas' to_datetime. However, pandas ('pd') is not imported, which indicates incomplete code or an error. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The function performs a straightforward calculation without external data leaks or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears intended for a simple date difference calculation but is incomplete due to missing pandas import. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
