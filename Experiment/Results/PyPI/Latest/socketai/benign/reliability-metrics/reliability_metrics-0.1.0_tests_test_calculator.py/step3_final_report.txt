  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator class, verifying calculation correctness with sample data.",
  "sources": "Sample data defined within the fixture, used as input for the calculator.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; all data is in-memory and local.",
  "flows": "Sample data flows into the calculator instance, which processes it and outputs metrics for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test suite importing standard libraries, creating sample data, and verifying expected outputs. No network, environment, or external file operations are present. The code performs basic calculations and assertions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the lack of suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is negligible. The code's purpose is purely testing, and no malicious or security-sensitive behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and non-malicious implementation.",
