{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator class, intended to verify the correctness of its metric computations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the sample_data fixture, which provides pandas DataFrame with product and shipment data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not write data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sample_data fixture into the calculator instance, then through method calls like compute_metrics() and get_summary() which process the data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a unit test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pandas and pytest, then defines a fixture returning sample data for testing. It creates test functions to verify that the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator produces expected columns and calculations. There are no external inputs beyond the fixture data, no dynamic code execution, or data leaks. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a Python class, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It merely validates functionality with sample data and does not perform any harmful operations.",
