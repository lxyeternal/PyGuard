{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator class, verifying its functionality using sample data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a pandas DataFrame provided by a pytest fixture.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "Test data flows from the fixture into the calculator instance, which processes and produces metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pandas, pytest, and a class from a module, then defines a data fixture with sample data. It includes test functions that instantiate the calculator, invoke methods, and assert expected outcomes. There are no external network calls, no eval or exec, and no manipulation of environment variables. The code appears straightforward, designed solely for testing the calculator's functionality without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for verifying the correctness of a calculator class. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and aligned with typical testing practices.",
