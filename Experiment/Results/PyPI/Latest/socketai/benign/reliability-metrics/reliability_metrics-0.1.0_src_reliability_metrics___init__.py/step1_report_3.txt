{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the reliability_metrics package by importing a calculator class for reliability metrics calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statement for ReliabilityMetricsCalculator from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only performs an import and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets the __all__ variable to control exports. It contains no user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data. The structure is minimal and typical for package initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a straightforward purpose of exposing a class from a local module without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard boilerplate code for a Python package.",
