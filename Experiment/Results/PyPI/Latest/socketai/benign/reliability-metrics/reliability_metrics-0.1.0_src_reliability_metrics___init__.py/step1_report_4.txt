  "purpose": "This module initializes the reliability_metrics package by importing and exposing the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .calculator module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple import and export of a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and defines the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols. It appears to be a standard __init__.py file used for package setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code performs a basic function typical of Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
