  "purpose": "This code initializes the reliability_metrics package by importing and exposing the ReliabilityMetricsCalculator class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .calculator module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data output points present",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the class from the calculator module; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer, importing a class and defining what is exported. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The code structure is standard for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only as a package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
