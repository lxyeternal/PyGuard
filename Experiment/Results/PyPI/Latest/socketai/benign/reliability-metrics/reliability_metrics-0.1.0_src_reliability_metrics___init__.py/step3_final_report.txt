  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from local module; no data flow involving external or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a class and sets __all__. It contains no user input, external data, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The structure is standard for Python packages, and the code performs only import/export functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
