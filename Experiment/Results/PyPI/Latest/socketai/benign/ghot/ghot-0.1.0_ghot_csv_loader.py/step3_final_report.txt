{
  "purpose": "Load CSV data, parse headers, and map each row to a User object using pattern-based formatting.",
  "sources": "File input specified by 'path', reading CSV rows, and header line for schema extraction.",
  "sinks": "Mapping data to User object attributes via formatter; no data leaks or external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "File read -> header parsing -> schema setup -> row data -> formatter formatting -> User object creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exit(1)' on file not found; reliance on external PatternFormatter without implementation details; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CSV loader that reads headers, maps each row to a User object, and formats fields via an external formatter. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code are present. Error handling is abrupt but not malicious. External PatternFormatter could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CSV data loader with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The external formatter's behavior cannot be assessed here but does not appear malicious. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
