{
  "purpose": "This code defines a CSV loader class that reads user data from a CSV file and maps each row to a User object, with customizable patterns for each field.",
  "sources": "File input from the provided path in the load method; CSV header and rows as data sources.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reading from file; the print() function in case of FileNotFoundError; the formatter's format method during mapping.",
  "flows": "The load() method reads the file, passes the header to load_schema(), then processes each data row through map() which uses formatter.format() for each field to produce User objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely opens and reads a CSV file, converts headers to a schema, and maps rows to User objects using a formatter. No user input is directly executed; no network operations, no system commands, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. Error handling is minimal but appropriate for missing files. The use of exit() could be considered abrupt but is not malicious. Overall, the structure is standard, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard CSV loading and mapping operation without any malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activities. The overall security risk appears negligible.",
