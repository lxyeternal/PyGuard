{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load user data from a CSV file and map each row to a User object using specified patterns and a formatter.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a CSV file specified by the 'path' parameter in the load() method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly output untrusted data to external systems; it processes data internally and creates User objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the CSV file (source) into the csv.reader, then through load_schema and map methods, where data is formatted and assigned to User objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code calls 'exit(1)' upon a FileNotFoundError, which abruptly terminates the program; this could be misused to disrupt operations but is not malicious per se. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a CSV file, extracts the header to define a schema, and then maps each data row to a User object using a formatter. The formatter uses patterns that could be customized but are not inherently malicious. The exit call on file error might disrupt processes but is not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, external network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CSV loader and mapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data internally and relies on external patterns and a formatter. The abrupt exit on file error could cause operational issues but does not constitute malicious intent.",
