  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides pattern-based string formatting with safe expression evaluation, limited to whitelisted functions. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, as no malicious activity is reported or evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified as the use of 'ast' parsing could pose risks if patterns are untrusted, but the whitelist mitigates this.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the use of 'ast.parse' with whitelisted functions makes the evaluation safe, with no signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified, given the potential risk if patterns are untrusted, but mitigated.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Reasoning is sound; the risk score appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code uses controlled AST parsing with whitelisted functions, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified as before.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the controlled AST parsing and whitelisted functions, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the safe, controlled string formatting with limited functions, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code employs 'ast.parse' with a whitelist of functions, which mitigates many injection risks.\n\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 or 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n- The main concern across reports is the potential risk if patterns are untrusted, but the code's safeguards are sufficient to keep this risk low.\n\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — as the reports note, the main risk is if untrusted patterns are used, but the whitelist and controlled AST evaluation mitigate this.\n\n- **Malware justification:** The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications, nor does it contain malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated justification:** Code clarity is high; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk justification:** The only concern is pattern trustworthiness; given the safeguards, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the actual security posture of the code. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears secure, with minimal risk if patterns are controlled or sanitized.",
