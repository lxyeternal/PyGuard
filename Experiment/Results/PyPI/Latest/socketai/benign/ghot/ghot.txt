      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured pattern formatter that minimizes security risks through whitelisting and AST parsing. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern relates to untrusted pattern inputs, but safeguards are sufficient to keep this risk low."

The low security risk score assigned in the reports is appropriate. External modules should be reviewed separately for security, but based solely on this code, it is safe."

The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (~0.2) scores are appropriate given its functionality and safeguards. It is safe to consider this code as benign and suitable for use in organizational management tasks."
