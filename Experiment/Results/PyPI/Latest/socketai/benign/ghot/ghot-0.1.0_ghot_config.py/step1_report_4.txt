{
  "purpose": "This code manages configuration files for a program, allowing loading, applying defaults, writing, and displaying configuration settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from user home directory (.ghot) and local directory (.ghot). It also reads input from function arguments in write_config and show_config.",
  "sinks": "The code writes configuration data to .ghot files and prints configuration details to standard output.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read and parsed in load_config and write_config. Data from these files flows into application defaults or display functions. User input in function calls can influence the behavior of read/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides configuration management features—loading configs from user and local directories, applying default values, updating configs, and displaying configs. All operations are performed via standard Python modules and practices. There are no suspicious network activities, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns. Functions manipulate configuration data securely and transparently, with no evident security flaws or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration handling utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard practices for configuration management without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
