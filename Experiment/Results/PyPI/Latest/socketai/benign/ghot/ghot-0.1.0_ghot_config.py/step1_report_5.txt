  "purpose": "Manage and apply configuration settings stored in INI files, with functionalities to load, modify, write, and display configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files (~/.ghot and .ghot), reading environment variables for paths, and parsing configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration files (~/.ghot or .ghot) to disk, potentially overwriting existing configurations.",
  "flows": "Loading config from files -> Modifying or retrieving data -> Writing back to config files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs standard configuration management operations without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Use of string split for key parsing is standard; no dynamic code execution or eval used.",
  "analysis": "The script performs configuration management tasks: loading config files from user directories, updating options, and writing back to files. Functions utilize standard libraries and patterns, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No untrusted data sources are involved beyond file reading, and writing operations are limited to configuration files. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing application settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads and writes configuration files safely, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
