  "purpose": "This code manages configuration files, allowing reading, writing, and displaying configuration options for an application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from files located at '~/.ghot' and '.ghot'.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to '~/.ghot' or '.ghot' files when updating configuration settings.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is read from files in 'load_config' and 'write_config'; data is written to these files in 'write_config'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard configuration management functions: loading config files, updating settings, and displaying config options. It reads configuration data securely, avoids executing untrusted code, and writes data directly to files without external network communication or system modification beyond file I/O. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles configuration files safely without suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
