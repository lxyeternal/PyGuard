  "purpose": "Manage GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for authentication, including loading, saving, and deleting tokens using keyring and user input.",
  "sources": "getpass.getpass() for user input, keyring.get_password() for retrieving stored token, input() for confirmation prompts.",
  "sinks": "keyring.set_password(), keyring.delete_password(), print() for displaying token info, input() for confirmation prompts.",
  "flows": "Input prompts (user enters token or confirmation) -> token storage or deletion via keyring -> token usage for GitHub authentication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries for input and secure storage. No malicious payload detected.",
  "analysis": "The code handles token management with standard security practices: user input for tokens, secure storage via keyring, and optional token deletion. No malicious code or backdoors are present. No data exfiltration or system harm mechanisms are evident. The code's purpose aligns with secure token management. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors were observed beyond normal credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical token management module for GitHub authentication, following best practices with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs legitimate functions related to credential handling without security risks.",
