  "purpose": "Manage GitHub Personal Access Tokens securely by loading, saving, and removing them using keyring, and providing authenticated GitHub client access.",
  "sources": "getpass.getpass() for user input; keyring.get_password() and keyring.set_password()/delete_password() for stored credentials; input() for user confirmation.",
  "sinks": "Passing the token to github.Auth.Token() for authentication; printing the token; deleting the stored token.",
  "flows": "User inputs token and confirmation; token stored/retrieved via keyring; token passed to GitHub API client; token printed or deleted based on user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected; usage of standard libraries and known packages.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages a GitHub PAT by prompting user input, storing securely in keyring, and providing options to view or delete the token. It uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It does not perform any network activity outside authenticating with GitHub, nor does it access or leak sensitive data besides the token managed locally. The code appears legitimate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured token management utility without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond standard credential handling, which is implemented securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
