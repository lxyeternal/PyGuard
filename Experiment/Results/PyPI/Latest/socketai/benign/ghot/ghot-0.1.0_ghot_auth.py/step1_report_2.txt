  "purpose": "Manage GitHub Personal Access Tokens securely, allowing user input, storage, retrieval, and deletion of tokens.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass.getpass and input functions; keyring.get_password for retrieving stored tokens; keyring.set_password for storing tokens; keyring.delete_password for deleting stored tokens.",
  "sinks": "Token used to authenticate with GitHub API; token printed to console; token stored or deleted in system keyring.",
  "flows": "User inputs token -> token stored in keyring or retrieved -> token used for GitHub API authentication -> token can be printed or deleted based on user commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of system keyring for secure storage is appropriate. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward mechanism for managing GitHub tokens, including input, storage, retrieval, and deletion. It properly uses secure storage (keyring) and prompts the user for sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious data exfiltration. The token is only printed upon explicit request, and deletion prompts are standard security practice. The overall implementation appears secure and intended solely for legitimate credential management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, secure implementation for managing GitHub Personal Access Tokens. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It operates within expected behaviors for credential handling and user interaction.",
