{
  "purpose": "The script compares two JSON files containing contract deployment and function metrics, then outputs a formatted markdown report highlighting differences.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files specified as command-line arguments, specifically JSON files containing contract metrics.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted markdown text to standard output; it does not send data elsewhere or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input files are loaded into memory; data is processed and differences are computed; results are printed as markdown to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data loading, comparison, and formatted output. It uses standard Python libraries with no eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The functions for loading JSON, simplifying contract names, computing differences, and printing markdown are straightforward and contain no suspicious logic. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The script only reads from provided files and outputs formatted text. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or malicious side effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign utility for comparing contract metrics and generating a report. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the code. Its functionality is limited to data processing and formatted output, with no external communications or system modifications.",
