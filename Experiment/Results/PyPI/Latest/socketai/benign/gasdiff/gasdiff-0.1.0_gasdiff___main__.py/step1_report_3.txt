{
  "purpose": "The script compares two JSON files containing deployment and function metrics for smart contracts, generating a markdown report of differences.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files specified as command-line arguments, specifically from paths provided as 'before.json' and 'after.json'. Uses 'open()' for file reading.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; data is processed and printed to standard output. No untrusted data is written to external systems, network, or files beyond reading the specified files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON file loading through diff calculations, then into formatted markdown output. No untrusted data is propagated into insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with standard use of Python functions and data structures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads two JSON files, extracts contract deployment and function metrics, compares these metrics, and outputs a formatted markdown table of differences. It performs standard operations such as file I/O, dictionary manipulation, and string formatting. No code injection, dynamic execution, or network activity occurs. The functions and flow are typical for data comparison tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script for comparing JSON-based metrics of smart contracts. It exhibits no malicious or suspicious behavior. The structure and operations are typical and safe. There are no indications of malware, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
