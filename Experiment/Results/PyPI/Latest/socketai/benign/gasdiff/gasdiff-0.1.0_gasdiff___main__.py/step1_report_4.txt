{
  "purpose": "The script compares two JSON files containing contract deployment and function metrics, and outputs the differences in a markdown table format.",
  "sources": "The code reads input JSON files specified via command-line arguments (`before.json` and `after.json`) using the `load_json` function, which opens and parses the files.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted markdown tables to standard output via `print_markdown_table`. There are no other notable sinks for untrusted data. No network, file, or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input JSON files (sources) through processing functions, with differences computed and then formatted for output (sink). There are no untrusted data flows leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The script performs straightforward data comparison and formatted output. No obfuscated or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple comparison utility that loads two JSON files, computes differences in deployment metrics and function stats, and prints the differences in markdown table format. The functions perform safe file I/O and data processing without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No use of dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are observed. The overall structure indicates a benign utility script for diffing JSON data.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a harmless utility for comparing contract metrics between two JSON datasets. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
