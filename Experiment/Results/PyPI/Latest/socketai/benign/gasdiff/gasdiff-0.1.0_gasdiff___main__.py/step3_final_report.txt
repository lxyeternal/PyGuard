  "purpose": "Compare deployment and function metrics between two JSON datasets related to smart contracts and output differences in markdown format.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files specified as command-line arguments; loads data structures from files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted markdown tables to standard output; no untrusted data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON data -> compares metrics -> formats differences -> prints markdown tables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that loads two JSON files, compares specific metrics ('gas', 'size', 'min', 'mean', 'median', 'max') for deployment and functions, and outputs the differences in markdown table format. It uses standard Python libraries, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. The logic is simple, with clear data flow, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or contain vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0, and confidence scores at 1. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, which is purely data comparison and reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, straightforward comparison utility for contract metrics. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
