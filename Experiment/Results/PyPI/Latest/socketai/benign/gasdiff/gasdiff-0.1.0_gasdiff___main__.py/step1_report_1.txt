{
  "purpose": "The code loads, compares, and formats differences between two JSON files containing contract deployment and function metrics, then outputs the differences in markdown format.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command line arguments; loads JSON files; reads and processes JSON content for contracts, deployments, and functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted markdown table to stdout; uses print statements for displaying comparison results.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON files -> processes contract data -> computes differences -> formats and prints output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are present. No malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file I/O operations, JSON parsing, data comparison, and formatted output. It does not include network access, file modification, or other potentially malicious activities. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears to serve a specific, benign purpose of comparing contract metrics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple comparison tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely processes input data and outputs the comparison results without any suspicious behavior.",
