{
  "purpose": "The script compares JSON files containing deployment and function metrics for smart contracts, generating a markdown report of differences.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files specified as command-line arguments, loads their content into dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted markdown report to stdout; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON data -> processes differences -> outputs report.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data processing: loading JSON files, calculating differences between corresponding entries, and formatting output. No use of eval, exec, network connections, or external commands. It strictly processes and displays data. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is simple, with clear input and output flows, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for reporting differences in contract metrics. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected. It is a standard data comparison script with no security risks identified.",
