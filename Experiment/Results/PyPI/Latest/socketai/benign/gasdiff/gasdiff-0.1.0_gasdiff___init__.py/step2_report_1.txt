  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or executable code beyond this assignment.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code fragment is benign and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 are justified and appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's harmless nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No overinterpretation of the code's intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no security implications. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and is justified given the code's simplicity.",
