  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The data flow is a simple assignment from a string literal to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The confidence in benignity is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
