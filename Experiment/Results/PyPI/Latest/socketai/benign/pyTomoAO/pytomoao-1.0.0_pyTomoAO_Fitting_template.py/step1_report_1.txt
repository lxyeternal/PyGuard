{
  "purpose": "Define a class for performing least squares fitting of OPD maps to deformable mirror influence functions, facilitating the interaction with DM geometry objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs directly; it accesses the 'dmGeometry' object for attributes and internal attributes such as 'F' and 'IF'.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs to external systems are evident; no network, file, or data exfiltration functions are present.",
  "flows": "The main data flow involves setting and getting matrices ('F' and 'IF') and performing matrix multiplication in the 'fit' method. No external untrusted data sources or sinks are connected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward, with standard use of numpy and logging. The commented section indicates placeholders for actual object instantiation but does not introduce suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates typical data structures for matrix operations and relies on a 'dmGeometry' object for attribute forwarding. The 'fit' method performs a standard matrix multiplication to generate command vectors. Logging is used for debugging and attribute access. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard scientific/engineering utility with no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific utility for deformable mirror control, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. It is safe and lacks malicious intent.",
