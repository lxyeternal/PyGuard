{
  "purpose": "A class for performing least squares fitting of OPD maps to deformable mirror influence functions, likely used in adaptive optics systems.",
  "sources": "Input data such as 'opd_map' passed to the fit() method, and object attributes from 'dmGeometry'.",
  "sinks": "Potential output in the form of command vectors from the fit() method, but no evident data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input 'opd_map' flows into the 'fit' method, which multiplies it by the 'F' (fitting matrix) to produce command vectors. Attribute access may redirect to 'dmGeometry'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior such as hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code. Use of logging is benign. The code performs standard numpy operations and attribute forwarding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for setting and getting matrices, influence functions, and a fit function performing numpy dot products. Attribute forwarding to 'dmGeometry' appears safe. No network activity, file I/O, or suspicious behavior. Logging is used for debugging purposes only. The code is straightforward and standard for numerical computation in adaptive optics, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a fitting algorithm with no indicators of malicious behavior. It performs data processing and attribute forwarding in a typical manner without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
