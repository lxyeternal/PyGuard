  "purpose": "A class for fitting Optical Path Difference (OPD) maps to deformable mirror influence functions using matrix operations, facilitating adaptive optics calibration.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'opd_map' input parameter; accesses attributes of the 'dmGeometry' object via attribute forwarding.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the command vector resulting from matrix multiplication; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Multiplies the flattened 'opd_map' by the 'fitting_matrix' to produce the command vector; attribute access and setting are forwarded to 'dmGeometry'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; standard numpy and logging usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class managing matrices for optical system calibration, with proper validation and attribute forwarding. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The attribute forwarding to 'dmGeometry' could pose a risk if 'dmGeometry' is malicious, but this depends on external context. The 'fit' method performs a simple numpy dot product, typical for such applications. Logging is used for debugging, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for adaptive optics fitting, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to the external 'dmGeometry' object, but within this code, no malicious intent is evident.",
