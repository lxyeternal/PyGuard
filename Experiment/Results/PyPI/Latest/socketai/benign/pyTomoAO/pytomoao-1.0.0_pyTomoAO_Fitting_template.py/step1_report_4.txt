{
  "purpose": "Define a class for performing least squares fitting of Optical Path Difference (OPD) maps to Deformable Mirror (DM) influence functions in an optical system.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'dmGeometry' object, 'opd_map', and setting properties like 'F' and 'IF'.",
  "sinks": "The 'fit' method performs matrix multiplication with 'opd_map', producing a command vector. Attribute access is forwarded to 'dmGeometry'.",
  "flows": "Input data ('opd_map') flows into the 'fit' method; property setters and getters manipulate internal numpy arrays; attribute access may pass through to 'dmGeometry'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network calls are present. The code uses logging for debugging, no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. No insecure data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for fitting optical data, using standard numpy operations and attribute forwarding. It initializes with a 'dmGeometry' object and manages matrices with property setters/getters. The 'fit' method performs a dot product of the fitting matrix with the flattened OPD map. Logging is used for debugging. No external network calls, code injection, or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured mathematical utility for optical system calibration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific/engineering utility for optical fitting, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It safely manages data and performs intended computations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
