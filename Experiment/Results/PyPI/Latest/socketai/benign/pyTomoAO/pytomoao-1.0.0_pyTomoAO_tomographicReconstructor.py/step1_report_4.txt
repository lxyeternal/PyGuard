{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for tomographic wavefront reconstruction in adaptive optics systems, supporting GPU acceleration, parameter configuration, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from a YAML file, imports modules and classes, loads MATLAB files for testing, and accepts user input for configuration file path.",
  "sinks": "Uses data loaded from MATLAB files for testing purposes and may output figures; no data is sent over the network or written to system files.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from YAML file into class parameters; MATLAB test data flows into testing functions; user input can alter configuration file path; computational functions process data for reconstruction and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and well-defined third-party modules. The code includes GPU detection and conditional imports, which are normal for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a wavefront reconstruction class, involving parameter initialization, matrix computations, GPU/CPU conditional logic, and visualization. It loads configuration data and test data from MATLAB files, which is typical for scientific software. No malicious behaviors such as network communications, file tampering, reverse shells, or covert data exfiltration are present. The use of external modules and parameters appears standard. All operations are transparent and confined to scientific computation, visualization, and configuration management. No anomalies indicative of sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific application for adaptive optics wavefront reconstruction, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard libraries, conditional GPU acceleration, and safe data handling practices. There are no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malware signals detected.",
