{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for adaptive optics wavefront reconstruction, loading configuration parameters, performing matrix computations, and visualization for AO systems like LTAO and MOAO. It supports GPU acceleration and includes routines for validation against MATLAB data.",
  "sources": "Configuration YAML file, external modules, MATLAB test data files, external dependencies such as numpy, scipy.io, and optional GPU libraries.",
  "sinks": "No network activity or data exfiltration; data flows are internal within matrix computations, reconstructions, and visualizations.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration and MATLAB test data; processes matrices; outputs reconstructed wavefronts and visualizations; no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. GPU import is conditional and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured scientific Python module for AO wavefront reconstruction. It loads configuration from YAML, performs matrix calculations, and includes routines for validation against MATLAB data. External dependencies are domain-specific and legitimate. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. GPU support is implemented with try-except, which is standard. The routines for testing and visualization are typical for scientific software. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent scientific implementation for adaptive optics wavefront reconstruction, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments.",
