{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python class for tomographic wavefront reconstruction in adaptive optics systems, supporting both model-based and interaction matrix-based approaches, with optional GPU acceleration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a YAML file; imports data from external modules and libraries; loads MATLAB data files during testing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform malicious actions are present; no network connections, file writing, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from YAML file into class parameters; external data (e.g., MATLAB files) is loaded for testing; internal computations use libraries and GPU/CPU routines without data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic code execution. Logging is standard. No suspicious network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured and documented, primarily performing computational tasks related to wavefront reconstruction. It conditionally imports GPU or CPU modules, but this is a benign optimization. All data handling appears to be limited to file I/O and in-memory processing. The external dependencies are specialized modules for adaptive optics, with no indication of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or system modifications are present. Testing routines load external MATLAB files but do not transmit or modify data maliciously. The overall logic aligns with standard scientific computing practices, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific application for adaptive optics wavefront reconstruction with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs standard practices, conditional GPU acceleration, and external data loading for testing. No malicious signals or suspicious actions are detected.",
