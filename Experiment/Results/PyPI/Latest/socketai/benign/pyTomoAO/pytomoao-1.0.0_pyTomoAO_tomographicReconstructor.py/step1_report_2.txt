{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for computing a tomographic reconstructor in adaptive optics systems, including model and interaction matrix based approaches, with visualization and testing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration YAML file, importing modules (yaml, numpy, scipy.io), loading data from MATLAB files during testing, and reading/writing parameters from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally. No data leakage or unsafe data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from YAML file into parameter objects, then into reconstructor building functions. Data loaded from MATLAB files for testing. Computed matrices flow between methods for reconstruction, correlation, and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Use of try-except for GPU module import is standard. No unusual code behavior or obfuscation. No hidden network activity, reverse shells, or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data and parameters, performs numerical computations for atmospheric tomography, builds matrices, and visualizes results. It supports GPU acceleration with cupy, falling back to CPU. The class methods follow standard practices for scientific computing, including data validation and error handling. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, remote control, or covert backdoors are present. The only external interactions are reading configuration files and MATLAB test data, which are typical for this domain. The code structure and content are consistent with a scientific computing application with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific application designed for tomographic wavefront reconstruction. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It performs standard numerical and visualization tasks without any suspicious operations or data leaks.",
