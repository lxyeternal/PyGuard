{
  "purpose": "The code models atmospheric parameters for optical turbulence, including layer altitudes, wind profiles, and derived parameters, primarily for simulation or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input (`config`) providing atmospheric parameters; internal property setters validating data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no data is written to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the configuration input to object properties; derived properties like `airmass`, `r0`, and wind components are computed internally without external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard validation, computations, and string representation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for atmospheric parameters with robust validation, derived properties, and a clear structure. It reads configuration data via a dictionary, validates input types and ranges, and calculates parameters such as airmass, wind components, and Fried parameters. The string representation includes detailed info for each atmospheric layer, including wind components. There are no network calls, file operations, or code injections. All operations appear to be related solely to data encapsulation and computation, consistent with its purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, safe atmospheric parameter modeling class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies entirely on input data and performs computations internally, with no external communication or hidden functionalities.",
