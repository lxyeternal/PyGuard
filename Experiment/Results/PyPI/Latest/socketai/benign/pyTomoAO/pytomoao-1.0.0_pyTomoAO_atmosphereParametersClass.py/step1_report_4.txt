{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for modeling atmospheric parameters related to optical turbulence, including properties like altitude, wind profiles, and turbulence strength, with validation and derived parameters.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input in __init__, property setters, validation functions, and data arrays such as altitude, windDirection, windSpeed, and fractionalR0.",
  "sinks": "Derived parameters like r0 and properties involving wind components (windVx, windVy), but no direct data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input configuration to class properties through setters, which validate data. Derived properties (airmass, r0, wind components) are computed internally. No external data flows or network operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code performs standard validation, calculation, and data encapsulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The class uses numpy and math libraries safely; no dynamic code execution or injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a data model with validation for atmospheric parameters. All inputs are validated for type, range, and consistency. Derived properties are correctly computed from validated inputs. Wind components are calculated using straightforward trigonometric functions. No external data or network operations are present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected. The code serves a scientific modeling purpose and performs no malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, well-structured data model for atmospheric parameters with proper validation and calculations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The overall security risk is negligible.",
