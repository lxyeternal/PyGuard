{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for modeling atmospheric parameters for optical turbulence analysis, including validation and property calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a provided dictionary; accesses class properties and internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the input dictionary into class properties; derived properties like windVx, windVy, and r0 are computed internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input validation, data encapsulation, and property management for atmospheric parameters. It includes detailed validation for array lengths, value ranges, and physical plausibility. The wind components are calculated from input angles and speeds. No code injection, external data access, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not perform network communication or system modifications. Overall, the implementation appears to be a straightforward, well-structured model class with appropriate safeguards. No signs of sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured Python class for atmospheric parameter modeling with proper validation and no malicious intent detected.",
