{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing atmospheric parameters used in optical turbulence modeling, including properties like altitude, wind profiles, and turbulence strength, with validation and derived calculations.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input in __init__, property setters for various parameters, and array inputs such as altitude, windDirection, windSpeed, and fractionnalR0.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks for untrusted data such as network transmission, file I/O, or system modification. The code primarily processes and validates input data without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the configuration dictionary to property setters, which validate and store data. Derived properties like windVx and windVy depend on windSpeed and windDirection. No external data transmission or command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features are present. The code relies on standard Python modules, with straightforward validation. No obfuscated or misleading code structures detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class encapsulating atmospheric parameters with validation checks to ensure data correctness. It computes derived properties such as airmass, wind components, and Fried parameter. All operations are confined within validation and calculation functions. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The example usage demonstrates typical initialization without malicious intent. Overall, the code appears purely for scientific computation with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard scientific modeling class for atmospheric parameters. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It performs validation and calculation of atmospheric properties without external or harmful effects. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
