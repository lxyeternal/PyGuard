{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to encapsulate atmospheric parameters for optical turbulence modeling, including validation and derived property calculations.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input at initialization, array parameters (altitude, windDirection, windSpeed, fractionnalR0), and property setters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data exfiltration points; no network or file I/O operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input configuration to class properties, with validation, then to derived properties and string representation; no external untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of numpy and math libraries is standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically initializes atmospheric parameters, validating input data for correctness and consistency. It computes derived parameters such as airmass and wind components. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors are evident. The only potential concern is that the code handles arrays and computes wind components, but these are standard operations in atmospheric modeling. The example usage is typical and demonstrates proper class instantiation without malicious intent. Overall, the code appears purely focused on atmospheric data management with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign atmospheric parameter management class with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard validation, calculation, and representation tasks without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
