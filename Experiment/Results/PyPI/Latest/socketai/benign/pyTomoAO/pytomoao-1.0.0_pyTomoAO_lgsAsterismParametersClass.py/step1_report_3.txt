  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing and validating Laser Guide Star (LGS) asterism parameters, including geometric calculations and string representation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a configuration dictionary, including 'radiusAst', 'LGSwavelength', 'baseLGSHeight', and 'nLGS'. Uses atmosphereParameters object for atmospheric data.",
  "sinks": "Uses atmospheric parameters and internal calculations; no evident sinks that handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input config -> Class properties -> Geometric calculations and string formatting -> Output string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard geometric calculations and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for LGS parameters with validation, geometric computation, and detailed string output. It uses input from a configuration dictionary and atmospheric parameters. The methods perform standard mathematical conversions and vector computations. No external data is read during execution beyond initial configuration; no network, file, or environment variable access is present. The example usage constructs objects with sample data, with no malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The geometry calculations and string formatting are typical for such applications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of LGS parameter management with validation and geometric calculations. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger astronomical or adaptive optics software suite.",
