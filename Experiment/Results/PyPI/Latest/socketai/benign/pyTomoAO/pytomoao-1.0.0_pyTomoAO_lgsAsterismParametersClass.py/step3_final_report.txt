  "purpose": "Manage and validate Laser Guide Star (LGS) asterism parameters, compute geometry and directions, and provide human-readable summaries.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary inputs, atmosphereParameters object, internal property setters, and class methods computing geometry and vectors.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data outputs; primarily internal computations and string formatting.",
  "flows": "Input data from config and atmosphereParameters -> validation in setters -> geometric calculations in methods -> string formatting for display.",
  "anomalies": "Comment in LGSdirections mentions specific azimuth angles (225°, 135°, 315°, 45°) but code generates evenly spaced azimuths starting at 0°, which is inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, well-structured class for managing LGS parameters with proper validation, geometric calculations, and formatting. No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, and no external data leaks are present. The only minor inconsistency is in the azimuth comment versus implementation, which does not impact security. Validation logic is appropriate, and calculations are standard for the domain. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. It performs standard parameter management and geometric computations for LGS systems. The low security risk score is appropriate, and no malware or obfuscation concerns are present.",
