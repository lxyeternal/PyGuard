  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs only import statements from local modules.\n- It defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported.\n- It sets a version string `__version__ = \"1.0.0\"`.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- No input/output operations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious or unusual patterns.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard module setup, with no malicious activity, no anomalies, and no security risks.\n- They assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**\n- Malware score: 0 is correct; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk score: 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n**Any inconsistencies?**\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or setup module.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export setup, it cannot execute malicious actions unless the imported modules themselves are malicious. But based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The version string is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code poses no security risk, no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard module setup with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.",
