{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing specific classes and functions from local modules, defining the exported symbols via __all__, and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script, importing classes/functions from local modules, defining __all__, and setting __version__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The import statements are standard, and the __all__ list clearly specifies exported symbols. The version string is a typical static assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign. All signals point to a safe, standard module initialization pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It poses no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
