{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a module by importing specific classes and functions and setting the module's version.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and the __all__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only sets up module exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static imports of classes and functions, declares a list of exports (__all__), and sets a version string. All operations are standard for Python module setup, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, nor any code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely organizes and exposes module components with a version number.",
