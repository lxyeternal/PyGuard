{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes and functions from local modules and defines an export list for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Local module imports using relative import syntax (e.g., from .atmosphereParametersClass import atmosphereParameters).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, network connections, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears standard for a module's __init__.py or similar setup file.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative imports from local modules, defining the __all__ list for module exports, and setting a version string. It does not perform any runtime data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The structure is typical for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply organizes module exports.",
