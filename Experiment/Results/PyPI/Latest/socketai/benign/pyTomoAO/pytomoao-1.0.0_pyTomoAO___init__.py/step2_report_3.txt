  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward module setup: importing local classes/functions, defining `__all__`, and setting a version string. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code does not perform any runtime data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is standard package initialization code with no malicious intent. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0  \nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports find no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk, the scores are correctly set to zero. No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they rely on static analysis and standard code patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's characteristics and the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and standard.** No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores and analysis are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate (for completeness):\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature. No further action needed.",
