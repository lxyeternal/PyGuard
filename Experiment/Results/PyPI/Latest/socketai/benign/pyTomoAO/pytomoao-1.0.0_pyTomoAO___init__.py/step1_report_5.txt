{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions related to atmospheric, Asterism, WFS, tomography, DM parameters, and reconstruction, then exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules importing classes and functions; no external or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code only defines module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; module setup is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; the code is straightforward and standard for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from relative modules, defining the module's public interface via __all__, and setting a version string. It does not process any input data, connect to external services, or contain any dynamic or executable code beyond imports. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The structure indicates a typical package __init__.py file or module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file that imports and exposes certain classes and functions. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code is safe, with no anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
