  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup: importing classes/functions from local modules, defining `__all__`, and setting `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, external data handling, or dynamic execution.\n   - The code is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar setup file.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume vulnerabilities where none exist.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious intent.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence in this assessment is high, given the uniform agreement and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n- The current scoring is appropriate and should not be changed.\n- No further action is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on all reports and the code review, I concur that the scores are accurate. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be **0**.",
