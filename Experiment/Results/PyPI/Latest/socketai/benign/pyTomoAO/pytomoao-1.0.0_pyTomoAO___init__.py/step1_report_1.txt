{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines what symbols to export for the package, essentially setting up the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., atmosphereParametersClass, lgsAsterismParametersClass, etc.), and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data sinks or external communications are observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The __version__ string is a common practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and module exports. It imports several classes and functions from sibling modules, then defines the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols, and sets a version string. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. This is typical package initialization code with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply imports components and defines exports. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
