  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or insecure practices.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These are appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code, and the confidence is high. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the code as a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis correctly states that the code is a standard setup script, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, which is reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, fitting the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as others; the code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None apparent; all reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** All are set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, malware scores should remain at 0. The code performs standard package setup tasks without any suspicious or insecure operations.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only \"dynamic\" operation is reading the version via regex, which is common and not risky. No assumptions or vulnerabilities are introduced here.  \n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, well-understood setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are justified and should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code poses no security threat based on the provided analysis.",
