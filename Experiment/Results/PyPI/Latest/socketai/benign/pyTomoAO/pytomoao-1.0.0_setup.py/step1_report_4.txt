  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the pyTomoAO Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over the network, stored insecurely, or used in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "Version is read from __init__.py and used in the setup configuration; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. The code performs standard setup procedures without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and re modules to facilitate file handling and regex operations. It defines a function get_version() that reads the __init__.py file in the pyTomoAO directory to extract the __version__ string using a regex pattern. The setup() function uses this extracted version for package versioning and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads package metadata and dependencies to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
