  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for pyTomoAO for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file to extract the version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "Source (reading version from __init__.py) to package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse version; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and re for file handling and regex processing, then uses setuptools to define package info. The get_version function reads a specific file to extract the version string, which is then used in setup(). No external network calls, no use of environment variables for sensitive data, and no dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies listed are common scientific packages. The overall code structure follows standard practices for Python package setup without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
