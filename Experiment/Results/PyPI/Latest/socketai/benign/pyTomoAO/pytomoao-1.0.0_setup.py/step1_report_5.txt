  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'pyTomoAO' to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from 'pyTomoAO/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external interactions beyond package metadata definition.",
  "flows": "The version string from '__init__.py' flows into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of regex to extract version info is common; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function to extract the package version from a specific file. It then calls setup() with static and dynamic metadata, including dependencies and classifiers. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is apparent. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It performs standard operations securely.",
