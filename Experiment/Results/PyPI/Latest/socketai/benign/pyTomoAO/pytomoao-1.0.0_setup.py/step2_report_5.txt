  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python setup script that reads the package version from `pyTomoAO/__init__.py` using regex, then calls `setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is standard and free of malicious or insecure elements.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **In the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n  The reports are accurate. The use of regex to parse the version string is common practice, though slightly fragile if the format changes, but not a security concern.  \n  No significant errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code performs only static package setup tasks, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- **Malware:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, a malware score higher than 0 is unwarranted.\n- **Security risk:**  \n  No vulnerabilities or insecure practices are present; thus, a score above 0 is unjustified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is consistent with the code content.\n- The regex parsing of version is standard and not suspicious.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are involved.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' conclusions that this setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-understood setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only dynamic operation is reading a version string, which is a common practice.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain risk or malware. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
