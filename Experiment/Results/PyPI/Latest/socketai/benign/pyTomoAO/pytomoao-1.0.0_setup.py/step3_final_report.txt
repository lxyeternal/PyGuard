  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging the pyTomoAO project, reading version info and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'pyTomoAO/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading version string from file -> passing to setup() without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward static configuration; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static metadata and dependencies. It reads the version from a file using regex, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. All dependencies are common scientific packages. The code performs benign operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The regex parsing is simple and not risky. The overall structure is clear and follows best practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The code poses no supply chain threat and is safe for use.",
