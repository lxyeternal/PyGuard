{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyTomoAO', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file in the 'pyTomoAO' directory to extract version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The version is read from a file and passed into the setup function; no user input or untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, no obfuscated code. The only dynamic operation is extracting version info via regex, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a version string from a file and configuring package metadata. The get_version() function reads '__init__.py' and uses regex to find the version number. There are no network operations, code execution, or data leaks. The dependencies listed are common scientific libraries, with no indication of malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices without any suspicious activities.",
