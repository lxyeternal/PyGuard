  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the pyTomoAO Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "Read version from __init__.py -> use in setup() for package version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup procedures with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and re modules for file handling and regex processing, then defines a function get_version() that reads the __init__.py file in the pyTomoAO directory to extract the __version__ string. The setup() function is called with static package information, including name, description, URL, author details, license, package list, required dependencies, optional dependencies, and classifiers. All elements follow standard packaging practices without any dynamic code execution, input validation, or external data fetching. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected setup tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
