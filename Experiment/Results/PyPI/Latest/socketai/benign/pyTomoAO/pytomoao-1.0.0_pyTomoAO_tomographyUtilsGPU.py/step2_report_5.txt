The scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to complexity but no malicious intent)\n\nThis reflects a high-confidence assessment that the code is a legitimate scientific tool without malicious features.",
