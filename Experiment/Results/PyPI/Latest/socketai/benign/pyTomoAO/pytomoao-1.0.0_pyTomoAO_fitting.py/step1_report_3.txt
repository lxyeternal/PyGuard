{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for deformable mirror fitting operations, including influence function generation, actuator mapping, and wavefront fitting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from np.ndarray parameters such as opd_map, validActuatorsSupport, gridMask, and wavefront arrays; also reads attributes from dmParams object.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes influence function data, actuator coordinates, and fitting matrices, which could be misused if misappropriated; no evidence of writing to external files or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., opd_map, validActuatorsSupport, wavefronts) flows into functions like fit(), set_influence_function(), and map_actuators_to_new_grid(); influence functions and actuator data flow into plotting and matrix calculations; output includes command vectors, influence modes, and reconstructed wavefronts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Influence functions are computed via standard Gaussian formulas; mapping functions normalize and stretch coordinates but do not contain suspicious behavior. No code injections, external network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-structured Python module for deformable mirror control and wavefront fitting, including influence function calculations, coordinate mapping, and matrix operations. It utilizes standard scientific libraries (numpy, matplotlib) and handles data securely. The code reads input arrays and parameters and performs computations without any suspicious data exfiltration or malicious commands. The influence functions are generated using conventional Gaussian formulas, and there are no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent. The only potential concern could be misuse of stored influence matrices or actuator coordinates if accessed maliciously, but that is outside the scope of this code itself. Overall, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computation module for deformable mirror control, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It uses standard mathematical operations and file execution patterns typical in scientific code. The security risk is minimal, primarily limited to the misuse of influence data if accessed maliciously, but the code itself is safe.",
