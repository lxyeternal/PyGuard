  "purpose": "The code handles deformable mirror influence function generation, actuator coordinate mapping, and wavefront fitting via matrix operations. It creates influence functions based on Gaussian models, maps actuator positions between grids, and computes fitting matrices for wavefront correction.",
  "sources": "Reads actuator positions from dmParams.validActuatorsSupport, input wavefront maps, and influence parameters; uses external modules for plotting and data handling.",
  "sinks": "Performs internal matrix computations, visualizations, and data transformations; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Extracts actuator coordinates -> maps them to new grid -> generates influence functions -> computes fitting matrix -> applies fitting to wavefront maps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Influence functions are standard Gaussian models; no backdoors or malicious injections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of deformable mirror influence functions and wavefront fitting routines. It uses Gaussian influence models, coordinate transformations, and matrix operations typical in adaptive optics. No external data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The influence functions are generated via well-understood mathematical models, and the data flow is contained within the process. The visualizations and data handling are consistent with scientific computing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured scientific software for deformable mirror control. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The influence functions and fitting routines are standard and do not pose security concerns.",
