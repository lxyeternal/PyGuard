{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for deformable mirror (DM) influence function creation, actuator mapping, and wavefront fitting operations for adaptive optics systems, including influence function generation, mapping of actuator coordinates, and fitting wavefront OPD maps.",
  "sources": "Reads actuator positions from dmParams.validActuatorsSupport, input OPD maps for fitting, and external modules for reconstruction.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data is sent over networks or written to files, only internal calculations and visualizations.",
  "flows": "Reads actuator positions and influence function parameters (sources) -> computes influence functions and influence matrix (sink) -> performs fitting calculations (sink) -> visualizes influence functions and wavefront errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Influence functions are generated via standard Gaussian functions. The code is well-structured with no obfuscated parts, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. External plotting and numpy functions are used normally. No system commands, network calls, or file manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily focuses on influence function generation, actuator coordinate transformations, and wavefront fitting using numpy and matplotlib. It accesses parameters via dmParams, which might contain sensitive information, but this is typical for hardware parameter classes. No suspicious data leakage or external communications are present. The influence function creation and mapping functions are standard mathematical implementations. The code includes visualization for debugging and analysis but does not perform any external network activity or system modifications. Overall, no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, well-structured implementation of deformable mirror influence functions and wavefront fitting for adaptive optics, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity observed.",
