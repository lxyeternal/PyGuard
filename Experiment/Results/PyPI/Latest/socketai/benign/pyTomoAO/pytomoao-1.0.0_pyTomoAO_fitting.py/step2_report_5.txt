  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning behind the scores, and the consistency of the scoring with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function—generating influence functions, actuator mapping, and fitting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; only internal calculations and visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; influence functions are standard Gaussian models.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.0, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a thorough, accurate assessment. The code performs typical influence function generation and wavefront fitting without any suspicious behavior. The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's focus and data sources, including wavefront maps and actuator support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through fitting routines; no external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns; influence functions are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard adaptive optics implementation with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.2 is slightly conservative, considering the code's benign nature. No actual malicious activity is detected. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the influence function creation, coordinate mapping, and fitting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from input arrays through influence functions to fitting matrices; no external leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns; standard Gaussian influence functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical implementation for deformable mirror control.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low security risk score is justified. The code is straightforward and scientific, with no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description; influence functions generated via Gaussian models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard optical modeling code; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scoring is consistent; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the influence function generation, coordinate mapping, and fitting routines.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data is processed internally; no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate scientific implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, SecurityRisk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.2 is cautious but reasonable, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's straightforward scientific purpose.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risks:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about data misuse, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to the potential misuse of influence matrices or actuator data if accessed maliciously, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual content. The influence functions are generated via standard Gaussian models, and the code performs typical adaptive optics calculations. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard scientific code with minimal security concern.",
