  "purpose": "Define a Python class for managing Laser Guide Star Wavefront Sensor (LGS WFS) parameters with validation and dynamic adjustment based on guide star configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from dictionaries, including 'lgs_wfs_parameters' for parameters and other nested configurations for atmosphere and asterism.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly validates and stores configuration parameters and adjusts internal arrays accordingly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration dictionaries into class attributes; arrays are resized based on 'nLGS' changes, with validation steps ensuring data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard validation and array management. No external network calls or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly validates input types and values for physical parameters, dynamically adjusts internal arrays when 'nLGS' changes, and provides string representation for inspection. It imports numpy and other modules, but these are used for array management and validation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident; the logic is straightforward, focusing on parameter validation and configuration management. The example usage demonstrates typical class usage with configuration dictionaries and parameter adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management class for a scientific instrument, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and array management securely. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
