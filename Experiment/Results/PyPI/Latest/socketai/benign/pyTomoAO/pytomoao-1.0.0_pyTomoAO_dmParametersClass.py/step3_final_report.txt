  "purpose": "Manage and validate deformable mirror parameters including heights, actuator spacing, cross-coupling, actuator counts, and valid actuator maps.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary input, specifically 'dm_parameters' subkeys such as dmHeights, dmPitch, dmCrossCoupling, nActuators, validActuators",
  "sinks": "Internal storage of validated arrays and parameters; no external data sinks or system interactions observed",
  "flows": "Input data from configuration -> validation and conversion -> internal attribute assignment -> data representation and display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation routines, converting inputs to numpy arrays, checking bounds, and managing actuator maps with padding. It encapsulates parameters with getters and setters, ensuring data integrity. No network, system, or file operations are present. The code is well-structured, with clear validation and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The example usage demonstrates typical parameter initialization. Validation routines are appropriate and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured parameter management class for deformable mirrors. It performs thorough validation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The data flow is internal and safe, with no external system interactions. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
