{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing deformable mirror (DM) parameters, including validation and data handling for actuator configurations, mirror heights, and related parameters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the configuration dictionary passed during initialization, specifically from 'dm_parameters' keys such as 'dmHeights', 'dmPitch', 'dmCrossCoupling', 'nActuators', and 'validActuators'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data leading to potential data leaks or malicious effects. No system commands, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the config dictionary into the class properties through validation setters; no external untrusted input flows to critical system functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code is present. The code performs standard validation and data encapsulation. No backdoors, system manipulations, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class for handling DM parameters with thorough validation, including array conversion, bounds checks, and shape validation. It employs numpy for numerical operations and enforces data integrity. The example usage shows standard initialization from a dictionary and printing of parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not contain network operations, system modifications, or hidden behaviors. All operations appear legitimate and intended for configuring hardware parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate configuration class for deformable mirror parameters with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It strictly performs data validation and encapsulation without performing any suspicious or harmful actions.",
