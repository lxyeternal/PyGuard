{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling deformable mirror parameters, including validation and representation, primarily for use in optical systems or adaptive optics control.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the configuration dictionary passed during instantiation, specifically from 'dm_parameters' keys: 'dmHeights', 'dmPitch', 'dmCrossCoupling', 'nActuators', and 'validActuators'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any direct sinks like network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted code; it primarily processes and validates input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the configuration dictionary into class properties, with validation steps ensuring correctness. There are no indications of data being sent elsewhere or being maliciously manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with standard validation and array manipulations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, network access, or file operations are included.",
  "analysis": "The code securely converts input data to numpy arrays, performs validation checks for data types and value ranges, and manages actuator maps with padding. No operations perform network access, system modification, or other malicious actions. The purpose is purely to encapsulate and validate parameters for an optical system. The presence of input validation and data encapsulation reduces risk of malicious behavior. The example usage shows typical initialization with no malicious content. Overall, the code does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard parameter management class for deformable mirrors, with proper validation and data handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
