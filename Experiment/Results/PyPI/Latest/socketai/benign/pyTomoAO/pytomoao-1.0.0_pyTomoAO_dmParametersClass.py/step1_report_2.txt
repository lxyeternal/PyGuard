{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing and validating deformable mirror (DM) parameters, including actuator configurations, mirror heights, and cross-coupling coefficients.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration dictionary input for DM parameters, including lists and arrays such as dmHeights, dmPitch, nActuators, validActuators.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (configuration dict) -> validation and conversion in setters -> storage in private variables -> retrieval for display and processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of numpy for array handling is standard and justified.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with various properties related to DM parameters, performing validation on input types and values. It uses numpy arrays for numerical operations and includes support for padding actuator maps. No external network, file, or system commands are used. The code structure and methods are consistent with standard data validation and encapsulation practices. The example usage demonstrates typical instantiation and usage without malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for managing DM parameters with proper validation and data encapsulation. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified. It is safe and aligns with intended functionality.",
