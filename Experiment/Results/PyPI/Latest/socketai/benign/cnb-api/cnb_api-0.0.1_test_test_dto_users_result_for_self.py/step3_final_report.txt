  "purpose": "Auto-generated unit test scaffold for the DtoUsersResultForSelf data model, serving as a template for future tests.",
  "sources": "Commented-out code for instance creation, class imports, and test method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external input, or output involved.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; code is static and non-executing in its current state.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out instance creation code; no active logic or data handling; standard autogenerated template.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, autogenerated test scaffold with no active logic, data flows, or external interactions. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The commented-out instance creation code is typical in such templates and does not execute. The test method is a placeholder and does not perform any tests. Overall, the code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, autogenerated test scaffold with no security concerns. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. No modifications are necessary.",
