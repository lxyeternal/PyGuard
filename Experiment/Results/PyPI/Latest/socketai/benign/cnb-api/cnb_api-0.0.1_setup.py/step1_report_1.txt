{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'cnb-api'. It is intended to package and distribute the library via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The source of input/data includes the static package metadata, dependencies specified in 'REQUIRES', and the package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way, such as executing system commands, writing files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static metadata and dependencies into the setup() function, which configures the package; no external untrusted data inputs are processed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and package data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or input handling is present. The comments and structure are typical for generated setup files, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
