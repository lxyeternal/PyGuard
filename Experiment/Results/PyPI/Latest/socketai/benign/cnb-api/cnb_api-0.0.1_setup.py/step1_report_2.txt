{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'cnb-api' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the package metadata (name, version, author info), dependency list (REQUIRES), and package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the setup() function which writes package configuration for installation. No untrusted input is directly used in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "The static package metadata and dependency list flow into the setup() function to define package installation behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define package installation parameters. It specifies package dependencies, metadata, and package inclusion rules. No input data is read from external or untrusted sources at runtime; all values are hardcoded. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The comments and structure are typical for a Python package setup file. The script appears benign and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It follows standard packaging conventions without any suspicious or harmful code elements.",
