  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'cnb-api' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants (NAME, VERSION, PYTHON_REQUIRES, REQUIRES), imported modules (setuptools).",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call that initiates package installation.",
  "flows": "Constants and imports are used directly in setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script generated by OpenAPI Generator. It defines package metadata and dependencies without executing any runtime logic, network calls, or malicious actions. The code is clean, straightforward, and adheres to common packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. All dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It contains no sensitive information, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears safe and legitimate.",
