  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'cnb-api', generated by OpenAPI Generator, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, requirements), reading package data files, and executing setup() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() which installs the package; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and dependencies are defined and passed to setup(), with no user input or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines package metadata and dependencies, and calls setup() with proper parameters. It is a typical package setup script generated automatically, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All dependencies are explicitly listed and standard. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use and deploy.",
