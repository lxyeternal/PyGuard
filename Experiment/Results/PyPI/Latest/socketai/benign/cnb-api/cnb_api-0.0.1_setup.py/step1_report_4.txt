  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'cnb-api'.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables (NAME, VERSION, PYTHON_REQUIRES, REQUIRES), and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which processes the package configuration data.",
  "flows": "Data from variables (e.g., NAME, VERSION, REQUIRES) flows into setup() arguments, which are used to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code strictly adheres to standard Python package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration, then invokes setup(). No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used. There are no obfuscated or malicious code segments; the code appears to be boilerplate for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves solely to configure package installation without any suspicious behaviors or malicious code.",
