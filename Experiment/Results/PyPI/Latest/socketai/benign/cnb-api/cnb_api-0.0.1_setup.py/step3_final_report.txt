  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script generated by OpenAPI Generator for packaging the 'cnb-api' library.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and configuration data defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from variable definitions into the setup() function without dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script typical for Python packages. It contains no runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code. All dependencies and metadata are explicitly defined and standard. The code's structure and comments are typical for such generated scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious or security concerns. All review reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
