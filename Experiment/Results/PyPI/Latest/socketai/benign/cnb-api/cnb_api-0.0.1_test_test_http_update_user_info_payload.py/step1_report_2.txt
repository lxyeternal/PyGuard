  "purpose": "This code defines a unit test class for the HttpUpdateUserInfoPayload model, intended for testing the creation of instances with required and optional parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement for HttpUpdateUserInfoPayload from cnb_api.models; no external input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is solely defining a test structure without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly commented-out test code; no suspicious or unusual logic, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test stub for a data model, generated by OpenAPI generator. It contains no active logic, data processing, or external communications. The commented code suggests potential instance creation with optional parameters but does not execute. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test template with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines a test structure for a data model without executing any data flow or external interaction.",
