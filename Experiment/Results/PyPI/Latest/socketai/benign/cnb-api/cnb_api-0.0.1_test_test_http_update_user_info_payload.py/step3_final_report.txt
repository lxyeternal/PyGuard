  "purpose": "Auto-generated unit test scaffold for the HttpUpdateUserInfoPayload data model, serving as a template for future tests.",
  "sources": "No active data sources; commented-out code indicates placeholders for data input or object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; all code is inactive or commented out, with no execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code for instance creation; no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no active logic, external data handling, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as a safe, boilerplate template. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, auto-generated unit test stub with no malicious or security concerns. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
