{
  "purpose": "The code provides templates and utility functions for setting up and processing molecular simulation workflows, including QM/MM and MD simulations, as well as data processing scripts.",
  "sources": "File writing functions, predefined string templates, external command invocations (e.g., cpptraj, bash scripts)",
  "sinks": "External scripts and commands executed, file outputs (e.g., .sh, .dat, .pdb, .nc files)",
  "flows": "Templates and functions generate scripts that invoke external tools; no dynamic or untrusted input flows into critical operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string templates and straightforward file I/O functions. It invokes standard external tools used in computational chemistry workflows. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scripts perform typical setup, cleanup, and data processing tasks without dynamic or malicious behavior. External commands like 'cpptraj' and bash scripts are standard in the domain. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, domain-specific automation scripts for molecular simulations. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
