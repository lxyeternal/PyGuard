{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate configuration files, scripts, and input data for molecular dynamics (MD) and QM/MM simulations, likely used in computational chemistry workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; all data is hardcoded within string variables and file names are parameters for writing files.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to files such as shell scripts, input parameter files, and data files; these could potentially be executed or misused if manipulated externally, but no unsafe commands or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows into the code; data flows from hardcoded strings and parameters to file outputs, which may be later executed or used in external environments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code only performs file I/O operations. Functions are straightforward and do not include obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script contains multiple string variables representing configuration files and bash scripts for molecular simulations. It includes functions to generate shell scripts that write specific input data for simulations, which could be used in automated workflows. No external input is accepted; all data is predefined. The code lacks any network activity, system commands, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for preparing and cleaning simulation data, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions and string templates for simulation setup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It is a legitimate supporting script for computational workflows.",
