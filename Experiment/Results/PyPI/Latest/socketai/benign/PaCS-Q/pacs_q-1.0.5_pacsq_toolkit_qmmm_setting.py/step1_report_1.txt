  "purpose": "The code provides templates and functions for running QM/MM and MD simulations, generating input scripts, and handling related files.",
  "sources": [
    "File reading in read_dat() function",
    "String variables containing script templates (qmmm_tem, qmmm_tem_s, md_tem_s, bo, cpp, pdb_last, clean, qmset)"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "write_to_sh() writes simulation setup commands to a file",
    "write_to_dat() writes provided text to a file",
    "read_dat() reads data from a specified file"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "External data (file contents) is read via read_dat()",
    "User-provided or template strings are written to files via write_to_sh() and write_to_dat()"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features",
    "File deletion commands (rm) in clean script are typical cleanup steps",
    "No suspicious network or system calls, no reverse shells or data exfiltration code",
    "No embedded malicious scripts or code execution outside standard file operations"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of predefined string templates for simulation input files and utility functions to write these templates or read files. The functions are straightforward file I/O operations without any dynamic or unsafe code execution. The scripts and functions appear to be designed for setting up and processing molecular simulations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. The presence of cleanup scripts and simulation setup code is typical for scientific workflows. No anomalous or suspicious code elements are detected. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on simulation input management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utilities and templates for molecular simulation workflows. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The functions perform standard file read/write operations without any hidden or malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
