{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate input scripts and shell scripts for molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, and includes functions to write and read data files related to these simulations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from variables and writes to files; reads content from specified data files using read_dat() function.",
  "sinks": "Writes to shell script files (.sh), data files (.dat), and input files for simulation programs. Reads from specified data files.",
  "flows": "Data is generated or read from internal variables, then written to files used in simulations. No evident flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and primarily handles file I/O for simulation workflows. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines static string templates for simulation input files, shell scripts, and functions for file writing and reading. It does not include any network operations, data exfiltration, or system commands that could be malicious. All functions perform standard file I/O operations. The use of 'write_to_sh', 'write_to_dat', and 'read_dat' functions is consistent with normal script generation for scientific workflows. No suspicious patterns such as command injection, data leaks, or hidden malicious behavior are found. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate simulation setup activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility script for preparing and managing input/output files for MD and QM/MM simulations. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate scientific automation tasks.",
