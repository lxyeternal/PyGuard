{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and manage input scripts and data files for molecular dynamics simulations, specifically QM/MM and MD simulations, as well as some preprocessing and postprocessing scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading input files via read_dat(), writing scripts and input data files through write_to_sh(), write_to_dat(), and predefined script strings; possibly reading or writing trajectory data files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell scripts (bash scripts) that invoke external programs such as cpptraj, potentially handling trajectory and configuration files; no direct network or system access observed.",
  "flows": "User-provided data read via read_dat() feeds into file writing functions, which generate scripts and input files; these scripts are then executed externally, but the code itself does not execute these commands directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The shell script contents are straightforward, mainly for file manipulation and external tool invocation. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages text templates for simulation input files and shell scripts, with functions to write and read these files. It leverages string formatting for input generation, and simple file I/O functions. No suspicious code injection, network activity, or malicious data handling observed. The external commands (cpptraj, bash scripts) are typical for molecular simulation workflows and do not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate scientific computing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of scripts and functions for preparing, processing, and analyzing molecular simulation data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It seems to be a legitimate automation utility for scientific workflows.",
