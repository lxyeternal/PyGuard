{
  "purpose": "The script performs analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories by calculating distances between selected atoms across multiple simulation files, utilizing multiprocessing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Reads trajectory files (.nc), topology files (.top), and user-provided selection criteria from command-line arguments; also reads and writes data files specified by user.",
  "sinks": "Writes distance data to a user-specified output file; uses user inputs for selections and filenames which could be manipulated if not validated.",
  "flows": "User input arguments → File searching functions → Data processing functions → Distance calculations → Output file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity; code structure is typical for scientific data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries (MDAnalysis, tqdm, os, re, argparse, multiprocessing) for trajectory analysis. It searches for trajectory (.nc) and topology (.top) files in specified directories, sorts them based on regex-extracted numbers, and calculates atom-atom distances across files, employing multiprocessing to parallelize work. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious external communications are present. User inputs are used directly for file paths and selection strings, which is typical for configurable scripts but should ideally include validation to prevent injection or errors. The script writes results to a specified output file without apparent malicious intent. The functions and flow are typical of a molecular analysis pipeline. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific analysis script for molecular dynamics data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected file handling, data processing, and output generation, all aligned with its purpose. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
