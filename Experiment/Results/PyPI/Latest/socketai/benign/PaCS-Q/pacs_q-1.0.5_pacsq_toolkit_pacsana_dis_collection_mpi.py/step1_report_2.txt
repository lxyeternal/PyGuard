{
  "purpose": "The script performs molecular dynamics trajectory analysis by calculating distances between selected atoms across multiple simulation files, with support for parallel processing and file handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from command-line arguments, searches directories for '.nc' and '.top' files, and reads data from these files during trajectory processing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs distance data to a specified file; no other sinks or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file paths and selections) are used to locate files, which are then processed to compute distances. Data flows from input parameters through file searches and trajectory analysis, culminating in writing numerical results to an output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are detected. File searches rely on regex pattern matching, which is standard. The use of multiprocessing is typical for performance enhancement. No backdoors, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically searches for '.nc' and '.top' files, sorts them based on a regex-extracted key, and computes atomic distances using MDAnalysis. It supports parallel processing to handle multiple files efficiently. The logic appears consistent with scientific data analysis. No suspicious or malicious constructs such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code functions solely within data processing boundaries, and all external interactions are benign and limited to file I/O. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis script without malicious intent. It performs standard file handling, trajectory analysis, and multiprocessing for performance. There are no indicators of malware, sabotage, or malicious data leakage.",
