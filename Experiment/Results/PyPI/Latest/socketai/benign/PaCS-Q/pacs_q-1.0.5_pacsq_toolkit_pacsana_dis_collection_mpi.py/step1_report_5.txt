{
  "purpose": "The script performs trajectory analysis by calculating distances between selected atoms across molecular dynamics simulation files, supporting parallel processing and file handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input arguments from command line; reads files with specific extensions (.nc, .top) from directories; loads trajectory and topology files using MDAnalysis.",
  "sinks": "Writes distance data to an output file specified by user; loads files from disk; potentially processes untrusted input in selection strings.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and used to locate files; selected files are sorted and loaded; distances are computed per trajectory frame; results are accumulated and saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. Usage of regex for filename parsing is straightforward. No obfuscated code detected. The script's structure and logic are typical for scientific data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries for file handling, parallel processing, and scientific computation. It uses MDAnalysis for trajectory analysis, with functions to find files, sort them, and process them either sequentially or in parallel. No suspicious code patterns, such as network calls, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. The only potential concern is processing untrusted selection strings directly, but this is a typical feature of MDAnalysis scripts and not inherently malicious. The code does not contain any obfuscated logic, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific data analysis script with no signs of malicious intent. It processes trajectory data, performs distance calculations, and saves results. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
