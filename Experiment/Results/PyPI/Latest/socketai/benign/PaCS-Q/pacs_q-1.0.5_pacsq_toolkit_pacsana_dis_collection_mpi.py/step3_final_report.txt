  "purpose": "Scientific analysis of MD trajectories, calculating distances between selected atoms across multiple files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for file paths and selection strings, directory traversal for '.nc' and '.top' files.",
  "sinks": "Writing numerical distance data directly to a user-specified output file.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> File search functions -> File sorting via regex -> MDAnalysis universe creation -> Atom selection -> Distance calculation per frame -> Data collection -> Output file writing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of user-provided selection strings directly in MDAnalysis functions without validation; no network activity or obfuscation; straightforward scientific code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal to find trajectory and topology files, sorts files based on regex-extracted numeric patterns, loads files with MDAnalysis, calculates inter-atom distances across frames, supports multiprocessing, and writes results to a specified file. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of selection strings directly could pose a risk if inputs are malicious, but this is typical in scientific scripts. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate scientific analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign scientific data analysis tool with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for misuse due to unvalidated user inputs but no malicious activity.",
