  "purpose": "The script processes molecular dynamics trajectory data, manipulates PDB structures, adds hydrogen atoms based on geometric calculations, and generates input files for quantum chemistry calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads trajectory files (.nc), topology files (.top), and PDB files ('edited.pdb', '{frame_index}_split.pdb') from the filesystem; reads command-line arguments for input filenames and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files: 'frame_{args.frame}.pdb', 'edited.pdb', '{frame_index}_split.pdb', and '{frame_index}.inp'. The code also prints information to the console.",
  "flows": "Reads trajectory and topology data, performs geometric computations, modifies molecular structure, and writes modified PDB files. Coordinates are used to generate Gaussian input files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. Warnings are suppressed, which might hide potential issues but is standard for scientific code. No external network communication, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard molecular data processing, geometric calculations for hydrogen placement, and file generation. It uses well-known libraries (MDAnalysis, BioPython) and typical scientific workflows. No obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or malicious file modifications are evident. Warnings are suppressed for benign reasons related to scientific data handling. No anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a scientific utility for molecular modeling and quantum chemistry input generation, with no indications of malicious intent. It processes and writes data in a typical manner, with no suspicious external communication or system sabotage.",
