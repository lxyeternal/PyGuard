{
  "purpose": "The code manages a molecular simulation workflow, executing multiple cycles and repetitions, handling directory and file management, and invoking external tools such as sander and cpptraj.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (e.g., qmmm.crd, qmmm.top, reference pdb), and internal variables for script templates and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() calls to execute shell commands, create directories, and run external programs; writes log and data files.",
  "flows": "Sources (input files and variables) feed into system commands via string interpolation; outputs include simulation data, logs, and script files; external commands are invoked with these interpolated strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reliance on os.system() with string formatting is a potential security concern but appears controlled; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate scientific automation, with external command execution being the main security vector. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The use of os.system() with interpolated strings could pose command injection risks if inputs are untrusted, but inputs seem controlled. The code is clear and readable, with no obfuscation. The malware score is justified as 0, and obfuscation as 0. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3), reflecting the potential for command injection if inputs are compromised. Overall, the code is low risk and intended for scientific purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific workflow automation script with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the use of os.system() with dynamic strings, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3. To improve security, replacing os.system() with subprocess.run() with argument lists and input validation is recommended.",
