  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific workflow automation script with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the use of os.system() with dynamic strings, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3. To improve security, replacing os.system() with subprocess.run() with argument lists and input validation is recommended."
