  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific wrapper for executing external 'sander' commands. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated input parameters. Implementing input validation or sanitization would reduce this risk. Current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) due to the potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted."
