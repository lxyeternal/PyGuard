  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific automation script for molecular dynamics workflows. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware. The main security consideration is the use of os.system without input validation, which should be addressed in production environments. Overall, the code is benign with low security risk."
