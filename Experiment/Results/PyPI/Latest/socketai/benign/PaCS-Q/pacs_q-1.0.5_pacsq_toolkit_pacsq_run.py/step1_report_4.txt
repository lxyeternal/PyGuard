{
  "purpose": "The code automates running a series of molecular dynamics simulations using external tools, managing input/output files and directory structures.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.getcwd()), external scripts (write_to_dat, write_to_sh), input files (crd, top, qmmm_int), and system commands (os.system calls).",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to execute shell commands, including directory creation, running simulation executables (sander_run_mpi, sander_run_mpi_cyc), and script execution (cpptraj).",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., qmmm_int, environment variables) flows into file writes and os.system calls. External simulation commands and scripts are invoked based on computed parameters, with data potentially written or read at multiple steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets. Use of os.system could be risky if input strings are not sanitized, but here inputs are mostly from local variables or files. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected. Directory and file management seems standard for simulation workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform typical molecular simulation automation: creating directories, writing configuration files, executing external simulation tools, and processing outputs. All system calls use controlled inputs derived from the script's variables and files. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of os.system is common in scripting workflows, but could be a security concern if inputs were derived from untrusted sources; here, inputs are internal or predefined. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code’s structure and functions are typical for computational chemistry pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The script automates molecular dynamics workflows without signs of malicious behavior. It uses external tools and file management typical for such tasks. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are identified. While use of os.system warrants caution, in this context, it appears to be used safely with controlled inputs.",
