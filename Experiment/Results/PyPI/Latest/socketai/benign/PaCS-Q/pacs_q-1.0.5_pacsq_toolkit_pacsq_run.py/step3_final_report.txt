{
  "purpose": "This code orchestrates molecular dynamics simulations by managing directories, preparing input files, and executing external tools such as sander and cpptraj. It automates iterative cycles with reference minimization based on RMSD calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (e.g., qmmm.crd, qmmm.top, reference pdb), configuration data (e.g., qmmm_tem), and parameters passed to the function (cyc, rep, foldername, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Executes shell commands via os.system (creating directories, running simulations, processing trajectories), which could potentially execute untrusted commands if inputs are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, files) are used to construct shell commands and file operations; these commands are executed through os.system, affecting the filesystem and running external simulation programs.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of os.system without input sanitization; no validation of external parameters; commented-out code and print statements are benign; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script manages simulation workflows by creating directories, writing input files, and executing external programs. The primary security concern is the reliance on os.system with dynamically constructed commands, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears standard for scientific automation, with scores reflecting low risk. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by the use of os.system without sanitization but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific automation script for molecular dynamics workflows. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware. The main security consideration is the use of os.system without input validation, which should be addressed in production environments. Overall, the code is benign with low security risk.",
