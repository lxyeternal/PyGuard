  "purpose": "This script automates molecular dynamics simulations involving QMMM calculations and cycle iterations, including file management, running external programs, and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (e.g., qmmm_int, qmmm.crd, qmmm.top, ref_location), environment variables, and external commands via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executes external commands (os.system) that run simulation tools and scripts; writes output files such as sum-all.sh, dis.dat, dis_plot.dat, and logs.",
  "flows": "Source data (e.g., input files, selection parameters) flows into commands and scripts executed via os.system, influencing simulation execution and data logging.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system extensively without sanitization, dynamically writes and executes shell commands, which could be manipulated. No explicit hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code automates molecular simulation workflows, writing configuration files, creating directories, and executing external programs like sander_run_mpi and cpptraj through os.system. It reads some input files and generates shell scripts. The extensive use of os.system with dynamic command construction without validation poses potential security concerns, especially if input files or parameters are externally controlled. However, no clear malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The code appears to serve legitimate scientific purposes with no obvious malicious intent. Its behavior could be misused if input files or parameters are compromised, but this is typical for automation scripts in scientific computing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate automation of molecular simulations. Although it relies heavily on os.system with dynamically generated commands, no direct evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads, is present. Its security risk is low but should be reviewed for input validation if inputs are externally supplied.",
