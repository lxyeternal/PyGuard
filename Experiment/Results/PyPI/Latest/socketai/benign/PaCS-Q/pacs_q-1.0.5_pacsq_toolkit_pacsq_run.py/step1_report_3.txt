  "purpose": "The code appears to orchestrate molecular dynamics simulations using external tools and scripts, managing directories, input files, and executing commands for simulations and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and input data from external files and variables (e.g., qmmm_tem, cpp, bo, clean, pdb_last, qmmm_int). Reads and writes files such as .sh, .dat, and .nc files. Executes system commands via os.system, including directory creation, file execution, and data processing.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands which invoke external simulation software (sander_run_mpi, sander_run_mpi_cyc), and calls cpptraj, which may process or analyze data. Writes to files that may contain sensitive data, logs, or command scripts.",
  "flows": "Source: External input/config files -> Processed into command scripts and input files -> System commands run external simulation tools and scripts -> Results stored in files and directories.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses os.system extensively, which is typical in scripting but can be risky if inputs are untrusted. The code does not sanitize input filenames or commands, which could be exploited if malicious files are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No indications of code designed to exfiltrate data or establish backdoors. Commented out code and print statements are present but benign.",
  "analysis": "The script manages simulation workflows by creating directories, generating input files, and executing external tools. It reads input parameters and configuration files, then automates the execution of simulation cycles. The use of os.system for executing commands is standard in such scripts, though it can pose security risks if inputs are compromised. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or reverse shells. The code structure and logic are consistent with typical simulation orchestration. No suspicious network activity, hidden processes, or backdoors are evident. Overall, the script performs legitimate automation of molecular dynamics workflows without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an automation script for molecular dynamics simulations, involving directory management, input file generation, and execution of simulation software. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The use of os.system is typical but warrants caution if inputs are untrusted. The script appears to be benign and intended for scientific computation workflows.",
