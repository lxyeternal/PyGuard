{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on static analysis signals.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, network calls, environment variable usage, and file operations within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or data leaks where untrusted data could cause harm or information exposure.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file systems, potentially enabling malicious actions if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns include hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution constructs; none are detected in the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either benign, minimal, or absent, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the absence of malicious activity, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting cautious consideration of potential data flow concerns but no concrete threats. Confidence levels are high where code exists and straightforward, slightly lower when code is absent or minimal. Overall, the assessments are conservative, justified, and aligned with the static analysis signals.",
  "conclusion": "The reports accurately identify the benign nature of the code, with appropriate scoring for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No revisions are necessary; the assessments are consistent and well-founded.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
