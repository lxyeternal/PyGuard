{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a demonstration or utility script related to cybersecurity analysis, specifically designed to evaluate Python packages for malicious behavior and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, and potentially reads external data (though no explicit input functions are visible).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that could execute code, send data over network connections, or access sensitive information, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are observable in the code snippet, as the code does not process user input or external data explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no evident anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code structure appears straightforward, with standard imports and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily consisting of imports and possibly a utility function. No malicious or suspicious constructs are evident. The absence of input processing, network activity, or secret handling suggests no malicious intent. The code does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies identified.",
