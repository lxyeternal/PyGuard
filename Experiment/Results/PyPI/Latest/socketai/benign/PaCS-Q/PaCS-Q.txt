The primary security concern is the use of os.system() with dynamic strings, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3. To improve security, replacing os.system() with subprocess.run() with argument lists and input validation is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific wrapper for executing external 'sander' commands. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection due to unvalidated input parameters. Implementing input validation or sanitization would reduce this risk. Current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) due to the potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted."

No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are evident. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the overall security risk is very low (0.1), primarily due to warnings suppression which is common in such workflows."

The main security consideration is the use of os.system without input validation, which should be addressed in production environments. Overall, the code is benign with low security risk."
