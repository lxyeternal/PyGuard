  "purpose": "The script processes molecular dynamics trajectory files, modifies molecular structures by adding hydrogens based on ideal tetrahedral geometry, and prepares input files for quantum chemistry calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads trajectory data from specified files, reads and parses PDB files, user input parameters via command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes PDB files, Gaussian input files (.gjf), and logs to the console.",
  "flows": "Trajectory and structure data are read; structural modifications are performed; hydrogen atoms are added; output files are generated. Data flows from input files to modifications and then to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Warnings are suppressed, but this is standard for scientific code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. All operations are standard molecular modeling procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs molecular structure manipulation and file I/O operations. It reads trajectory and PDB data, modifies the structure by adding hydrogen atoms based on ideal tetrahedral orientations, and generates input files for quantum calculations. It suppresses non-critical warnings, which is typical in scientific computations. No code injection, malicious network activity, or privacy violations are present. All third-party libraries are used for legitimate scientific purposes, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate scientific tool designed for molecular modeling and quantum chemistry input preparation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious sections. It poses no security threat based on the analyzed content.",
