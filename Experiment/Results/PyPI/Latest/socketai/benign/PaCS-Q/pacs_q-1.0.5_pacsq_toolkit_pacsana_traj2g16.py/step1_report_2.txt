{
  "purpose": "The script processes molecular structure files (PDB), performs hydrogen placement based on idealized tetrahedral geometry, and generates modified PDB, Gaussian input files, and performs structural analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified via command-line arguments (--top, --nc, --frame, --selection), and reads/writes PDB files (edited.pdb, frame_{frame}.pdb, {frame}.gjf).",
  "sinks": "Writes output files (PDB, Gaussian input) and appends hydrogen atoms to residues; does not execute network connections or modify environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads structure files -> performs calculations and modifications -> writes new PDB files -> extracts coordinates -> writes Gaussian input files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls, and no use of unsafe evaluation or code injection methods. Warnings suppressed do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads molecular structure files, processes residues to add hydrogen atoms based on geometric calculations, and generates output files. The use of standard libraries (BioPython, MDAnalysis, numpy) and typical file operations suggests routine computational chemistry tasks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. Warning suppression and detailed logging relate to benign scientific processing. The code does not include any obfuscated constructs or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform legitimate molecular modeling operations without any signs of malicious behavior. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected. The primary functions involve structural modification and file generation typical of computational chemistry workflows.",
