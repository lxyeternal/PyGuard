  "purpose": "The script processes molecular dynamics data: extracts frames from trajectories, manipulates PDB structures by adding hydrogens, aligns molecules, and generates input files for quantum chemistry calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by command-line arguments (-n, -t), reads and parses PDB files ('edited.pdb', '{frame}_split.pdb'), and retrieves atomic data from the MDAnalysis universe.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files: {frame}_split.pdb (modified structure), {frame}.gjf (Gaussian input), and {frame}_pdb.pdb (trajectory frame snapshot).",
  "flows": "Loads structure from input files → modifies structure by adding hydrogens → saves modified structure to file → reads structure again for coordinate extraction → generates Gaussian input file with constrained CA atoms.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains debug print statements (e.g., 'find CA atom index {i} should be constrained') but no hidden or suspicious code. Warnings are suppressed explicitly. No hardcoded credentials or network activity present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution mechanisms are detected. The comments and code flow are consistent with scientific computation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard molecular structure processing: reading PDB files, selecting atoms, computing rotations, adding hydrogens, and writing output files. It uses well-known libraries (BioPython, MDAnalysis) and standard practices. No indications of malicious actions like network communication, system commands, or data exfiltration are present. Warnings are suppressed legitimately for known library issues. The addition of hydrogens and creation of Gaussian input files are typical in computational chemistry workflows. The code appears to be designed for scientific research purposes with no evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malware functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical scientific processing script for molecular data with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It performs data parsing, structure modification, and file generation for computational chemistry without any malicious side effects.",
