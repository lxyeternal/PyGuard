{
  "purpose": "The code implements a convolutional neural network to classify MNIST handwritten digit images using TensorFlow/Keras and visualizes results with matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from MNIST dataset via tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). Uses model.predict() to generate predictions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include plotting the confusion matrix, printing test accuracy, and classification report. No untrusted data handling or sensitive information leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from trusted datasets, processed internally, and results are displayed or printed. No external data or untrusted inputs are utilized or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a standard dataset, preprocesses data, defines and trains a common CNN model, and visualizes the results. All operations are typical for ML model evaluation. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard machine learning workflow for MNIST digit classification. No malicious or suspicious activity identified. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
