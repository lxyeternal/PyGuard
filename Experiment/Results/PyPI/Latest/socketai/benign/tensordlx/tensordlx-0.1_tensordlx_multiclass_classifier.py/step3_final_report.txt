{
  "purpose": "Standard implementation of a CNN classifier for MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Data loaded from keras.datasets (mnist.load_data()), input data processed in code.",
  "sinks": "Visualization with matplotlib, model evaluation; no external data transmission or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading, preprocessing, through model training, to evaluation and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured ML pipeline for image classification. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no network activity beyond local visualization, no suspicious data handling, and no obfuscation. All signals point to benign, typical ML code. No logical flaws or security issues are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network attacks. The data sources are trusted, and the data flows are standard. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an MNIST classifier with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
