  "purpose": "This code trains and evaluates a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying MNIST handwritten digits.",
  "sources": "Data is loaded from the tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist module; input data is read from the dataset.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots, classification reports, and evaluation metrics, but no untrusted data is sent or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset -> preprocessed -> fed into the model -> predictions are generated -> evaluation metrics are computed and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses standard libraries and methods for ML tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing libraries and loading the MNIST dataset. It preprocesses data for training. A CNN model is constructed with standard layers, compiled, and trained for 5 epochs. After training, predictions are made on test data, and confusion matrix and classification report are generated for evaluation. The process involves typical ML workflow with visualization and metric output. No external network calls, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate example of an image classification task with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an MNIST classifier using TensorFlow/Keras. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It is a typical ML code example for educational or demonstration purposes.",
