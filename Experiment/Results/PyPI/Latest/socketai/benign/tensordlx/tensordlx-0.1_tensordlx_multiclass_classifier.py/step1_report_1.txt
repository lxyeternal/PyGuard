  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification.",
  "sources": "Reads MNIST dataset from keras.datasets, loads prediction data, and outputs results with matplotlib and sklearn metrics.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sinks like network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading -> preprocessing -> model training -> prediction -> evaluation and plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard TensorFlow/Keras implementation for MNIST digit classification, including data loading, model building, training, and evaluation. No external inputs, network communications, or suspicious activities are present. The code does not perform any potentially malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network attacks. Usage of well-known libraries and straightforward flow indicates typical usage without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard machine learning script for digit classification with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
