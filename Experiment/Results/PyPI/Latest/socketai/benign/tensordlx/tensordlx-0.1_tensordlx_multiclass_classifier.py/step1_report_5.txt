{
  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a convolutional neural network for classifying MNIST handwritten digit images.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the MNIST dataset via keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). Uses numpy and matplotlib for data processing and visualization.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printing the test accuracy, classification report, and displaying a confusion matrix plot. No data is sent over the network or written to external files outside visualization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset loading into preprocessing, then into the model training and prediction stages. Predicted labels are used for generating confusion matrix and classification report, with visualization handled locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears standard for a typical deep learning classification task. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses image data, builds a CNN model with standard layers, trains for 5 epochs, and then evaluates and visualizes results. All operations are typical for machine learning workflows. No external network connections are made outside standard library functions. No suspicious data handling, no dynamic code execution, no embedded malicious scripts, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward CNN training and evaluation pipeline for MNIST data. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate example of deep learning model implementation with no supply chain or security concerns.",
