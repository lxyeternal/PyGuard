{
  "purpose": "Train and evaluate a CNN model on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.",
  "sources": "Data loaded from keras.datasets.mnist; model inputs from preprocessed image data.",
  "sinks": "Model training and evaluation; display of confusion matrix and classification report; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Data loading -> preprocessing -> model training -> prediction -> evaluation and visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries for ML tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a well-known dataset (MNIST), preprocesses images, defines a CNN model, trains the model, and evaluates it with standard metrics. All steps are typical for ML workflows. No suspicious network activity, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors. External libraries are used in conventional ways. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard machine learning task without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign example of training and evaluating an image classifier on MNIST dataset.",
