{
  "purpose": "This code performs sentiment analysis using an LSTM model on the IMDb dataset for text classification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the IMDb dataset via keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(), accesses the word index with imdb.get_word_index(), and processes input sequences for model training.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data over the network, write to system files, or execute untrusted input directly. The main sink is model training and printing decoded review text.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are loaded and decoded; data is processed with padding, then fed into the model for training. The only output is printed decoded text.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external network activity are present. The code appears to follow standard practices for dataset loading, decoding, and model training.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras), loads the IMDb dataset, processes data with padding, decodes one review, and trains an LSTM model for sentiment analysis. All steps use standard API calls without any suspicious modifications, hidden functions, or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of common machine learning procedures suggests legitimate functionality. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a sentiment analysis model using LSTM on IMDb dataset. It contains no malicious or suspicious code elements. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
