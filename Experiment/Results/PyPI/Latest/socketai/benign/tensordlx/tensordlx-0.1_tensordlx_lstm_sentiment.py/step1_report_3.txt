{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class to display a script that performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using a neural network with LSTM.",
  "sources": "Reads IMDB dataset via keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(), retrieves word index via imdb.get_word_index(), and reads data from the dataset.",
  "sinks": "Processes data through neural network layers; no external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident. The only output is printed decoded review text.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset, processed into sequences, decoded for display, then fed into a neural network for training. No external data flow or malicious data handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for sentiment analysis. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The model training is typical; no malicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads IMDB data, decodes a sample review, then builds and trains an LSTM-based neural network for sentiment classification. All steps use well-known libraries and standard practices. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears benign and intended for model training and evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sentiment analysis implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
