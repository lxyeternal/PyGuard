{
  "purpose": "This code defines and trains an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model on the IMDB dataset.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset from tensorflow.keras.datasets.imdb, loads word index, and input data for training and testing.",
  "sinks": "Model training, print statements for decoded review, and data loading functions; no direct data leakage or untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from standard datasets, decoded for display, and used to train a model; no untrusted external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard sentiment analysis pipeline. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for NLP and deep learning, loads the IMDB dataset with a fixed vocabulary size, processes input sequences with padding, constructs a neural network model with embedding and LSTM layers, and trains the model. The decode_review function translates numerical reviews back to text for display. All operations are consistent with typical sentiment analysis workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model without malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data loading, preprocessing, model creation, and training in a typical manner.",
