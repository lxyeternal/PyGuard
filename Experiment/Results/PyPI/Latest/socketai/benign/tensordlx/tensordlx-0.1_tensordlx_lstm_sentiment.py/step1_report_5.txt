{
  "purpose": "Build and train an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset.",
  "sources": "Loading dataset with imdb.load_data(), reading dataset from keras.datasets.imdb, obtaining word index, decoding review with decode_review().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file I/O, or environment variable usage are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Dataset loading (source) -> Data preprocessing -> Model training (sink). No suspicious data flows outside typical ML pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a sentiment analysis model with no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for NLP and ML, loads a public dataset, preprocesses the data, decodes a sample review, builds a neural network model, and trains it. No external data leaks, no network connections, no data exfiltration, and no code injection or backdoors are evident. The decoding function is typical for dataset inspection. The model setup and training process follow standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an NLP sentiment analysis model without any malicious behavior or security risks. It only processes public dataset and trains a model locally. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
