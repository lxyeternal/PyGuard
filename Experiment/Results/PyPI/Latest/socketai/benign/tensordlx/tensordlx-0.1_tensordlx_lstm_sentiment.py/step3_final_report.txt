  "purpose": "Standard sentiment analysis implementation using LSTM on the IMDB dataset for training and decoding reviews.",
  "sources": "imdb.load_data(), imdb.get_word_index(), decode_review() function, data preprocessing steps",
  "sinks": "print(decoded) (displaying decoded review), model training process (local resource use)",
  "flows": "load_data() -> get_word_index() -> decode_review() -> print() | data preprocessing -> model.fit()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, clear implementation of an LSTM-based sentiment analysis pipeline. It loads data from a public dataset, decodes a review for display, constructs a neural network, and trains it. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No logical errors or security issues are identified. The code's operations are confined to local data processing and model training, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of sentiment analysis with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
