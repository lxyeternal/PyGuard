{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using an LSTM neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the IMDB dataset via tensorflow.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data(), and uses get_word_index() to map indices to words.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs decoded review text via print(), and trains a model with fit() method; no data leaks or external system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded and preprocessed (source), then passed into the model for training (sink). No external or untrusted data is generated or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code segments. The code is straightforward, involving standard ML procedures. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads IMDB dataset, processes text data, maps indices to words, and trains an LSTM model for sentiment classification. It uses standard libraries and methods without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external network activity, system manipulation, or privacy leaks are present. The use of standard datasets and libraries suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of sentiment analysis using TensorFlow/Keras. No malicious or suspicious activity detected; it appears to be a legitimate model training script.",
