{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow for linear regression analysis on housing data, including data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' via pandas.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks occur; no network, file system, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from a CSV, processed, split into training and testing sets, used for model fitting and prediction, then visualized. No flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations beyond standard data analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic execution, hidden code, or obfuscated segments. The code is straightforward and typical for a data analysis task.",
  "analysis": "The script loads housing data, performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations, and applies a linear regression model. It does not contain any code that manipulates system files maliciously, sends data over the network, or accesses sensitive environment variables. It uses standard libraries without malicious modifications or obfuscation. The code is consistent with common data science practices and does not exhibit any signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign machine learning example without malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies, malware, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
