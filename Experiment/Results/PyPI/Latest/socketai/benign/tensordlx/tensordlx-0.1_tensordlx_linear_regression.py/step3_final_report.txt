{
  "purpose": "The code implements a basic linear regression analysis on housing data, including data loading, visualization, and model evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'USA_Housing.csv' from external data source.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; outputs are visualizations and printed metrics.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from CSV (source), processed, and used for model training and evaluation (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; standard data science operations; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data analysis tasks: reading CSV data, visualizing correlations, dropping columns, splitting data, training a linear regression model, and plotting results. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The data source is external but standard in data workflows. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common libraries without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data science script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security concern relates to reading external data, which is typical in such workflows. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
