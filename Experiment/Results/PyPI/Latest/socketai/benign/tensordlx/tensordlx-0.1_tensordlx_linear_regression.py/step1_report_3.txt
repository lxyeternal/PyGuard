{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow for predicting housing prices using linear regression, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv' using pd.read_csv().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that send untrusted data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input from pd.read_csv() flows through data processing, model training, and evaluation functions, but all data handling appears standard and within a trusted environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior are detected. All imported modules are standard data science libraries; no obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a linear regression analysis pipeline. It loads data from a CSV file, performs exploratory data analysis with visualization, drops an address column, splits data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. No external or untrusted data inputs or suspicious operations are evident. All steps are typical for data analysis and machine learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious code or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign machine learning script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified. It is a typical example of data analysis and modeling using publicly available libraries.",
