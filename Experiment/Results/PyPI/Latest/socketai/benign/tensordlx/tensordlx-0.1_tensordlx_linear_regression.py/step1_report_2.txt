  "purpose": "To perform linear regression analysis on the USA Housing dataset, including data visualization, training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads the CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv' via pandas' read_csv method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code outputs plots and printed metrics, which are not security-sensitive.",
  "flows": "Reads data from CSV -> processes data -> splits into training/testing sets -> fits model -> predicts -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries for data analysis and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, splits data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, and visualizes results. No input/output operations involve untrusted data other than a CSV file. The code does not contain any malicious functions, network activity, or suspicious behavior. It utilizes common libraries and functions as expected for data science workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data analysis script for linear regression on a publicly available dataset. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or other security risks.",
