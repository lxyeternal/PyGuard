  "purpose": "The code demonstrates a machine learning workflow for linear regression analysis on housing data, including data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV file 'USA_Housing.csv' via pandas.read_csv()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output, network transmission, or sensitive data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Input from CSV file -> data processing and modeling -> output visualizations and metrics",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard libraries and functions",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, drops specific features, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. It uses common practices and well-known libraries, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The only potential concern might be reading from an external CSV file, but this is standard for data analysis workflows. No data leakage, code injection, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data analysis and machine learning example without malicious intent. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
