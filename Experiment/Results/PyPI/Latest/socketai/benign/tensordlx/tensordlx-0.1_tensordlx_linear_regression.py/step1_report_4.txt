{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates a basic implementation of a linear regression model for housing price prediction using pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'USA_Housing.csv' via pd.read_csv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include print statements for error metrics, and visualizations with plt and sns, which do not involve untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a CSV, processed, and used for training and prediction; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present. Visualizations and calculations are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a dataset, performs exploratory data analysis with plots, drops an address column, splits data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, and evaluates its performance. All operations are typical for a data science pipeline. No code injection, malicious network activity, or privacy violations are evident. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign example of a linear regression model with exploratory analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
