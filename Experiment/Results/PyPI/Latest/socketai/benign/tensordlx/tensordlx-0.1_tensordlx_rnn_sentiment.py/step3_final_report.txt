{
  "purpose": "Display static comments and import statements related to RNN sentiment analysis, serving as documentation or placeholder code.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the static string within the display_code method.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external interactions; no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "None; the code only prints a static string with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method that prints a static string containing comments about an RNN example. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external communications. The import statements are harmless and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is purely informational or documentation in nature, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal comments and static nature suggest a benign purpose, with no security risks or vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a static display of comments and import statements related to RNN sentiment analysis. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and non-executable nature.",
