  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tensordlx' Python package, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package metadata, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leaks or malicious data handling present.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads dependencies and description files, then configures package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out URL line; no hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to define package setup parameters. It specifies package name, version, and dependencies such as numpy, pandas, tensorflow, etc., which are common in ML projects. The README.md is read for long description. There are no external URL references, hardcoded secrets, or code that executes untrusted data. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with typical dependencies. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues are detected.",
