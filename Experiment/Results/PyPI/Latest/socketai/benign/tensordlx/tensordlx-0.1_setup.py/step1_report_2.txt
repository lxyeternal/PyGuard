  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'tensordlx' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements, package discovery via find_packages(), author info, and README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out URL (potential placeholder), standard setup structure, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package info, dependencies, and reads the README file for description. No dynamic code execution, no input from external sources at runtime, and no suspicious behavior detected. The dependencies are standard for a machine learning project. The commented URL suggests a placeholder for a repository but is harmless. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a normal setup configuration for a Python project.",
