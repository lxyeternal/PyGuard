{
  "purpose": "The code imports several example modules related to machine learning models, including linear regression, multiclass classification, and sentiment analysis using LSTM and RNN architectures.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the same package directory (linear_regression, multiclass_classifier, lstm_sentiment, rnn_sentiment).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no external data output, network connections, or data leaks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are referenced but not executed or used in a way that demonstrates data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard import structure for a package's example scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from sibling modules within a package, likely for organizing example scripts. No runtime logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The module references are consistent with typical package structure. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code does not include any dynamic execution, credential handling, or external connections.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module import list for example machine learning models. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be a standard, safe code snippet for organizing module imports in a Python package.",
