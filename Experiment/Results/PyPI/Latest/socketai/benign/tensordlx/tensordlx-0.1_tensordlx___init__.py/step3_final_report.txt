{
  "purpose": "The code imports several classes from sibling modules, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes from sibling modules. There is no execution, data handling, or network activity. The import statements are standard and do not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The risk and malware scores are justified as zero, given the benign nature. The security risk is minimal, but a slight potential (score ~0.1) could be acknowledged if considering the implementation of imported classes, which is outside this snippet. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements with no malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
