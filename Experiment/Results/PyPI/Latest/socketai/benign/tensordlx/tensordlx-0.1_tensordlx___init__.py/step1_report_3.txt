{
  "purpose": "The code imports various machine learning example classes related to regression and sentiment analysis, likely for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package directory for linear_regression, multiclass_classifier, lstm_sentiment, and rnn_sentiment modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only performs static imports of classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules within the same package. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or obfuscated elements. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. It appears to be a standard set of class imports for a machine learning package or examples collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for importing specific example classes related to machine learning models. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
