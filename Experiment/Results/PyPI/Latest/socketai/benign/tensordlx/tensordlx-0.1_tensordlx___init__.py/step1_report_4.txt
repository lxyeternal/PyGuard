{
  "purpose": "This code imports example classes related to machine learning models, such as linear regression and sentiment analysis, from local modules.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local files: .linear_regression, .multiclass_classifier, .lstm_sentiment, .rnn_sentiment",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported classes, but no direct sink for untrusted data or system effects shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported classes could be instantiated and used elsewhere, but no execution or data flow is present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; only import statements are shown",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, indicating modular design for ML examples. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no side-effects or suspicious activities visible. Since no execution or data handling occurs here, this code does not pose any security risks or malware concerns. It appears to be benign, intended for importing ML model classes for later use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of import statements for machine learning example classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security issues evident in this fragment.",
