  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report correctly states that the import statements are standard and do not execute malicious code. The risk depends on the imported classes' implementation, which is outside this fragment.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None identified. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report suggests a low risk, which aligns with the import statements alone.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since no malicious activity is indicated and the import statements are straightforward, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report again confirms that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code only imports modules; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The reasoning aligns with the previous reports.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely import statements with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code only imports modules; no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report confirms the benign nature.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Only import statements, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which is justified since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (benign import statements, no execution or data handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The import statements are standard and do not pose security concerns. The actual security risk depends on the content of the imported classes, but based solely on this fragment, there is no indication of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary. The overall security posture based on this code snippet is very low risk.",
