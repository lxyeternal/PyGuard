{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package, primarily to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data or untrusted input used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' to include in package metadata; no other data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read a local file without any validation or sanitization, but this is standard for setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and configures package metadata. It reads a local README.md file for the long_description, which is common practice. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or external data leaks. No obfuscation, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior detected. The script's purpose appears solely to package the project with a descriptive placeholder note. Overall, the code is standard, legitimate, and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is straightforward, standard, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and reads a local file. No malware or security issues detected.",
