  "purpose": "Define a placeholder Python package setup configuration to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, package discovery via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted data, network, or external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of a placeholder package with generic metadata; no suspicious code or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and configures a package with metadata, including reading a README file for the long description. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The setup is straightforward, serving as a placeholder with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The long_description reading from a file is standard for package setup and does not pose a security risk. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup configuration intended as a placeholder to prevent dependency confusion. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
