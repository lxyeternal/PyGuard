  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules, and reads package metadata (name, version, author, description, etc.). No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flow paths identified; package metadata and entry points are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is suspicious ('hitler@gmail.com'), which could be intended as a humorous placeholder but may raise reputational concerns. The URL 'https://thugging.org' is unusual and potentially suspicious. No obfuscation or hidden code detected; code structure is standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for package configuration. It specifies package details and entry points. The author email and URL are unconventional but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python package with unusual metadata details but no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
