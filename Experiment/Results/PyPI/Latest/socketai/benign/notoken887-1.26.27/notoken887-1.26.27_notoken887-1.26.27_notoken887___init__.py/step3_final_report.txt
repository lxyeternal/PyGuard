  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of a Python package dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file operations, eval/exec execution, data leakage points",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via eval/exec",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation signs, use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, complex or misleading code structures",
  "analysis": "The code is absent in most reports, making analysis straightforward: no code means no risk. When code is present, benign patterns are noted in reports 2 and 4, with scores reflecting low risk. Report 3 indicates obfuscation and eval/exec usage, raising suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Scores are generally consistent with the described code features. Slight adjustments are recommended: lowering securityRisk in report 2 from 0.2 to 0 for a more accurate reflection of benign code, and maintaining or slightly reducing malware score in report 3 from 0.3 to 0.2-0.25 due to lack of concrete malicious evidence. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and the scoring system appropriately reflects suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code, with appropriate zero scores. Report 3's suspicion of obfuscation justifies moderate scores, though no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Minor score adjustments can improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable. The overall security posture appears low risk, with no critical threats identified.",
