  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of code content. It may be intended for data processing, utility functions, or other operations typical of a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code potentially reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files, but no specific source code is provided to identify exact sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but no such sinks are evident from the empty input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow can be identified due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns present because no code is provided to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The analysis cannot be performed as no source code is included. Without code content, it is impossible to identify data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "No code content was provided; therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be assessed. The review yields no findings.",
