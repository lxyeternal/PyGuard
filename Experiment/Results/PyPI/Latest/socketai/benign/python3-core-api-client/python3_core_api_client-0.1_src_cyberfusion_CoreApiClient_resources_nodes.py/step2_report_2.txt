  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a class `Nodes` that wraps API calls to manage nodes.\n- It uses `self.api_connector.send_or_fail()` to send HTTP requests.\n- It constructs request payloads from method parameters and request models.\n- Responses are parsed into models.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard API client.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard API client for node management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score is appropriate given the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar API client for node management.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, standard URL usage.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard request handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** API client for node operations.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, straightforward URL construction.\n- **Analysis:** Routine API interaction, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Client for managing nodes.\n- **Findings:** Uses user-controlled `callback_url`, but only sends it to the API.\n- **Analysis:** The code does not process or execute this URL; it's just transmitted. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to `callback_url` being user-controlled, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** API client for node management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Routine API wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is a standard API client.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to the nature of API wrapper code, which is inherently safe unless misused.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only minor point is the `callback_url` parameter, which is user-controlled. While it could be exploited if the API or server is compromised, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The overall security posture is high; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | **0**             | No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.             |\n| **Obfuscated** | **0**             | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                            |\n| **Risk**       | **0.1 - 0.2**     | Standard API client; minimal security risk, mainly due to user-controlled parameters. |\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse of user-controlled parameters, but not malicious)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
