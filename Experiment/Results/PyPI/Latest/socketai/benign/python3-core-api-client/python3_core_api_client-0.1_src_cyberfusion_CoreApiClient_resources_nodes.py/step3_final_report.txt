  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing nodes via REST endpoints, facilitating create, read, update, delete, list, and upgrade/downgrade operations.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (e.g., request objects, id_, callback_url, product), API responses from self.api_connector.send_or_fail()",
  "sinks": "API request calls (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE), response JSON parsing into models",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request payloads or query parameters; responses flow into model construction",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected; 'callback_url' is user-controlled but only transmitted to API",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with standard HTTP methods, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and no insecure data handling. The 'callback_url' parameter is user-controlled but only sent to the API, which is typical. No signs of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. Response handling is standard, and URL constructions are safe. The consistent scores across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) align with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured API client with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The low risk score is justified. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
