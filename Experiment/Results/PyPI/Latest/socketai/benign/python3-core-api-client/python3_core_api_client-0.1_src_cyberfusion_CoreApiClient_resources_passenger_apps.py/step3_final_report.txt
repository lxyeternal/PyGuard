  "purpose": "API client wrapper for managing passenger applications via REST API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as request objects, URL path parameters (id_), query parameters (skip, limit, filter_, sort), and optional callback_url.",
  "sinks": "API request construction, especially URL paths and request data; response JSON parsing into models.",
  "flows": "Input data → request construction → API call via send_or_fail → JSON response → model construction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; straightforward request-response flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client implementation with methods for creating, listing, reading, updating, deleting, and restarting passenger apps. It uses conventional request patterns, constructs URLs with path parameters, and processes JSON responses into data models. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The data flows are typical for such clients, with no untrusted data reaching dangerous sinks without validation. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores (all zero or very low) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
