  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard API client with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It constructs requests from parameters and processes responses into models. No suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a straightforward API client with no signs of malicious activity. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher but still low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the standard nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical API wrapper with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Zero risk aligns with the straightforward, benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the standard API interactions.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware scores are all zero, reflecting no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The risk scores are low, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- Based on the provided code and reports, **the scores are appropriate and consistent**.\n- I would agree with the current scores, as there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (aligning with the reports)\n\nThis code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured API client with no security concerns.",
