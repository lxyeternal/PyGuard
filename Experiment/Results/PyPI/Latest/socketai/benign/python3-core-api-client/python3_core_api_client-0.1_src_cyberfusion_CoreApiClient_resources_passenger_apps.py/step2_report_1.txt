  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward API client wrapper for managing passenger applications.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.\n- The data flows involve typical request/response handling with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code appears to be a standard API client implementation without vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Issues in reasoning:** No flaws are evident. All reports correctly interpret the code as a typical API wrapper.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Risk Score Analysis:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics. No report assigns a high risk, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, the scores of 0 are justified.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware, focusing instead on the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low, standard API client.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API client for managing passenger applications. It does not exhibit any signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the assessments provided. The code is safe, and the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0 (or very close to it).",
