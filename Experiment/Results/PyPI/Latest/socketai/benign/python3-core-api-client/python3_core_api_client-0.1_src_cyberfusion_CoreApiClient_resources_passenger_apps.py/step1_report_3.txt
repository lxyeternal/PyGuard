{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for managing passenger applications via API calls to a backend service.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., request objects, path parameters, query parameters) and API responses (JSON).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data from API responses is used to construct model objects. User-supplied parameters such as 'id_' and 'callback_url' are used in API request URLs and query parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., request objects, 'id_', 'callback_url') are used to construct API requests; responses (JSON) are parsed and converted into models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious API endpoints or unusual code logic are present. No data leakage or malicious code is evident. The code follows standard API client patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client implementation for managing passenger apps, with methods for create, read, update, delete, list, and restart operations. It uses standard patterns of constructing requests and processing responses. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The parameters are passed and used in API requests securely, with no suspicious handling. The code is well-structured and does not contain any anomalies or obfuscated segments. It appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client for managing passenger applications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and normal, with no malicious payloads or backdoors present.",
