  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios with additional attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or data sinks; code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of @dataclass for exceptions is uncommon but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with two fields: body (str) and status_code (int). The use of @dataclass simplifies their creation. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining structured exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes using dataclasses.",
