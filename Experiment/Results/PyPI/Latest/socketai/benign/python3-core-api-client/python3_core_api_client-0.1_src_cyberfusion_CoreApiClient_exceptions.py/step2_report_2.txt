  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code simply defines two exception classes using @dataclass, with no external input, data flow, or output.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The use of dataclasses for exceptions is unconventional but not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code matches the \"Original Code\" provided.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n- Malware score: 0 is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security risks identified.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, and the code is benign, I agree with the given scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
