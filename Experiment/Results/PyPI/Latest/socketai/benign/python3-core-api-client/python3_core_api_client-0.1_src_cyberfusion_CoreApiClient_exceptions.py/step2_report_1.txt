  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply defines two exception classes using dataclasses, with no dynamic behavior, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - **Conclusion**: The code is benign, and no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that using dataclasses for exceptions is uncommon but not suspicious. This is accurate.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flow, data sinks, or external inputs.\n   - The analysis is consistent and logically sound.\n   - No factual errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - **Conclusion**: The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified given the benign code.\n   - No reason exists to elevate risk scores since no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.\n   - **Conclusion**: Scores are justified; no adjustments necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.\n   - **Conclusion**: Malware scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as straightforward class definitions.\n   - No overinterpretation or unwarranted suspicion is evident.\n   - **Conclusion**: Claims are reasonable and justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency with the Reports**:\n   - The scores align well with the analysis and the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes using dataclasses. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior, data handling, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary**: No changes needed; the current evaluation accurately reflects the security posture of this code snippet.",
