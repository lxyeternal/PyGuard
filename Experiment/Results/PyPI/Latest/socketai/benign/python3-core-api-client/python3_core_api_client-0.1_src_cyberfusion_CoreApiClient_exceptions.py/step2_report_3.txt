  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two exception classes: `CallException` and `AuthenticationException`.\n- Both are decorated with `@dataclass`.\n- Each has two fields: `body` (str) and `status_code` (int).\n- No external input, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with dataclasses.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The code is benign and serves a standard purpose.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- No flaws detected in the reports’ reasoning. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious patterns.\n- The assertion that use of dataclasses for exceptions is uncommon but not suspicious is accurate, but it does not imply any security concern.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThis is consistent with the code and reasoning.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not read or write external data.\n- No data flows involve untrusted sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes using dataclasses, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores or analysis.",
