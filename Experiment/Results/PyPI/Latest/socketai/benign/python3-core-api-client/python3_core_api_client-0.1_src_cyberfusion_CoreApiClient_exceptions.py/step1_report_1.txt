  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for call and authentication errors using dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and dataclass fields",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input to output",
  "anomalies": "Use of dataclasses to define exceptions is uncommon but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code creates two exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with two fields: body (str) and status_code (int). The implementation appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. No external inputs, data handling, or network activity present. The use of dataclasses for exceptions is a stylistic choice but not inherently suspicious. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes using dataclasses. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues identified.",
