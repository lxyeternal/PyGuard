  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling call and authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows between sources and sinks; code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares two dataclass-based exception classes with message and status code attributes. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data handling, no external input/output operations, and no code execution or network interactions. The code appears to be standard, straightforward class definitions with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
