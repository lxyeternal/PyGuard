  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code defines two exception classes, each with two fields: `body` (str) and `status_code` (int), using `@dataclass`.\n- No data input, output, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports uniformly describe the code as standard, benign, and straightforward.\n- They mention that using `@dataclass` for exceptions is uncommon but not suspicious—this is accurate.\n- No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1.0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis, as the code is simple, static, and free of malicious content.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, data flow, or external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or supply chain risks justifies raising the risk score.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly state the code is harmless.\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the reports**\n\n- The scores align well with the analysis provided.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk identified.\n\n**Overall justifications:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static definition of exception classes.\n- No data flow, input/output, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The uniformity and correctness of the reports support these conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with obfuscation also at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- The code poses no supply chain or security concern.",
