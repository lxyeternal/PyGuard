  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling call and authentication errors with additional context.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since there are no inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dataclasses to define exceptions is uncommon but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes using @dataclass for additional attributes. There is no dynamic code execution, no input/output operations, and no external data handling. The classes serve as data containers for error information. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to define custom exception types for error handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
