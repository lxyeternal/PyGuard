{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes using dataclasses for structured error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or data flow; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; class attributes are static and not influenced by external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward dataclass-based exception definitions with no external interactions or malicious patterns. The use of dataclasses for exceptions is unconventional but benign. No data flow or external data handling occurs. The code is static, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The exception classes are simple data containers with no external dependencies or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
