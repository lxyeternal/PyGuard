  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling call and authentication errors with additional attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard use of dataclasses and exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'dataclass' from 'dataclasses' and defines two custom exception classes with additional fields. The classes are straightforward and typical for error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code is minimal and appears to serve a standard purpose in exception management.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exception classes for error handling purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal and benign code snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
