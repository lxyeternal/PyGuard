{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Resource' that initializes with a 'CoreApiConnector' object, likely for interacting with an API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'TYPE_CHECKING' constant from 'typing' and potentially imports 'CoreApiConnector' for type hints only during static type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up a class with a type-checked dependency injection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' for conditional import is standard and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime import of 'CoreApiConnector', using it solely for type hints. It defines a class 'Resource' with an initializer that assigns the connector instance. No input/output handling, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The pattern is common for type hinting without incurring import overhead or dependency issues at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign class setup with conditional type hinting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a minimal, standard pattern for type hints in Python.",
