  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING\n\nif TYPE_CHECKING:  # pragma: no cover\n    from cyberfusion.CoreApiClient.connector import CoreApiConnector\n\nclass Resource:\n    def __init__(self, api_connector: \"CoreApiConnector\") -> None:\n        self.api_connector = api_connector\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Purpose & Sources:**\nAll reports correctly identify that the code defines a `Resource` class with a dependency on `CoreApiConnector`, used for API interactions. The import is within the `TYPE_CHECKING` block, which is standard for type hints to avoid runtime import overhead.\n\n### 2. **Sinks & Flows:**\nNo untrusted data sinks, external input handling, or data flows are present. The code only assigns a passed-in object to an instance variable, with no network activity, data processing, or output.\n\n### 3. **Anomalies & Logic:**\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional import is a common pattern to prevent circular dependencies and reduce runtime overhead.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present.\n- The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a dependency injection pattern.\n\n### 4. **Analysis & Conclusion:**\n- All reports agree that this is benign, standard code for type hinting.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected.\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond class and type annotation setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores Evaluation & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Potential Discrepancies or Recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence scores (1 and 0.9) are justified given the simplicity and standard pattern of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code as a benign, standard pattern for type hinting with no malicious implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign pattern used in Python projects to avoid runtime import issues while providing type hints. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
