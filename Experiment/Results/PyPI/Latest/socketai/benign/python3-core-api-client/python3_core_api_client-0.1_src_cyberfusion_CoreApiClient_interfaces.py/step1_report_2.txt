{
  "purpose": "Defines a Resource class that initializes with a CoreApiConnector instance, intended for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Type hinting import of CoreApiConnector inside a TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class and method definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a class that stores a reference to an API connector for future use. The import occurs only during type checking, avoiding runtime imports, which is a common pattern. No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no suspicious code activities. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for API interaction, with no signs of backdoors, data theft, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing a simple class with type hints. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
