{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Resource class that depends on an external CoreApiConnector, likely for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the api_connector parameter passed to the Resource class during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause harm, such as network connections or file writes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns a parameter to an instance variable.",
  "anomalies": "The import within the TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class definition with a constructor that assigns an external API connector object to an attribute. It uses a type hint for clarity, imported only during static type checking to avoid runtime overhead. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or insecure patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a dependency injection pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class setup for dependency injection, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
