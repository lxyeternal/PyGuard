{
  "purpose": "Defines a Resource class with a dependency on CoreApiConnector, used for API interactions, with conditional import for type hints.",
  "sources": "The import of CoreApiConnector within the TYPE_CHECKING block; the constructor parameter api_connector.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external input handling, or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; the code only assigns the passed-in connector to an instance variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for type hinting and dependency injection; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class setup with conditional import for type hints, avoiding runtime overhead. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for type hinting in Python, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
