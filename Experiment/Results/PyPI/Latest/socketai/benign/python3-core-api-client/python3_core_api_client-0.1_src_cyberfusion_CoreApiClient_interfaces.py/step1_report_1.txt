{
  "purpose": "Defines a Resource class that initializes with a CoreApiConnector object for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the type annotation for 'api_connector' and the conditional import of 'CoreApiConnector' under TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets an instance variable.",
  "anomalies": "The import is conditional on TYPE_CHECKING, which is standard for type hints and does not indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class only for type hints to avoid runtime import overhead. It defines a simple class with an initializer storing a reference. There are no data flows from external inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive operations. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type-hinting pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
