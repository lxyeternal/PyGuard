{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class Resource that holds a reference to a CoreApiConnector, likely for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and the imported module 'CoreApiConnector' during type checking, but does not execute at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only involves static type hints and class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING to import 'CoreApiConnector' only during type checking is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'CoreApiConnector' solely for type annotations within a TYPE_CHECKING block, which is a common pattern to avoid circular imports and reduce runtime overhead. The Resource class simply stores an instance of this connector. No input/output, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign class definition used for type hinting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
