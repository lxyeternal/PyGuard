  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a class `Resource` with an `__init__` method that takes an `api_connector` parameter, annotated as `\"CoreApiConnector\"`.\n- The import of `CoreApiConnector` is wrapped inside a `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block, which is a common pattern to avoid runtime import overhead, only importing for static type checking.\n- The code does not process external data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information.\n- The code appears to be a minimal dependency injection pattern for API interaction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The code matches the original snippet.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a benign pattern used for type hints, with no data flows, no external input processing, and no security risks.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with security risk also at 0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation or confusing constructs. Obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  No security risks are evident; the code is purely structural for type hints. A score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n  The reports assume standard patterns and do not suggest any hidden malicious intent. Given the code's simplicity, these assumptions are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard pattern for type hinting in Python. No security issues, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
