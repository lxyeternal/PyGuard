  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API client for CRUD operations on firewall groups. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score reflects minimal concerns, and malware score is zero, consistent with the report.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client code with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score due to generic API client, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard API wrapper code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 seem fitting.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score is acceptable, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; standard API client code, no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable given the code's nature as an API client.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to the nature of the code being an API client with minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
