{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python API client for Cyberfusion's Core API, managing authentication via username/password or API key, with token refresh, resource access, retries, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user credentials, API responses, and query parameters; accesses resources via properties.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data in network requests, including headers, request data, and query parameters; handles responses from API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Credentials and API key are used to obtain tokens; tokens are stored and refreshed; requests are made with proper headers; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client. It manages credentials securely, refreshes tokens appropriately, retries failed requests, and accesses resources via properties. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution. Network interactions are directed solely at the intended API endpoints with proper verification. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented API client with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk scores are justified, and the reports accurately reflect the code's safety.",
