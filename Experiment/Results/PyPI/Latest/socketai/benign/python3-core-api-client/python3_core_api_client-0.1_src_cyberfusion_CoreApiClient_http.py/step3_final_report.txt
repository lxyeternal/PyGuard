  "purpose": "Modeling an HTTP response with properties to check failure status and parse JSON content.",
  "sources": "The 'body' attribute containing response data.",
  "sinks": "The 'json' property where 'json.loads(self.body)' parses the response body.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'body' flows into 'json.loads' for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard response handling code with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response dataclass with attributes for status code, body, and headers. It includes properties to determine if the response failed and to parse the body as JSON. All imports are standard, and the code is straightforward. Parsing 'body' with 'json.loads' is common in HTTP response handling. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is the parsing of untrusted data, but this is typical in such contexts. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent; the security risk score is 0, with a minor increase to 0.1 in one report due to the inherent risk of parsing untrusted JSON, which is acceptable. Confidence is high (1), given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for handling HTTP responses. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the minimal security concern regarding JSON parsing is accurately reflected in the small risk score. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
