  "purpose": "Define a Response data structure to handle HTTP responses, including status, body, headers, and properties for failure detection and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Code imports (json, dataclasses, http, typing, requests.structures), class attributes, property methods",
  "sinks": "json.loads(self.body) potentially deserializes untrusted data, but this is a standard operation for processing HTTP responses",
  "flows": "Input data (HTTP response body) flows from the self.body attribute into json.loads for parsing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and typical for HTTP response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass Response with fields for status_code, body, and headers. The failed property checks if the status code indicates an error. The json property parses the response body into a Python object. All components are standard for handling HTTP responses. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity are present. Usage of json.loads is typical and does not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling HTTP responses, with no malicious behavior detected. It is safe and intended for typical response processing.",
