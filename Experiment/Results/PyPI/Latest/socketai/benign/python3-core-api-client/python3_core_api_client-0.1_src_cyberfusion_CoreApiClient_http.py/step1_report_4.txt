{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for handling HTTP responses with methods to check failure status and parse JSON content.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'body' attribute of the Response class, expected to be a JSON string.",
  "sinks": "The 'json' property parses 'body' into a Python object; if 'body' contains untrusted data, parsing could potentially lead to issues, but not malicious in itself.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'body' (input) into the 'json' property for parsing; the 'failed' property evaluates 'status_code' for failure condition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. Use of standard library features and requests structures is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response dataclass encapsulating HTTP response details. It includes properties to determine if the response indicates failure ('failed') and to parse the response body as JSON ('json'). The code uses standard libraries (json, dataclasses, http) and types, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, and no malicious code behavior present. It is a straightforward data container for HTTP response data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and safe implementation for handling HTTP responses. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. The implementation appears correct and secure for its intended purpose.",
