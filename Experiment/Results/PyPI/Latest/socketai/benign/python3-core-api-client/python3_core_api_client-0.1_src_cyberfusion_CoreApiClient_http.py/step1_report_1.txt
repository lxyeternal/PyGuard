  "purpose": "Define a data structure for handling HTTP responses, including status, body, headers, and convenience properties.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'body' string and the 'headers' from external HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve parsing 'body' as JSON, which could be malicious if untrusted data is processed maliciously, but in this context, it's standard parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from external HTTP response into the Response object, with 'body' being parsed via json.loads if accessed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears straightforward and standard for HTTP response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response dataclass with status_code, body, and headers. It includes properties to determine if the request failed and to parse the body as JSON. All imports are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. It simply models response data, which is typical in HTTP handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure for managing HTTP responses with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern with no suspicious elements.",
