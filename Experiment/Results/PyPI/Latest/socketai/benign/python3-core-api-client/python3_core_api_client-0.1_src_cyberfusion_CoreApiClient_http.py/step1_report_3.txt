  "purpose": "Define a Response dataclass for handling HTTP responses, including status, body, and headers, with properties to check failure and parse JSON content.",
  "sources": "Imports json, dataclasses, HTTPStatus, and typing; reads data from the 'body' attribute for JSON parsing; reads 'status_code' for failure check.",
  "sinks": "The json property calls json.loads on body, which could potentially be exploited if body contains malicious content, but in this context, it is a standard JSON parse operation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'body' attribute to the 'json' property via json.loads, and status_code influences the 'failed' property.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and there are no hidden or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple dataclass 'Response' with attributes for HTTP response components. The 'failed' property checks if the status code indicates failure. The 'json' property parses the response body as JSON. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Usage of json.loads on response body is standard, and no external input is directly handled outside typical HTTP response parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling HTTP responses in Python. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no anomalies indicating security risks or malware. It is safe and typical for such a use case.",
