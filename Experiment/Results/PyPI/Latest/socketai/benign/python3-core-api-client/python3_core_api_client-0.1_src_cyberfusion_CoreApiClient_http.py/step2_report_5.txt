  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code provided.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's scores seem appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks identified. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found; reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  - The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but since parsing untrusted JSON can, in theory, be risky if the data is malicious, assigning a small risk score (0.1) is reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just standard JSON parsing. The risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is identical to the original.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n  - The securityRisk is zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the original code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is the same as the original.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware=0.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign obfuscated=0.  \n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the potential (though minimal) risk of parsing untrusted JSON data.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is a straightforward data structure for handling HTTP responses.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) is justified due to the potential dangers of parsing untrusted JSON, but in practice, this is a common and accepted pattern.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slight inherent risk in JSON parsing, but standard practice)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable, and the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
