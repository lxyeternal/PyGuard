  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code does not read data dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink exists in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for custom JSON encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder to serialize datetime objects into a specific string format. It does not contain input handling, external data access, or any dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a utility class for formatting datetime objects during JSON serialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for datetime serialization with no malicious intent or security risks.",
