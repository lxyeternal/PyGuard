  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects in ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely datetime objects passed to the encoder for JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs serialized datetime strings; no direct sink for untrusted data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Datetime objects are passed to the encoder, which converts them to formatted strings for output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs a straightforward custom serialization without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder with a default method that formats datetime objects into ISO 8601 string representations. It imports standard modules and contains no external or potentially malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious logic is present. The implementation is simple and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign custom serializer for datetime objects, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
