  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code defines a class for encoding datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class for formatting datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder that overrides the default method to serialize datetime objects into a specific ISO 8601 string format. It does not include any input handling, external data fetching, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The implementation is standard and aligns with common practices for custom JSON serialization of datetime objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for serializing datetime objects and does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It lacks any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
