  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "The code reads the datetime object 'o' in the 'default' method.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'o.strftime' is returned as a string; no sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "The 'default' method takes a datetime object and returns a formatted string; no external data flow or user input is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs a standard override for JSON serialization of datetime objects without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder with an overridden 'default' method that formats datetime objects into a specific string format. There are no inputs from external sources or outputs that could be exploited. The implementation is straightforward and typical for customizing JSON serialization of datetime objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom JSON encoder for datetime objects with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any malicious actions, leak data, or contain obfuscation.",
