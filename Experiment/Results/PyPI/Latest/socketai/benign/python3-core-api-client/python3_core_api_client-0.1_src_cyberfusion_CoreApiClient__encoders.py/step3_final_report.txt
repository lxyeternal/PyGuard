  "purpose": "Serialize datetime objects into ISO 8601 string format within JSON encoding.",
  "sources": "The default() method called when serializing datetime.datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network, or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects → default() method → formatted string output",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no unusual code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder with an overridden default() method that formats datetime objects into a specific ISO 8601 string. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The implementation is standard and benign. All reviews correctly identify the benign nature, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score is minimal (around 0 or 0.1). Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, the most accurate assessment is that the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score should be 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
