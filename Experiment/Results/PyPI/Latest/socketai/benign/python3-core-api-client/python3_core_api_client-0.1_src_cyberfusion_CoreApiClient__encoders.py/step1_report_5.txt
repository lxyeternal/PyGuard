  "purpose": "Custom JSON encoder for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format",
  "sources": "Input data involves datetime objects passed to the encoder",
  "sinks": "Data serialized by the encoder, likely to be outputted or stored",
  "flows": "Datetime objects (sources) are passed to the encoder, which outputs formatted strings (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder that serializes datetime objects into a specific ISO 8601 format with milliseconds and a 'Z' suffix. There are no input reading or data exfiltration mechanisms, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious code segments. The code strictly focuses on data formatting for datetime serialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign task of formatting datetime objects for JSON serialization. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
