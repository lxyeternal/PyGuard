  "sinks": "Parsing JSON into models, returning list of models",
  "flows": "API request -> JSON response -> model construction",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward API interaction with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests to retrieve logs, with parameters passed as query parameters. Responses are parsed into models without any obfuscation or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The external API connector's trustworthiness is assumed but not verified; however, no signs of malicious activity are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward API client for log retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the external API call context. No modifications to the scores or assessment are necessary.",
