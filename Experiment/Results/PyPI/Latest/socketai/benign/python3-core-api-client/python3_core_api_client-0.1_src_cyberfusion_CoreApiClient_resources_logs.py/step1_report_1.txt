{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods to retrieve access and error logs for a virtual host via API calls, primarily for monitoring or auditing purposes.",
  "sources": "API calls to endpoints /api/v1/logs/access/{virtual_host_id} and /api/v1/logs/error/{virtual_host_id} with parameters that include timestamp, sort, and limit.",
  "sinks": "The code processes JSON responses from the API and constructs model instances. No direct sinks of untrusted data into sensitive operations or system resources are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (virtual_host_id, timestamp, sort, limit) are used in API requests. The responses are JSON objects parsed into models. No untrusted data is executed or leaked.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior. The code primarily performs API requests and data modeling. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines methods to fetch logs from specific API endpoints, passing parameters securely via query parameters. It uses standard practices for REST API calls, data parsing, and object construction. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical API client module designed for log retrieval without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for log retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard API interaction patterns and does not contain any anomalies or obfuscated logic.",
