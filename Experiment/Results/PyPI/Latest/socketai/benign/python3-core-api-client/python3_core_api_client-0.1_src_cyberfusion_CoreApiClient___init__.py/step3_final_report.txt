  "purpose": "Assessment of open source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment) to sinks (network, files, system).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code or absence of code, with scores reflecting minimal risk. High confidence in benign assessments aligns with the lack of suspicious signals. Scores are consistent with the content provided; minor conservatism in risk scores is acceptable. No anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and poses minimal security risk. All reports are consistent and justified. No adjustments necessary.",
