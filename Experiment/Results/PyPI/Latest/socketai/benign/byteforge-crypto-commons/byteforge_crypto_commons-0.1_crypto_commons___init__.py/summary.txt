  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in some cases, warranting cautious scores. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but the potential for malicious activity justifies moderate malware and risk scores, especially in reports highlighting eval() and network calls. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and consistent with the features described."
