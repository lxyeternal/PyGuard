  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external modules, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs may reach sinks like network or system calls via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (high in some reports), dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network activity, complex control flow, inconsistent variable naming, hidden modules.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify suspicious features like obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores for obfuscation (0.7 in report 1, 0.3 in report 5) align with descriptions. Malware suspicion (0.4 in reports 1 and 4) is justified but could be slightly increased for report 4 due to eval() and network calls. Benign reports (2, 3, 5) are appropriately scored with low malware and risk. The overall reasoning is consistent, with minor adjustments recommended for report 4's malware score to better reflect the potential threat posed by eval() and network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in some cases, warranting cautious scores. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but the potential for malicious activity justifies moderate malware and risk scores, especially in reports highlighting eval() and network calls. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and consistent with the features described.",
