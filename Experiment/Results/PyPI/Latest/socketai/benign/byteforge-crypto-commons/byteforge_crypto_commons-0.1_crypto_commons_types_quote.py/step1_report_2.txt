  "sources": "No external input sources; data is stored via class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data outputs or external interactions in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing; purely a data class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a @dataclass 'Quote' with various attributes representing cryptocurrency market data, including optional fields with default values. The use of 'datetime' and 'typing' modules is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, data injections, or external calls. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The structure appears straightforward and focused solely on data storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python data class used for modeling cryptocurrency quote data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, well-structured data container.",
