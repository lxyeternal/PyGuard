  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing cryptocurrency market data and statistics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external sources when instances of Quote are created with specific attribute values, particularly last_updated (datetime) and optional financial metrics.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in the code; data is stored in a class without external data transmission or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (instantiation parameters) into the class attributes, with no processing or untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward data class definition; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python dataclass for representing market data with descriptive docstrings. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. All attributes are typical for financial data representation. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The optional attributes default to safe values and do not pose risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured data container with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines a data model for cryptocurrency quotes, with no external data manipulation, insecure operations, or malicious intent.",
