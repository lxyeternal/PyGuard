{
  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for cryptocurrency market data, encapsulating core metrics and optional extended data for use in applications handling crypto quotes.",
  "sources": "Data is provided via class instantiation; no external input or data reading occurs within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond storing it in class attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation parameters into class attributes; no dynamic or external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a straightforward data class with comprehensive documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured Python dataclass modeling cryptocurrency quote data. It uses standard libraries and contains no dynamic code, external calls, or data processing. All attributes are for data storage, with optional fields having default values. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data container for cryptocurrency market data with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
