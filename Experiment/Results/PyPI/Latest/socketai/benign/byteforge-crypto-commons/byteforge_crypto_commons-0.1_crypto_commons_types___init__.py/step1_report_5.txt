  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or is empty.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input from external sources, files, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable; the code appears static or incomplete.",
  "anomalies": "The code is either missing or contains no discernible functionality; there are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is empty or not present; no logic, data processing, or external interactions are detectable. Without code content, it is impossible to identify source, sink, or flow. This absence suggests no malicious behavior or security issues within the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears empty or missing, leading to a very low malware and security risk score.",
