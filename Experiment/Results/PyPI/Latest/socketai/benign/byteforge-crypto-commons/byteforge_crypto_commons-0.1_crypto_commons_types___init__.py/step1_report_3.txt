{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function arguments, local variables, or imported modules. No external input sources such as network or files are clearly evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print(), logging, or data returned from functions. No signs of data exfiltration, system modification, or network connections are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input points (function parameters or imported modules) through processing logic to output or return statements. No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks such as system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The code structure appears conventional without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with typical import statements, function definitions, and procedural logic. No use of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution methods is detected. There are no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network or system calls. The code does not process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to injection or data leaks. Overall, the structure and content seem benign and consistent with legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal utility or data processing script with no immediate threats or vulnerabilities identified.",
