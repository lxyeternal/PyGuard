  "purpose": "Definition of a data structure to represent the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific timestamp, including metadata and market data.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code defines a class structure only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class serves as a data container without methods or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward data class definition with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and a local Quote class, then defines a dataclass 'TokenState' with multiple fields, including both required and optional attributes for token metadata and market info. The comments clarify the purpose of each field. No dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators are evident. Usage of type annotations and optional fields is standard for data models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data structure definition intended for representing token states in a crypto application. It contains no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
