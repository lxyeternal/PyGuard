  "purpose": "Definition of a data class representing the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific point in time.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the class contains only data fields with no data input or retrieval mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only defines a data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this is purely a data class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is standard Python data class syntax with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class 'TokenState' with numerous fields to capture detailed information about a cryptocurrency token. The class includes optional and required fields, with appropriate type annotations. There are no external data reads, no network operations, no eval or exec calls, and no code that manipulates or processes data dynamically. The import statements are standard, and the class serves purely as a data container. The structure is clear and typical for modeling token states, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class definition used to model token state information. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, no external data handling, and no security risks are evident. It appears safe and benign.",
