{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'TokenState' representing the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific timestamp, including metadata, market data, supply info, and status indicators.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (dataclasses, typing, datetime) and a local Quote class; no external data input or reading functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication, file I/O, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "The class serves as a static data container; no data flow or processing logic exists within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-annotated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured data class modeling token attributes with no dynamic behavior or external interactions. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import of a local Quote class suggests integration into a larger system, but on its own, it is benign. The uniform scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data container for token information with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
