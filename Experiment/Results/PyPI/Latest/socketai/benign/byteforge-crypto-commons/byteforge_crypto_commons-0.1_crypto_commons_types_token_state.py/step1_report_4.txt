{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific point in time, including market data and metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines a class structure and imports standard modules and a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical sinks; the code only defines a data class with no processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules, defines a dataclass with numerous fields representing token state. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external interactions. All fields are type-annotated with optional defaults, and no functions or executable logic are present that could be malicious. The class solely serves as a data container. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data model definition intended for representing token state information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code snippet.",
