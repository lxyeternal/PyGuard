{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure to represent the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific point in time.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (dataclasses, typing, datetime, and a local Quote class); class attributes for TokenState",
  "sinks": "None; this code only defines a data class with no data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data processing or flow logic present",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; all code appears to be standard class and data structure definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, including a local Quote class, and defines a data class TokenState with numerous fields representing token data. No functions, data processing, or external data handling is present. The structure and annotations are consistent with typical Python data modeling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are observed. The class purely models data attributes for tokens without any active behavior or side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class for representing token states with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system for handling cryptocurrency data. Overall, it is benign and standard in structure.",
