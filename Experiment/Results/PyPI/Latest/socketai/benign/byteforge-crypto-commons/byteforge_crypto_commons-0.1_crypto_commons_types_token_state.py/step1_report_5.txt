  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing the state of a cryptocurrency token at a specific point in time, including various metadata and market data.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines a data class without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "None; as no data processing or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data class definition with standard annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a dataclass 'TokenState' with multiple fields, mostly optional, to represent token-related data. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The class is solely used for data storage, with no indications of malicious logic or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be part of a larger application for handling cryptocurrency data, but on its own, it presents no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It contains no suspicious code or behavior and is safe for use.",
