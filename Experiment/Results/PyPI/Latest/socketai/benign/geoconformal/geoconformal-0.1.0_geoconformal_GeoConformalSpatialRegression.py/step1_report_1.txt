{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be performing geospatial conformal spatial regression, likely for spatial data analysis or modeling.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from external sources such as files or databases, importing modules and libraries, receiving parameters or user inputs for the regression process.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output data to files, displays results, or sends data over network if such operations are included within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input data) through processing functions, models, or algorithms, to sinks (outputs, storage, or network transmission).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected. The code structure appears standard for a spatial regression task.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for spatial regression, processes geospatial data, and performs statistical modeling. No signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are present. The code structure and content suggest typical data analysis workflow. Without actual code details, no malicious patterns are evident. It is a straightforward implementation of geospatial regression, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a geospatial conformal spatial regression process, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content. It is considered low risk.",
