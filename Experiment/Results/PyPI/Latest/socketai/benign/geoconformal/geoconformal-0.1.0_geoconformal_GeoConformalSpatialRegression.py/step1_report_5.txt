{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a geospatial conformal spatial regression analysis, likely for spatial data modeling or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include external files, data variables, or data streams for spatial coordinates and related features.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output files, network transmissions (if any), or sensitive variable exposures such as API keys or credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data loading sources through processing functions and possibly to output or visualization steps, depending on the code structure.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions detected. The code structure appears standard for scientific computation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python implementation of a spatial regression model using well-known libraries. It includes data ingestion, model fitting, and possibly visualization or output steps. No suspicious or malicious operations, such as network calls, system modifications, or hidden behaviors, are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is appropriate and consistent with standard scientific workflows. The code does not contain any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual variable naming indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk. The code performs standard spatial regression analysis without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
