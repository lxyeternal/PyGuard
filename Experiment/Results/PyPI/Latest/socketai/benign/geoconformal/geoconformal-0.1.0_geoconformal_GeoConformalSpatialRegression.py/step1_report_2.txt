{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform geospatial statistical regression analysis, likely for spatial data modeling or prediction.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for regression, such as geospatial coordinates, dependent variables, or feature variables read from files or data structures.",
  "sinks": "Model training outputs, such as saved models, prediction results, or data exports, possibly written to files or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from sources, processed through regression algorithms, and results are saved or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Check for any dynamic code execution or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions to perform spatial regression using standard libraries. It reads data, processes it with spatial weights, and outputs regression results. No suspicious imports, network activity, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code structure follows typical data science workflows, and no anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geospatial regression analysis implementation with no malicious behavior. It does not exhibit malware traits or security risks based on the provided content. The overall security risk is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
