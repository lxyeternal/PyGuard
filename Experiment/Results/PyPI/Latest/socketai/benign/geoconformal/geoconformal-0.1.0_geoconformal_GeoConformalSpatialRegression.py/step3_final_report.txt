  "purpose": "Perform geospatial conformal spatial regression analysis, processing spatial data to generate models or outputs related to geospatial phenomena.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as spatial datasets, user inputs, or files; possibly environment variables if used for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Outputs such as regression results, visualizations, or data exports; potential network transmissions if data is uploaded or results sent externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (datasets, inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, files, network). No suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or unusual behaviors detected or implied.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as performing standard geospatial regression tasks, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The reports consistently assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk scores (0.1 to 0.2). Confidence levels are high, reflecting the lack of suspicious signals. Given the absence of code snippets or suspicious patterns, the assessments are justified. The low risk scores are appropriate for typical scientific analysis code, and no anomalies are present. The evaluations are consistent across reports, and the scores align with the described functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk scores reflect the low threat profile. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe based on the provided descriptions.",
