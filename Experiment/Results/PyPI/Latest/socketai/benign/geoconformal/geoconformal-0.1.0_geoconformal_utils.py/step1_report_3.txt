  "purpose": "The purpose of this utils.py file is not explicitly stated; it appears to contain utility functions or helper code, but the actual content is not provided.",
  "sources": "Since the code content is not included, it's unclear where data input or external sources are read from.",
  "sinks": "Without specific code, no obvious sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or environment variable access can be identified.",
  "flows": "No code provided; thus, no source-to-sink data flows can be analyzed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to lack of code content; the placeholder comment suggests no actual implementation is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a comment placeholder without any actual code, functions, or logic. Without concrete implementation, no security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code can be evaluated. The absence of code prevents identifying sources, sinks, or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is incomplete, and no suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from a comment placeholder. Further review requires actual code content.",
