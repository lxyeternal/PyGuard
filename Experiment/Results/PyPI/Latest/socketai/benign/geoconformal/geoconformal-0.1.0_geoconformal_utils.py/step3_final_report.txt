  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets or comments provided, primarily placeholders or utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code is absent or minimal.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only placeholder comments or benign utility functions; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of executable code, with appropriate low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence levels are consistent with the content, being lower when only placeholders are present. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation are observed. Minor adjustments could be made to risk scores in some reports to reflect the lack of actual code, but overall, the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippets, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the code appears benign or incomplete. The overall assessment confirms the benign nature of the dependency snippets.",
