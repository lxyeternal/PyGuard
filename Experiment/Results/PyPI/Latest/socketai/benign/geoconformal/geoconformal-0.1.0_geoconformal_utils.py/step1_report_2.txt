  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be providing utility functions or helpers for a larger Python project, as suggested by the filename 'utils.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from import statements, environment variables, or function parameters. It may also read files or network data if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network transmissions, file writes, or system calls, if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables, parameters) to sinks (outputs, network, files), possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code contains standard utility functions; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical utility module with helper functions, without any signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or system modifications are evident. The code does not manipulate untrusted input in insecure ways nor contains malicious payloads. Based on the provided content, the code appears benign.",
