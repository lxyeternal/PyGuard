  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or external sources through functions to outputs or side effects, if any.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to consist of typical utility functions with no suspicious or malicious logic. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or secret handling. Since only a placeholder comment is provided, there are no detectable malicious behaviors. The code is standard and safe based on the given snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The utils.py file contains standard utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and unremarkable.",
