  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'geoconformal' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, dependency list, and configuration parameters for setuptools setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects; setup() primarily configures package installation.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from source to sink; data used for package configuration remains local and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The script is a standard setup.py configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package details, dependencies, and classifiers. All variables are static strings or lists, with no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or malicious logic present. The code adheres to typical packaging conventions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
