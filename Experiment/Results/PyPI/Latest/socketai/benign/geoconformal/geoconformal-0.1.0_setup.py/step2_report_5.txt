  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data handling is present.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is a typical package setup script.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1.0 (or 1)\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or external inputs, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the code is straightforward.\n- No suspicious behaviors or external dependencies that could introduce risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
