  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools` to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- All data is hardcoded; no dynamic inputs, external data, or untrusted code execution.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The dependencies are common scientific packages (`numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`).\n- The script performs no network activity, data processing, or code execution beyond package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Are there any?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. No vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified, given the code's simplicity and standard nature.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly assume no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n- **Supply chain risk:**  \n  Since the setup script only defines static metadata and dependencies, supply chain risks are minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a typical, benign package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. No adjustments needed.",
