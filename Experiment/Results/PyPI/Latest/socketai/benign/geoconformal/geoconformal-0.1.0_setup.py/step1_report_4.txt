{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'geoconformal' Python library, specifying metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author info, URL, license, dependencies, and classifiers; these are hardcoded strings and lists.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted or external input data are present. The code does not process user input or network data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks exists. The script solely defines static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for a Python package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package installation, with no dynamic or malicious code. It specifies dependencies, package info, and classifiers in a typical manner. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious anomalies detected. It is a standard package setup file.",
