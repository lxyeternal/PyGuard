{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'geoconformal' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the package metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, author_email, url, license, packages, install_requires, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leaks could occur, as the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues, as the script solely contains static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present. The code is standard for a setup.py file.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions and calls setup() with static arguments describing the package. All fields are standard and do not include any dynamic or external inputs. No code execution, data handling, or network communication occurs. The code is typical for package setup and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for project distribution.",
