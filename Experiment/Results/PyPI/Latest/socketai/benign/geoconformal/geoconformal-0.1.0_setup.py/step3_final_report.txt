  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'geoconformal' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers; no dynamic input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools to specify package details, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, no secrets, and no obfuscated constructs. All signals indicate benign, static configuration intended for package distribution. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence that it is safe. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
