{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package named 'geoconformal' for distribution via package managers such as PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, description, author info, URL, license, dependencies, classifiers, Python version requirements).",
  "sinks": "None identified. The setup script does not perform data output, network communication, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script is a standard setup configuration with no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard 'setuptools' functions for package setup. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with typical package configuration parameters. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. All code appears standard and intended solely for package distribution setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal configuration file for package distribution.",
