  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a comment indicating the package name 'geoconformal' with no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "No sources; only a comment line present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; absence of code prevents any source-to-sink analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only a comment with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is solely a comment indicating the package name. There are no functions, data processing, or executable code. As a result, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of code means no potential for malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero. Confidence is high due to the minimal and clear nature of the snippet, and the lack of code eliminates any suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a comment with no executable content, posing no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are justified and consistent with the evidence. No further analysis is necessary unless actual implementation code is provided.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
