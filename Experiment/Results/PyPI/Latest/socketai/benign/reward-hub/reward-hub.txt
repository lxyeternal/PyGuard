The primary concern is the handling of sensitive data via kwargs, which is common practice but should be managed securely outside this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The static code is legitimate and does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of 'trust_remote_code=True', which poses a significant supply chain risk by enabling remote code execution during model loading. The assigned scores appropriately reflect this risk, with low malware likelihood but high security concern due to the potential for malicious remote code execution."
