  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code performs input validation, class selection, and instantiation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and secure. The low risk score aligns with the findings.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar validation and class instantiation. The only concern is passing sensitive info via **kwargs, which could include API keys. No malicious behavior observed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid points; the code itself isn't malicious, but handling of kwargs warrants cautious deployment. The risk score is appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—validation, class selection, instantiation. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is a typical loader with no malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar validation and class instantiation. Potential concern about kwargs containing sensitive data, but no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid points; the code is benign, with the caveat about handling sensitive info.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same validation pattern, no malicious code or obfuscation. The only potential concern is that reward model classes might execute code internally when instantiated, but this is outside the scope of this loader code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The loader itself is safe; any malicious activity would depend on the imported classes, not this code.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and I concur. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or other malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the handling of **kwargs** which may include sensitive data like API keys. The code validates inputs but does not sanitize or restrict **kwargs**. Given that, a risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting low but non-negligible risk if used improperly.  \n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a simple, well-structured loader with proper validation.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.  \n- The only potential concern relates to the passing of sensitive data via **kwargs**, which is a common pattern but warrants cautious handling outside this code.  \n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports and justified by the handling of sensitive parameters)  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is secure, with minimal inherent risk. The main precaution is to ensure sensitive data passed via **kwargs** is managed securely outside this loader. No changes to the reported scores are necessary.",
