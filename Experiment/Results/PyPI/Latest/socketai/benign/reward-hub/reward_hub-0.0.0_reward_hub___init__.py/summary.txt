  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-validated loader for reward models with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The primary concern is the handling of sensitive data via kwargs, which is common practice but should be managed securely outside this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."
