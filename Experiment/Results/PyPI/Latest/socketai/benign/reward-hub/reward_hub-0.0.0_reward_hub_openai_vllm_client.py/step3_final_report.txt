  "purpose": "Client interface for local language model inference, handling batching, retries, and response validation.",
  "sources": "Prompt strings from input parameters; network requests to localhost endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Responses from local server; no untrusted data flow outside controlled request-response cycle.",
  "flows": "Prompt data is sent via HTTP POST to localhost; responses are processed and validated for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard error handling and retries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward client for a local inference server, with standard concurrency, batching, and retry mechanisms. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external network activity are present. The use of localhost communication and absence of secrets or obfuscation indicate a benign purpose. Assertions and error handling are typical for robustness. The retry logic and request batching are implemented securely, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured client for local language model inference, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the analysis.",
