  "purpose": "Define supported backend models for reward processing in a reward hub system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from reward_hub modules; the SUPPORTED_BACKENDS dictionary defining model mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only imports modules and defines a static dictionary.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no dynamic or user input flows present. The dictionary is a static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from reward_hub modules, indicating dependencies on external reward models. It then defines a static dictionary mapping model identifiers to lists of class references. There are no user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as configuration or setup for a larger system. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup for supported models, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
