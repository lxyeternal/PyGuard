  "purpose": "Define a mapping of backend identifiers to corresponding reward model classes for a reward system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for reward model classes; assignment of a dictionary with backend keys and model class lists.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data output or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Importing classes, then assigning them in a dictionary. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific model classes and creates a dictionary associating string keys with lists of these classes. There are no dynamic imports, no use of eval/exec, and no network operations or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The structure appears straightforward and typical for configuration or registry purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration mapping for reward models, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
