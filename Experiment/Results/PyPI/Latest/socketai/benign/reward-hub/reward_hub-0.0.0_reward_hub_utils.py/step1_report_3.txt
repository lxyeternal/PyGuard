  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of supported backend models for reward processing in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for specific classes from reward_hub modules, and the definition of the SUPPORTED_BACKENDS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code merely imports and defines a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from modules within the 'reward_hub' package, then creates a dictionary mapping model identifiers to lists of class references. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's structure suggests configuration or initialization for a larger application, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of supported models, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It functions as configuration code for model support mapping.",
