  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward configuration, involving import statements and static dictionary definitions.\n- No dynamic code execution, no user input, no network operations, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code's purpose appears to be mapping backend identifiers to reward model classes, likely for use elsewhere in a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code matches the description in each report: static imports and dictionary assignments.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting high certainty about the benign assessment.\n- The reasoning is sound across all reports.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only point where the reports hint at potential risk is in report 5, where they mention that the dictionary could be used later with untrusted data. However, the code snippet itself does not do this; it's just a configuration setup.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** All reports' scores are reasonable given the code.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Should stay at 0, given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** Should stay at 1, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, static configuration with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
