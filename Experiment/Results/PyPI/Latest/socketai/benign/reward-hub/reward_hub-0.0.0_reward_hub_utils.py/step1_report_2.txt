{
  "purpose": "Define a mapping of backend identifiers to associated reward model classes for different reward system implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing reward model classes; assignment of a dictionary mapping backend names to model classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed; the code sets up constants and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to the dictionary assignment, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a static dictionary assignment mapping backend names to model classes. There are no user inputs, network operations, or execution of dynamic code. The classes imported appear to be part of a reward system framework, likely related to machine learning models, with no indication of malicious behavior. The structure and syntax are straightforward and typical for configuration or setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration snippet establishing mappings for reward models with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard for such purposes.",
