  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping model identifiers to associated reward model classes for different backends.",
  "sources": "Import statements for reward model classes; assignment to the SUPPORTED_BACKENDS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of the SUPPORTED_BACKENDS dictionary in subsequent code (not shown), where untrusted data could influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Import reward models -> populate SUPPORTED_BACKENDS -> later usage of this dictionary in application logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. No code execution or external calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from modules related to reward models and constructs a dictionary mapping string keys to class lists. This setup appears to be a straightforward configuration for selecting reward models based on model identifiers. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or external data handling. The code is simple, clear, and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for managing reward model backends. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
