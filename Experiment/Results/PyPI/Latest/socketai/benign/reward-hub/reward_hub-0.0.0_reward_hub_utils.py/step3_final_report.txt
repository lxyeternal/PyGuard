  "purpose": "Mapping backend identifiers to corresponding reward model classes for use in a reward system.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and the SUPPORTED_BACKENDS dictionary defining backend-to-model class mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "The dictionary maps backend strings to class references; no data flow from untrusted sources occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward configuration with static imports and dictionary definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static import statements and a dictionary mapping backend identifiers to class objects. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network operations, or obfuscation. The code serves as configuration, likely for selecting models in a larger system. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
