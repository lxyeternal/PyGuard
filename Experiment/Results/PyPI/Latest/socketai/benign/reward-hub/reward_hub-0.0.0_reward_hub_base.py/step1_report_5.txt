  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for reward models used in AI evaluation, including scoring mechanisms and model loading methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines class structures and methods without executing any data flow or input handling; no source-to-sink data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard class and enum definitions with no suspicious or unusual code segments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The only assertion enforces logical constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and abstract classes for reward models, including enumerations and methods for scoring responses and loading models. It includes type hints and docstrings explaining expected behaviors. No dynamic execution, code injection, or suspicious data handling is present. The assertion in PRMResult enforces correct usage, but does not pose security issues. Overall, the code is a typical framework with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious framework for reward modeling in AI systems. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. It serves as an interface and data structure definition, with no active data processing that could be exploited.",
