{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and utility classes for reward models used in processing and scoring responses, including enumeration and handling of scoring aggregation methods.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources directly; it primarily defines classes and methods for internal processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not establish any data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; it is solely class and method definitions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with standard enum usage, class constructors, and abstract method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for reward models with abstract methods, enum handling, and simple data processing in the PRMResult class. There are no runtime input/output operations, network activities, or data handling that could be exploited maliciously. The code appears to be part of a larger framework and does not perform any risky operations on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a set of class definitions for reward modeling with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
