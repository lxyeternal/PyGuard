  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines abstract classes, enums, and data structures for reward models.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or file I/O are present.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for extension and implementation elsewhere.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, code injection, or backdoors, are evident.\n- The PRMResult class performs score aggregation with input validation, but nothing suspicious in its logic.\n- The assertions and type handling are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are detected in the code snippets provided.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (score 0).\n- **Security risk:** No security risks are identified; all reports assign 0.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable. They correctly identify that the code is a benign framework with no malicious intent.\n- The aggregation method handling in PRMResult is logical, with input validation to prevent misuse.\n- The abstract classes define interfaces, not implementations, so there's no risk of malicious behavior from this code alone.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely structural and does not execute any external commands, process data, or contain hidden behaviors, the risk score should remain very low.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated code remains at 0.\n- Security risk remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The code is a standard, well-structured framework for reward models with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's characteristics.",
