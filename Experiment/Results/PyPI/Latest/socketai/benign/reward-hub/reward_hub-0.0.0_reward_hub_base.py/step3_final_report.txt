{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and utility structures for reward models in AI/ML systems, facilitating scoring and aggregation of responses.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, class attributes, method parameters, type annotations, and internal logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data reads, network calls, or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class methods, with internal calculations and assertions, without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; straightforward use of assertions and type handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign framework comprising enums, data classes, and abstract interfaces for reward models. It performs score aggregation with input validation, uses standard Python features, and contains no external dependencies or malicious constructs. The assertions and type handling are standard and do not introduce security risks. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, intended for extension and integration, with no external or runtime security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured framework for reward modeling with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
