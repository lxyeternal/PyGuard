{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and data structures for reward models used in evaluating responses or processes, including result aggregation methods.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines classes and methods without reading external data or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions; no network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal computations and object attribute assignments; no external data flows or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward class and method definitions with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations, data classes, and abstract base classes for reward models. It includes handling for different aggregation methods with input validation. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is present. The logic appears to be for standard application use, with appropriate use of assertions and type annotations. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of abstract classes and data structures for reward models, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign framework component for AI evaluation systems.",
