  "purpose": "Define abstract classes and data structures for reward models, including scoring methods and aggregation logic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class constructors and methods accept input parameters for scoring and model loading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The code mainly defines classes and methods with standard implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums, data classes, and abstract base classes for reward modeling. The PRMResult class computes aggregate scores based on provided inputs, with logical handling of string and enum aggregation methods. The abstract classes specify interfaces for scoring and loading models but do not include implementation details. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or suspicious logic present. The code appears to be part of a larger framework for reward modeling without embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, structured for reward model abstraction and data handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It functions as a framework interface without active external data operations or security concerns.",
