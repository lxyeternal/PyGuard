{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract base classes and utility classes for reward models used in AI/ML systems, including scoring mechanisms and model loading strategies.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read beyond function parameters; the code mainly processes data passed to its methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present in this code; it is solely defining classes and methods for internal use.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code structures data for internal processing only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are observed; the code is standard class and method definitions for AI reward models.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes abstract classes for different reward models, including outcome, process, and auto reward models. It uses standard Python features such as Enums, abstract base classes, and type annotations. The PRMResult class calculates aggregate scores from input scores with handling for different aggregation methods, including string and enum inputs. There is no indication of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or external data handling. All operations are confined to in-memory computations and class definitions, which are typical in model interface code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and benign implementation of abstract classes and utility structures for reward models in AI systems. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, and it does not include any code that could be used for malicious purposes or supply chain attacks.",
