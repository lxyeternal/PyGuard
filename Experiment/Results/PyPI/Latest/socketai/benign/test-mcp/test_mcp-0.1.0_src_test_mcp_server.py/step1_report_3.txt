{
  "purpose": "The code defines and runs a tool named 'hello_world' using the 'FastMCP' framework, likely for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'FastMCP' from 'mcp.server.fastmcp' and initializes an instance with a string argument. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing a library, creating an object, defining a simple function, and executing a run method. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The use of the 'mcp' framework might be for testing or demonstration, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a module, initializes it with a parameter, and defines a simple tool function returning a static string. There are no user inputs, external data, or network communications. The code structure is typical for a basic plugin or extension pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign example of defining and running a tool within the 'mcp' framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to serve a demonstration purpose.",
