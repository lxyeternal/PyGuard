{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an instance of FastMCP from the mcp.server.fastmcp module, registers a simple tool function that returns a greeting, and runs the MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only uses local class instantiation and a function definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data leaks, network communication, or any untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply defines and registers a function and runs a server.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It relies on the mcp library, which is assumed to be legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server class from a third-party library and creates an instance. It defines a simple function decorated as a tool, returning a static greeting string. The script then executes the server run method. There are no indications of data collection, network activity beyond the server startup, or malicious code. The code is minimal, clean, and typical of a simple server setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a straightforward setup for an MCP server with a test tool function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
