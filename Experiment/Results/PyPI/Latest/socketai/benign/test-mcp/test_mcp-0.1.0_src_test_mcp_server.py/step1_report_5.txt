{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a FastMCP object and defines a tool function 'hello_world' that returns a greeting string, then runs the MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it only creates an object, defines a function, and runs a server.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data are present; the code only returns a static string.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the function 'hello_world' outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an imported class 'FastMCP' and its method 'tool' but does not perform any suspicious operations, data handling, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'FastMCP' from a module, instantiates it with a string argument, defines a simple tool function returning 'Hello World!', and runs the server if executed directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended for a demonstration or service setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple server setup defining a 'hello world' tool without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security threats based on the provided code.",
