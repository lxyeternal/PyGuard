{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a FastMCP object, defines a tool function that returns a greeting, and runs the MCP server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a module and creates an object with a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external locations or invoke untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials beyond the simple string, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'FastMCP' from an external module, creates an instance with a string parameter, defines a tool function that returns 'Hello World!', and runs the server if executed as the main module. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors observed. The usage appears straightforward and benign, relying on the imported 'mcp.server.fastmcp' module. Without insight into that external module's internal behavior, the code itself appears non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic setup for a FastMCP server with a simple tool function. No malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no indicators of sabotage are present within this code. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
