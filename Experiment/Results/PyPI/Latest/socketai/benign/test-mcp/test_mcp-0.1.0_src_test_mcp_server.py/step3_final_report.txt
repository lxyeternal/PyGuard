{
  "purpose": "A simple MCP server setup with a test tool function, intended for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No external untrusted input; uses internal class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network transmissions, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No external source-to-sink data flows; static return value in the tool function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, readable code with placeholder string 'DummyTestMCP'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library, creates an instance with a test name, registers a simple function returning 'Hello World!', and runs the server. No external input, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The external library's internal behavior is unknown, but based on this snippet, no malicious or risky activity is evident. The code appears benign, intended for testing or demonstration. No obfuscation, secrets, or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test setup for an MCP server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores and evaluations in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
