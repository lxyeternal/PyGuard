{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple module that uses the FastMCP class from the mcp.server.fastmcp package to create a tool that returns 'Hello World!'. It appears intended for some form of microservice or plugin system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the instantiation of FastMCP and the call to mcp.tool(), but no external untrusted input is explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code executes mcp.run(), which may initiate network operations or other actions depending on the implementation of FastMCP, but no direct data leaks or dangerous operations are evident here.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating an MCP instance, registering a tool, and running the MCP system. There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The string 'DummyTestMCP' is a placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external package and uses it to define a tool function that returns a static string. The package 'mcp.server.fastmcp' could perform various operations, but based solely on this code, there are no indications of malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded string 'DummyTestMCP' is typical for testing or placeholder purposes. The structure is straightforward, with no complex or suspicious constructs. There are no evident attempts at obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign implementation for defining and running an MCP tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
