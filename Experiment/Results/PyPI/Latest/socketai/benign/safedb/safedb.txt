      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, functional database implementation with no malicious behavior detected. The primary security issue is the unsafe use of pickle, which can be exploited if data integrity is compromised. All reports' scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, justified by the pickle vulnerability and thread management considerations."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis. Further review of the 'database' module content is recommended for comprehensive security assurance, but based solely on this snippet, no action is necessary."
