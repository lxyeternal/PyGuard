  "purpose": "Importing the SDB class or object from the local database module",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module named 'database', potentially reading code and resources related to database operations",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line; no external output or data leak points",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this single line; it only establishes an import relationship",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing 'SDB' from a local module named 'database'. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other operations that could pose security risks. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are visible in this fragment. Without additional context or code, the assessment is limited to the import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of standard module usage.",
