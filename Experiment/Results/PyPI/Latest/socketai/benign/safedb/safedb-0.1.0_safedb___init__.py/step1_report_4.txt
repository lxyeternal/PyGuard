{
  "purpose": "Import the SDB class or object from the local database module, likely for database operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'database' module within the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this single line of code; no data is being output or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow is observable in this isolated line; further code needed to determine data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple relative import; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are evident in this line.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of 'SDB' from the 'database' module. It appears standard and does not contain any malicious constructs. No data handling, user input, or network communication is visible. As a single line, it provides no suspicious behavior but cannot rule out malicious intent without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no immediate signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears benign, assuming the imported module is legitimate.",
