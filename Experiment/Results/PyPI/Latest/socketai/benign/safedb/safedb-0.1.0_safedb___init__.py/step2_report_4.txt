  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a simple import statement: `from .database import SDB`. There are no indications of code execution, dynamic behavior, or data manipulation. The code is minimal and appears benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**  \nThe reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward import statement with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. They consistently note the lack of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical errors are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Recommendations**  \n- **Confidence** scores are mostly high (0.8–0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated** scores are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Malware** scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **SecurityRisk** scores are mostly low (0.1–0.2). Given the import alone, this is reasonable. However, if the 'database' module is malicious, the risk could be higher, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nNo report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate. The import statement itself is not risky; any higher score would require evidence of malicious intent or code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. Without additional context, there's no reason to suspect malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent; they acknowledge the need for further context.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a benign import statement.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score can stay low unless further context indicates otherwise.\n- Given the potential for malicious modules, an additional review of the 'database' module itself would be prudent in a real-world scenario, but based solely on this snippet, no change is necessary.\n\n**Estimated scores based on this analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to keep a cautious low risk, but it could be 0 if desired)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The current scores are appropriate.",
