  "purpose": "Import the SDB class or object from a local module named database.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'database.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flows in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statement; no anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or object 'SDB' from a relative module 'database'. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors within this single import statement. The code is minimal, and no other context is provided. Without further code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent. The import could be legitimate or part of malicious activity if the 'database' module contains harmful code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior. It does not pose security risks by itself, but further review of the 'database' module is necessary to ensure its safety.",
