  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .database import SDB`.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The import is straightforward and standard, with no immediate security concerns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that, based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious behavior or security risk.\n   - Some reports mention that further context (e.g., contents of the 'database' module) is necessary to fully assess security implications, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Suggestions:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of a simple import.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), reflecting the understanding that this is a benign import.\n   - **Recommendation:** The security risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0 in all cases since no suspicious activity is indicated, and the malware scores are already zero.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are at or below 0.2.\n   - This is appropriate because the code snippet alone does not suggest any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - This is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports rightly note that without further context, malicious intent cannot be confirmed or denied.\n   - No assumptions about the 'database' module are made; the assessment remains conservative and cautious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk based on this snippet)\n\n**Overall, this is a benign import statement with no security issues.**  \nFurther review of the 'database' module could be warranted if additional context reveals malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, no action is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. I would recommend lowering the security risk scores to 0 across all reports for consistency, but overall, the assessments are sound.",
