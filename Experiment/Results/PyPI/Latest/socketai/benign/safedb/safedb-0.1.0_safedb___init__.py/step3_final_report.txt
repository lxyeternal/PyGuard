  "purpose": "Import the SDB class from the local database module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this is a static import statement with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static import statement importing SDB from a local module named 'database'. There are no signs of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The import is standard and benign. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the lack of suspicious activity. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the 'database' module itself, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the analysis. Further review of the 'database' module content is recommended for comprehensive security assurance, but based solely on this snippet, no action is necessary.",
