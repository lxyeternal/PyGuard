{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the amount of available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "Reading from the 'psutil' library for system memory information and directly from '/proc/meminfo' file.",
  "sinks": "Returning the calculated available memory; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Imports 'psutil' and attempts to access system info; fallback reads '/proc/meminfo'; returns memory value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handlers that silently ignore errors; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine available system memory using the 'psutil' library. If unavailable, it reads '/proc/meminfo' directly. Both methods are standard approaches. Exception handling is broad but benign, suppressing errors silently. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical system info retrieval patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard methods to retrieve available memory and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
