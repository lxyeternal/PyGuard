  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function `get_available_memory_gb()` retrieves available system memory in GB.\n- It first tries to use `psutil.virtual_memory().available`.\n- If that fails (e.g., `psutil` not installed), it reads `/proc/meminfo` and parses the `MemAvailable` line.\n- Broad exception handling is used, silently ignoring errors.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5** all consistently describe the code as a standard system utility function with no malicious intent. They note the use of `psutil` and fallback to `/proc/meminfo`, and mention the broad exception handling as a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n**Common points:**\n- No external data leaks or external sinks.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns.\n- No obfuscation.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1).\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Recommendations\n\n1. **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n   - Yes, the code matches the descriptions and logic provided.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.  \n   - The use of broad exception handling is noted as a minor flaw but not malicious.  \n   - No inaccuracies are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correct.\n   - Security risk: mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.  \n   - The code is a benign utility; no elevated risk justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - No malicious activity detected; malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, standard utility function for retrieving system memory info. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The broad exception handling is a minor flaw but not malicious.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Category          | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | 0      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with reports) |\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The minimal security risk is due to the broad exception handling which could mask errors, but this does not pose a security threat.\n- No need to increase malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores; the code is safe and non-malicious.",
