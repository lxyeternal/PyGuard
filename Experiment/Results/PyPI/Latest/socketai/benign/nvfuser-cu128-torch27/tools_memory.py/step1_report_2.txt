{
  "purpose": "The function retrieves the available system memory in GB, either via psutil or by reading /proc/meminfo.",
  "sources": "Imports psutil module; reads from /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Imports psutil, uses system file read, processes data locally without external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. Use of broad exception handling may hide errors but isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine available memory through psutil; if that fails, it reads /proc/meminfo directly. Both methods parse system data for available memory, with standard Python operations. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. No external network communications or potentially harmful system modifications are involved. The code is straightforward, with fallback mechanisms for different environments, and does not contain obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate system information retrieval task without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard utility function with no security risks.",
