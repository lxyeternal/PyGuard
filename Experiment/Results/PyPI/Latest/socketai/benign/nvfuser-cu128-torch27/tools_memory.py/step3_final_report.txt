  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in GB using psutil or /proc/meminfo.",
  "sources": "Reading system memory info via psutil or /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input sources: system calls / files; Output: return value of available memory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (`except:`) silently suppresses errors; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility to obtain available memory, with fallback mechanisms. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The broad exception handling could hide errors but is not malicious. No external data leaks or network activity. The code is standard and benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to exception handling. All reports correctly assess the benign nature and assign consistent scores. No modifications necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard system utility with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The overall security risk is very low. Minor concern about broad exception handling, but it does not constitute a security threat.",
