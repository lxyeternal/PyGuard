  "purpose": "Retrieve the amount of available system memory in GB.",
  "sources": "Reading system memory information via psutil library or /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing memory info; no untrusted data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input from psutil or /proc/meminfo → processing → return available memory in GB.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; no malicious or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to get available memory using psutil, a legitimate system monitoring library, then falls back to reading /proc/meminfo directly if psutil is unavailable. Both approaches are standard for gathering system memory info. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, well-commented, and uses common practices for system info retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for obtaining available system memory, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard techniques and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
