{
  "purpose": "To retrieve the available system memory in gigabytes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the psutil library and the /proc/meminfo file to determine available memory.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; the data retrieved is only used for returning memory info.",
  "flows": "Input from psutil or /proc/meminfo flows into calculations to convert raw data into GB, which is then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of broad except clauses without handling specific exceptions might be considered poor practice but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve available system memory using psutil, a legitimate library, falling back to reading /proc/meminfo if psutil is unavailable. The try-except blocks catch all exceptions silently, which could mask errors but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration activities. The code is straightforward and performs a standard system info retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function to obtain available memory information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
