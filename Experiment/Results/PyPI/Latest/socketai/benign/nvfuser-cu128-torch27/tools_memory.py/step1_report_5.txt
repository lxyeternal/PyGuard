{
  "purpose": "Retrieve available system memory in gigabytes, using either psutil library or /proc/meminfo file.",
  "sources": "Import of psutil library; reading from /proc/meminfo file",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if memory info is misused elsewhere; no direct sink present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import psutil -> get memory info -> return value; fallback to reading /proc/meminfo -> parse and return memory value",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling which suppresses errors silently; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to retrieve system memory info through psutil, a common library, then falls back to reading /proc/meminfo if psutil isn't available. Both methods are standard and do not contain malicious code. Exception handling is broad but only suppresses errors without side effects. No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function for system info retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for obtaining system memory info, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
