  "purpose": "Utility functions for querying CUDA device properties, mapping data types between PyTorch and nvFuser, and handling out-of-memory errors with retries.",
  "sources": "System CUDA libraries loaded via ctypes, torch.cuda for device info, and input data types for conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network communication; primarily internal system info and error handling.",
  "flows": "Loading CUDA libraries -> querying device attributes -> mapping data types -> retry decorator for OOM errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Minor syntax error in 'NumberTypeType' variable definition (missing closing bracket).",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GPU info retrieval, data type conversions, and error handling. It uses ctypes to load system CUDA libraries and queries device attributes via CUDA driver API. No malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. The only technical flaw is a syntax error in the 'NumberTypeType' variable, which prevents execution and should be fixed. The use of dynamic library loading is typical for such utilities and does not pose a security risk. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility module for GPU device info and data type handling. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The minor syntax error should be corrected for proper functionality. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is appropriate for use in GPU-accelerated Python projects.",
