{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling data types, device properties, and error handling in CUDA-enabled PyTorch environments, likely for performance or hardware querying purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads device properties via ctypes and torch.cuda, and converts data types using mappings. It does not read external user input, network data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that write untrusted data to external systems, files, or networks. The code interacts with CUDA libraries and performs internal data processing.",
  "flows": "Device property functions flow from CUDA library calls to internal data structures; type conversion functions map input types to internal enums; the decorator retries functions on OOM errors.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs. It loads standard CUDA libraries, uses common Python modules, and performs expected device queries. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard device property retrieval via ctypes and torch.cuda, including loading CUDA libraries and querying device attributes. It includes a retry decorator for handling OOM errors, which is typical for GPU programming. Type mapping functions are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses standard libraries and techniques, and all data handling appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility module for CUDA device querying and type handling in a PyTorch environment. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe to use in its current form.",
