  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing metadata comments, including SPDX identifiers and copyright notices, with no executable code or data flows.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source; no data input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as no code executes.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, since the code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static comment block with licensing information. No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present. The presence of only comments indicates no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The future date is likely a typo or placeholder. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
