{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module export for a package, specifically re-exporting the 'nn' submodule.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import nn' reads the 'nn' submodule from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code simply exports a submodule.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for Python packages; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a submodule 'nn' from the current package directory and exposes it via __all__, which is a typical pattern for package exports. No external data input, no sensitive data handling, no malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices are standard licensing annotations. The code is simple and does not contain any code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module declaration and export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package, with no anomalies or malware indications.",
