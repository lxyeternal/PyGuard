{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module initializer that imports and re-exports the 'nn' submodule, facilitating its accessibility when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import nn' reads the local 'nn' submodule; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the 'nn' submodule and exposing it via '__all__', with no data or control flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module export pattern with a license header, importing a local submodule 'nn' and exposing it via '__all__'. It contains no input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. The license comments are standard and do not influence runtime behavior. The simplicity and clarity of the code, along with the absence of suspicious patterns, indicate no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module that re-exports a submodule without any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
