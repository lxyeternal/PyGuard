{
  "purpose": "The code defines an __all__ list for module exports, specifically exporting 'nn' from the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import nn' as the primary data source",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output involved",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of the 'nn' module and its inclusion in __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard for Python packages",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module defining exports. It imports a local module 'nn' and specifies it for public API via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code structure is simple and typical for package initialization or module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package module defining exports with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages module visibility.",
