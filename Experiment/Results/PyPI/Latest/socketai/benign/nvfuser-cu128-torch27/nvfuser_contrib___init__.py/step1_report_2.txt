  "purpose": "Defines a Python module exporting the 'nn' submodule for neural network functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'nn' submodule from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports 'nn' from the local package and makes it available in __all__, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license comment, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The license comment indicates proprietary rights but does not influence security. The structure is minimal and standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports a submodule, adhering to common Python packaging practices.",
