  "purpose": "Store a version string identifier for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string value to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The string includes a git commit hash suffix '+gitbfc7ba8', which indicates version control metadata, but this is common in development or release metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable. The version string includes a semantic version number with an additional git commit hash suffix, which is a standard way to denote a specific build or state of the code. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, input handling, or other risky patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a version string variable with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical metadata assignment in a Python package or module.",
