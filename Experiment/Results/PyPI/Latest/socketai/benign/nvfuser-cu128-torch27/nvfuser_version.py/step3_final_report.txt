  "purpose": "Assigns a version string with a git commit hash suffix, serving as metadata for the package version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the version string; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the version string includes a git hash suffix, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to a variable, representing the package version with a commit hash. No dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data flows are present. The inclusion of a git hash suffix is common in versioning and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no obfuscation or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version string assignment with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
