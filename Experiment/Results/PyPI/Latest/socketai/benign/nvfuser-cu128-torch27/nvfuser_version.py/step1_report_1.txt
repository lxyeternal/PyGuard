  "anomalies": "Contains a version string with a local identifier (+gitbfc7ba8), which is common in version control metadata. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string that includes a version number and a git commit hash suffix. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious code behavior. The format is typical for versioning in software projects. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version string assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
