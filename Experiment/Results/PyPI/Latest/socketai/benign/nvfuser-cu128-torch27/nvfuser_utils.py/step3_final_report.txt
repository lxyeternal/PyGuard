{
  "purpose": "Constructs a resource path for 'nvfuser' by navigating two directories up from the current file and appending specific subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and uses os.path functions to determine the directory structure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are used; the code does not lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used to generate a static path without any data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os', defines a list '__all__', and constructs 'cmake_prefix_path' by joining directory paths relative to __file__. It performs static path setup without user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is typical for configuration purposes in open-source projects, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple, static resource path setup. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
