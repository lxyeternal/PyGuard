  "purpose": "Define a file path to the 'nvfuser' directory within a specific project structure.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory via '__file__' and os.path functions to construct a path.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__) -> os.path functions -> 'cmake_prefix_path' variable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. Use of standard os.path functions is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os', sets a module export list '__all__', and constructs a directory path 'cmake_prefix_path' based on the current file's location. It uses 'os.path.dirname' twice to go up two directory levels, then appends specific subdirectory paths. The SPDX license comments are standard for open-source projects and do not impact security. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. The code performs a simple, safe path construction without any dynamic execution or external input processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration or setup snippet for project directory referencing. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
