  "purpose": "Define a file-level constant path to a 'nvfuser' share directory based on the script's location.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__) to determine the script's directory, then navigate two levels up and append specific subdirectory segments.",
  "sinks": "The constructed path is stored in the variable 'cmake_prefix_path'. No data flow leads to untrusted sinks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code derives a directory path from the script's location and assigns it to a variable; no input-output or data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for path setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and constructs a path by navigating two levels up from the current script's directory, then appends specific subdirectories. It is a typical setup for locating project resources or configuration files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The code does not process user input, access environment variables insecurely, or perform network operations. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet intended to set a file path for project resources. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns identified.",
