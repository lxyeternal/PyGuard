  "purpose": "Define a file path based on the current file's directory structure for use in configuring or locating resources related to 'nvfuser'.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The code reads the current file's path (__file__) and constructs a directory path; there are no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward path construction without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module, defines a list __all__, and constructs a path 'cmake_prefix_path' relative to the script's location. It uses os.path.dirname twice to go up two directory levels from the current file, then joins subdirectories. No input validation, no data leaks, no malicious imports, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard setup for resource locating within a project.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code snippet primarily used for setting up resource paths. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present. It is a standard path construction routine for project configuration.",
