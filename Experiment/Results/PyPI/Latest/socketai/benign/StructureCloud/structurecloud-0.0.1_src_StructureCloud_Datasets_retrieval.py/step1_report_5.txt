  "purpose": "A class for loading and formatting StructureCloud datasets from Hugging Face datasets library.",
  "sources": "load_dataset function call, data['position'], data['node_class'], data['unitcell'], data['labels']",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Data is loaded via load_dataset, then formatted by user-defined functions, with no external data sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dataset object, loads dataset data from Hugging Face with flexible arguments, and formats data with user-supplied functions. No network communications, no file writing, no cryptographic operations, or other suspicious activities are present. The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and practices for dataset handling. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign dataset loader with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
