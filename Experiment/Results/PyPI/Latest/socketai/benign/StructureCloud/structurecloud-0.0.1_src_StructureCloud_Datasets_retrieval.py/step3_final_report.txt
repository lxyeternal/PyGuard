  "purpose": "A dataset loader class that fetches and formats data from Hugging Face's datasets library for StructureCloud datasets.",
  "sources": "Dataset loading via load_dataset, reading data entries such as 'position', 'node_class', 'unitcell', and 'labels'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network transmissions; data is loaded and returned locally.",
  "flows": "Dataset is loaded from Hugging Face, data entries are formatted with user-defined functions, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dataset loader that uses standard libraries and practices. It handles multiple dataset splits gracefully, formats data via user-supplied functions, and performs no external communication or data exfiltration. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The minimal print statement for multiple splits is benign. The use of user-defined formatting functions introduces no security risk as they are controlled by the user. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dataset loader with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect no malware presence (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (0 or 0.1). The minimal security risk score of 0.1 used in some reports is justified but could be lowered to 0, given the benign nature.",
