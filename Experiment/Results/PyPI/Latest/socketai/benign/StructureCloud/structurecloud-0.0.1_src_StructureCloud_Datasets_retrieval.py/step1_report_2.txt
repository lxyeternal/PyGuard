  "purpose": "To load and process datasets from the StructureCloud collection for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "load_dataset function from the datasets library, accessing dataset_name attribute, data['position'], data['node_class'], data['unitcell'], data['labels']",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network communications.",
  "flows": "Dataset loaded via load_dataset -> data retrieved at specific index -> data fields reformatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution or external command invocations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataset loader class that fetches data from Hugging Face datasets, specifically from the StructureCloud dataset. It reformats data fields using user-defined or default functions and returns the processed data. No network communication beyond dataset loading, no data leaks, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of print statements is benign, intended for debugging or informational purposes. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dataset loading utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions, data exfiltration, or system modification. The overall security risk is minimal.",
