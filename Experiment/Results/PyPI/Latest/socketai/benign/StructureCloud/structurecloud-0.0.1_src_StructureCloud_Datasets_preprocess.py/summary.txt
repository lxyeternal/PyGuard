  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured dataset utility module with no malicious intent. The minimal security risk associated with pickle serialization is acknowledged but acceptable in controlled contexts. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) reflects serialization concerns without indicating malicious activity."
