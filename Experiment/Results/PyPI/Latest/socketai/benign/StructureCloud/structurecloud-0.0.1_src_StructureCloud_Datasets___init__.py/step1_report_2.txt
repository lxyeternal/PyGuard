  "purpose": "Import the StructureCloudDataset class from a local module named retrieval",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module retrieval",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to the import process; no runtime data flow or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no suspicious or unusual code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module, indicating modular code organization. No data processing, input reading, or external data handling is visible. The imported class might be used elsewhere, but based solely on this line, there are no signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks apparent. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured project.",
