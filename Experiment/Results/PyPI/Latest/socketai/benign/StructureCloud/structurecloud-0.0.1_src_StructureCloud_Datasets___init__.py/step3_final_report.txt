{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'StructureCloudDataset' from a local module 'retrieval', serving as a dependency or component within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only performs a static import without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is a standard import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard relative import in Python, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The slight variation in risk score (0.1) in one report appears conservative and unwarranted given the simplicity of the code. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is to import a class, which is a common and safe operation. The scores are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate and consistent. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting the safe nature of this code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
