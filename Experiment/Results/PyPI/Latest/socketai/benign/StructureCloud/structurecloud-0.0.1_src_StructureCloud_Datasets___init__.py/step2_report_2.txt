  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Findings:** The code is a simple import statement. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity detected.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Findings:** Same as above; a straightforward import with no signs of malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Findings:** Again, just an import statement with no suspicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Findings:** Similar import statement, minimal and benign. Slightly lower confidence (0.8) and a small securityRisk score (0.1), perhaps reflecting a cautious approach.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n   - **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The small securityRisk might be a conservative placeholder; it’s reasonable.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Findings:** Same as previous; standard import statement, no anomalies.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Since the code is purely an import statement with no execution or data processing, the security risk should be minimal.\n\n**However,** the only slight deviation is in Report 4, which assigns a small securityRisk score of 0.1. This could be a conservative placeholder, but without any actual suspicious activity, even that seems unnecessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate. The minimal risk score of 0.1 in Report 4 seems unwarranted unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Appropriate |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Appropriate |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Appropriate |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Slightly conservative; recommend 0 |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Appropriate |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign.**  \n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard import statement with no security concerns.",
