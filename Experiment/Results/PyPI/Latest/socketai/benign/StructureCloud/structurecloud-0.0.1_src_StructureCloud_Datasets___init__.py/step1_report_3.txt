{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'StructureCloudDataset' from a relative package 'retrieval', likely used for data handling or processing within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating data or code is sourced from a module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this minimal snippet; it only imports a class from another module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal with no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "This fragment consists solely of an import statement importing 'StructureCloudDataset' from a local module '.retrieval'. There is no code execution, data handling, or external communication. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import statement as part of a larger, benign codebase.",
