  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement; no malicious activity, data flow, or anomalies.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; just an import statement with no suspicious activity.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Similar minimal import statement.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** Slightly higher confidence (0.8) and a small security risk (0.1) assigned, perhaps due to cautious reasoning.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the cautious approach.\n   - **Justification:** Since it's just an import, no actual malicious activity is present, so the risk score should remain low or zero.\n   - **Recommendation:** Consider lowering the risk score to 0 unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same benign import statement.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are generally zero, with the exception of report 4, which assigns 0.1 — perhaps overly cautious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in report 4. Given the code's simplicity, the risk should be 0 unless there's contextual suspicion.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code being a benign import statement with no security concerns.",
