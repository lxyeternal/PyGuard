{
  "purpose": "Importing the StructureCloudDataset class from a local retrieval module",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module named 'retrieval' and accesses 'StructureCloudDataset'",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it is only an import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it only performs a module import",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import statement with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing 'StructureCloudDataset' from a relative module named 'retrieval'. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing shown. The code does not include any suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. It is a common pattern in Python projects to import components for later use.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign import typical in modular Python code.",
