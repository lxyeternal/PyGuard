  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'RL_Environ'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' script reads package metadata and dependencies via 'setuptools' functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data output.",
  "flows": "The script executes static setup functions with predefined parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal and standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup script utilizing 'setuptools' to define package metadata. It uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules and specifies an empty 'install_requires' list. No external input, user data, or potentially dangerous code execution paths are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a conventional package setup script with no security concerns.",
