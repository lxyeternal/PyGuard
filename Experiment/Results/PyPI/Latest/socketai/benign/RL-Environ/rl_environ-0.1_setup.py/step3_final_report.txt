  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'RL_Environ' project.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, call to find_packages(), static arguments in setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup.py script that imports setuptools, defines package name and version, discovers packages with find_packages(), and specifies an empty install_requires list. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscated or malicious patterns. All security signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature and justified by the absence of any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
