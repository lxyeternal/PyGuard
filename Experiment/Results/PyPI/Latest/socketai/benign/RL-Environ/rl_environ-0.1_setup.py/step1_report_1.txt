  "purpose": "Configure package setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata and dependencies from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "The code loads package information and dependencies into the setup process; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, specifies package name and version, finds packages automatically, and has an empty dependencies list. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious external calls are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
