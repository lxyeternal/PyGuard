  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'RL_Environ', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information, package discovery, and dependency requirements via 'setup' and 'find_packages()'.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sources; standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for packaging, calling 'setup' with basic metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No malicious functions or obfuscated code present. Dependencies list is empty, indicating no external dependencies are declared. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, standard setup script without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard boilerplate code for packaging.",
