{
  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'RL_Environ' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and the package list via find_packages(). No input or external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply supplies metadata for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The code uses standard setup syntax with no dynamic execution or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools' functions, specifies package name, version, and dependencies (empty). It uses find_packages() to automatically discover packages, which is common practice. There are no input reads, no code execution beyond importing modules, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
