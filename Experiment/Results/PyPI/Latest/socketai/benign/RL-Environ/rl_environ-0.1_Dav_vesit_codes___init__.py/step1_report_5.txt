{
  "purpose": "Import the 'acf' function or variable from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'main' when executed, which could contain further code or data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this line; depends on 'main' module contents.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'main' module, then retrieves 'acf' from it; potential for malicious behavior depends on 'main' module's code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a relative import statement. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import, which is common in package structures. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this fragment alone. However, the safety depends on the contents of 'main.py' and the 'acf' element. Without inspecting 'main', cannot definitively rule out malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement by itself is not inherently malicious but relies on the contents of 'main.py'. No immediate security issues are evident from this snippet alone.",
