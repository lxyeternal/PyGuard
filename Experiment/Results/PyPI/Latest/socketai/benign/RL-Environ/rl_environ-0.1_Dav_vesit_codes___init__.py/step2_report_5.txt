  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement. No issues are present.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All scores (benign, malware, risk) are zero, which is appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior, so scores are reasonable.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No security concerns.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; minimal import statement.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly less (0.9), but still high.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a simple import.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or security issues detected.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The import depends on the contents of `main.py`.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** The report correctly notes that malicious behavior could depend on `main`.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - `malware`: 0 — appropriate given no evidence of malicious code in the snippet.  \n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2 — perhaps slightly overcautious, but since the code depends on `main.py`, which could contain malicious code, a small risk score is justifiable.  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n- **Justification:** Since the import itself is benign, but the actual security depends on the contents of `main.py`, a low risk score is reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no report assigns high malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The only point of contention is report 5's small security risk score, which is acceptable given the dependency on external code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the dependency on external code (`main.py`), a small risk (around 0.1-0.2) is reasonable, but not higher.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 — acknowledging that the import could be malicious if `main.py` is malicious, but based solely on this snippet, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
