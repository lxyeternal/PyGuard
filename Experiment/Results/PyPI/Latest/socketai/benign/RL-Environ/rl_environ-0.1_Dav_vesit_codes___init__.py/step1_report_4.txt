  "purpose": "Import the 'acf' function or object from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'acf' from a relative module './main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; only a module import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a relative import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'acf' from a local module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. The import is straightforward and standard for Python projects. Due to the limited context, there is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is typical for Python package structure and contains no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard in Python projects and appears safe.",
