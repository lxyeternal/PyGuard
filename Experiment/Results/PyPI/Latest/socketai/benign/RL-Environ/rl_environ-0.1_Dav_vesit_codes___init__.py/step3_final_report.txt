  "purpose": "A simple relative import of 'acf' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "None; the import is static and does not involve runtime data flow in this context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .main import acf'. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or insecure constructs. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of 'main.py' and the 'acf' object/function. Since the snippet is isolated and standard, it is benign. The reports correctly identify this, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk score (0.2) in report 5 is justified due to dependency on external code, which could be malicious if 'main.py' is compromised. Confidence in the benign nature of this snippet is high (close to 1), but the overall security depends on the external module.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and standard; no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external 'main.py' content, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.",
