{
  "purpose": "The code provides implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms and environments, including grid-world, bandit problems, policy evaluation, and Monte Carlo methods, primarily for educational or experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-defined initial states, environment states, and random number generators; environment interactions generate state transitions and rewards. No external data or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs include visualizations saved as PNG files, print statements for debugging, and plots; no data exfiltration, network communication, or file system modification beyond saving images is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment interactions (states, rewards) into learning algorithms (Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo), which update internal models or value estimates; results are visualized or printed. There are no flows leading to external network communication or external system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. All code is consistent with reinforcement learning experiment implementations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden malicious functions are present. Use of plotting libraries and display functions is typical for analysis scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of multiple independent segments implementing RL environments and algorithms such as Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo, policy evaluation, and value iteration. All functions perform standard RL tasks: environment simulation, value updates, policy derivation, and visualization. No code attempts to read or exfiltrate untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations, file system manipulation beyond image saving, or system commands. The presence of plotting and visualization is typical for research code. Usage of random number generators is for simulation purposes, not malicious activities. The code is complex but consistent with standard RL educational implementations, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of reinforcement learning simulation and visualization scripts with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard educational or research code for RL algorithms. No indications of sabotage, malware, or malicious data leakage are present.",
