{
  "purpose": "The code contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms and environments, primarily for educational and research purposes, including grid-world, bandit problems, Monte Carlo methods, value iteration, and policy evaluation.",
  "sources": "Environment state variables, random number generators for simulation, input parameters, and visualization functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed results and generated plots; no external data transmission or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally between environment simulation, RL algorithms, and visualization routines; no external communication or data leaks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors identified. The code is straightforward and standard for RL research and education.",
  "analysis": "All code snippets are standard RL implementations with clear structure, libraries, and functions. No signs of malicious activity such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Visualization libraries are common and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with the code content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard RL algorithms and environments used for research and educational purposes. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
