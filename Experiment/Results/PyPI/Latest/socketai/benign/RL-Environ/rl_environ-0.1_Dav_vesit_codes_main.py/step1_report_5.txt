{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of reinforcement learning and dynamic programming implementations, including grid-world environments, bandit algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and policy evaluation techniques, primarily for educational and experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user-defined initial states, performs random action selection, and generates random rewards and environment states. It also reads from external modules like numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, and IPython.display.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any network communications, file writes (beyond plotting images), or system modifications. No data leakage or unauthorized data transmission is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment state initialization and random reward generation (sources), through algorithm steps such as action selection, reward collection, and value updates (sinks). No untrusted external input or output manipulation is detected.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard libraries for simulations and visualization. No obfuscation, misleading variable names, or unusual language features are present. All parts serve typical reinforcement learning experiment functions.",
  "analysis": "The code includes multiple RL algorithms, environment simulations, and visualization routines. It uses standard Python practices and libraries for scientific computing and visualization. No malicious network activity, unauthorized system access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code’s structure and content align with academic or educational RL implementations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on a detailed review, the code does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a collection of standard RL and DP algorithm implementations intended for research or education. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious sabotage are evident.",
