{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement various reinforcement learning algorithms, including grid-world environments, bandit problems, policy evaluation, value iteration, Monte Carlo methods, and other RL techniques for academic or experimental purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include random number generators (np.random, random), environment state observations, and reward signals within environment step functions. No external untrusted input handling is observed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as plt.savefig(), plt.show(), and display(). No data leaks or external data exfiltration are present. No network activity or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment interactions (state, action, reward), through RL algorithms (Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo), to visualizations and printed outputs. No external data or untrusted inputs influence internal logic or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs, are present. All code is typical of standard RL implementations, with legitimate use of randomization and visualization libraries. No code injection, hidden code, or malicious side-effects are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard reinforcement learning environments and algorithms, including grid-worlds, bandit problems, policy evaluation, value iteration, and Monte Carlo methods. It uses typical Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and tqdm for visualization and progress tracking. The logic appears straightforward, consistent with educational or research purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage activities is found. The code performs simulations, data collection, and visualization without any suspicious network or system commands. The code structure and use of libraries are typical for RL experiments.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a collection of reinforcement learning simulations and visualizations, all appearing benign and aligned with academic or experimental RL applications. No malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code is safe for use, with no signs of malware or malicious behaviors.",
