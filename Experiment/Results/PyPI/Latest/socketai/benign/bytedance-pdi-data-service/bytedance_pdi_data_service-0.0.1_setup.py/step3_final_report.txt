{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, serving as a placeholder to mitigate dependency confusion risks.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> executes setup() with static data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that imports setuptools, reads a local README file, and defines package metadata. It does not contain dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The purpose is explicitly to serve as a placeholder package to prevent dependency confusion. All signals indicate benign, static configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
