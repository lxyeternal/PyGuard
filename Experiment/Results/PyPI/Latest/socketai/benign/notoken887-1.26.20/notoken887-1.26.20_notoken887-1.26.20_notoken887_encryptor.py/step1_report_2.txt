{
  "purpose": "The class TokenCryptor provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption for strings, mapping characters to emojis and other symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'string' parameter in the encrypt method and 'encrypted_token' parameter in the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements without any external system calls, network communication, or file operations. There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('string' in encrypt and 'encrypted_token' in decrypt) through successive replace operations, resulting in transformed strings; no external or system calls are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using chained replace calls for substitution cipher. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns are present. The substitution cipher is insecure for cryptographic purposes but not malicious in intent.",
  "analysis": "The class performs character-by-character substitution for encryption and decryption, which is a basic encoding method. It does not involve external data sources, system commands, network operations, or cryptographically secure methods. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The simplicity suggests it is intended for obfuscation rather than security. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple substitution cipher implementation with no malicious intent. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leakage, or malicious network activity. It appears to be a benign encoding utility. The security risk is minimal but the encryption method is insecure for protecting sensitive data. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
