{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character substitution encryption and decryption functions for strings, transforming specific characters into emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt().",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the transformed strings; no external or untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace characters with emojis (encryption) -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> replace emojis with characters (decryption) -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward character substitution without external dependencies or network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two methods for character substitution encryption and decryption. Both functions perform direct string replacements. There are no external data sources, no user input handling within these methods, no network operations, and no obfuscation. The design is simple and static, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. It is a benign utility for reversible character mapping.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic character substitution utility with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve as a simple encoding/decoding mechanism, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
