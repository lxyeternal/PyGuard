{
  "purpose": "This class provides simple obfuscation for strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, effectively serving as an encoding/decoding utility.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to encrypt and encrypted_token passed to decrypt.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the methods operate solely on string transformations without external data or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into encrypt, where characters are replaced with emojis; output is the obfuscated string. The reverse occurs in decrypt.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses extensive string replacements for obfuscation but does not perform any suspicious activities such as network communication, file operations, or credential handling. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The method is purely for encoding/decoding purposes.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a character-to-emoji substitution cipher, providing a reversible encoding mechanism. There are no sources of external input aside from the provided strings. The code only manipulates strings with replace() calls, which are deterministic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. It does not interact with the filesystem, environment variables, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The use of extensive replacements might be intended to obscure data, but this is a benign form of obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character-to-emoji substitution cipher used for simple encoding and decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or backdoors. It is likely intended for obfuscation or aesthetic encoding rather than malicious activity.",
