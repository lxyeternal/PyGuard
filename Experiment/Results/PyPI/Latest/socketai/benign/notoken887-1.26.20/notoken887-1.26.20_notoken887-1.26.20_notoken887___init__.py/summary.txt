  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. Reports with no code are correctly scored at zero. Benign code is appropriately rated low. Suspicious code, especially in report 5, warrants high scores, which are supported by the described red flags. Minor adjustments could include slightly increasing malware scores if further evidence confirms malicious activity, but current scores are reasonable."
