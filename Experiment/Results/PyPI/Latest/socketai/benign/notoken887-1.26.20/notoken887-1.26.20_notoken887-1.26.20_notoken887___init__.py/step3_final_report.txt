  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data input functions, environment variable reads, network calls, import statements, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "File operations, network transmissions, environment variable access, potential data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to potentially dangerous functions like eval/exec, network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, suspicious import patterns, obfuscation indicators, lack of documentation, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent in reports 1, 3, and 4, making analysis impossible; scores of zero are appropriate. Report 2 describes benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, justifying low scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2). Report 5 indicates dynamic code execution, unvalidated inputs, suspicious imports, and obfuscation, with high confidence (0.8). The scores (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.75) are justified given these red flags. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with minor room for slight adjustments if more details confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. Reports with no code are correctly scored at zero. Benign code is appropriately rated low. Suspicious code, especially in report 5, warrants high scores, which are supported by the described red flags. Minor adjustments could include slightly increasing malware scores if further evidence confirms malicious activity, but current scores are reasonable.",
