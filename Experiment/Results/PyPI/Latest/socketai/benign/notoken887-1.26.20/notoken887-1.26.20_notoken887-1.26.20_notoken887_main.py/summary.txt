  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscation utility with significant security risks due to runtime decryption and execution. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern of using exec() on decrypted code makes it susceptible to malicious exploitation if misused. The heavy obfuscation techniques further conceal potential malicious intent, but based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malware. The overall risk is moderate to high, primarily because of the unsafe execution pattern, warranting cautious use and further scrutiny of the external TokenCryptor."
