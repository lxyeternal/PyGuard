  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887', including package metadata, dependencies, and console entry point.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields (name, version, author, description, url), find_packages() for package discovery, entry_points for CLI script.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted input handling or data sinks identified in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code does not process or flow untrusted data; it's configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com', which could indicate malicious intent or unprofessional behavior; package description and URL are generic and unverified, but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious code flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and setup configuration. No input handling or dynamic code execution is present. The author email and URL appear suspicious but are not inherently malicious. The package's purpose is described as a test library for token encryption, with no apparent malicious functions or behaviors. The code follows standard setup conventions without anomalies in code structure or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with potentially suspicious metadata (author email, URL) but no malicious or security-compromising code detected. It appears to be a benign package setup script with some unprofessional details.",
