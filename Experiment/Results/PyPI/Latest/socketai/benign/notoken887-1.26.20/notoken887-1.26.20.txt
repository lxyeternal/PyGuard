      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign and standard, with suspicious contact info and URL that warrant caution. The main risk lies in the external module invoked by the entry point, which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the code is safe but the metadata and potential external code execution pose moderate risks."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and justified. Reports with no code are correctly scored at zero. Benign code is appropriately rated low. Suspicious code, especially in report 5, warrants high scores, which are supported by the described red flags. Minor adjustments could include slightly increasing malware scores if further evidence confirms malicious activity, but current scores are reasonable."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, reversible substitution cipher used for obfuscation or aesthetic encoding. There is no malicious activity, backdoor, or security vulnerability. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscation score around 0.2-0.3 to reflect the extensive replacements, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.1, indicating minimal threat."

      "security_risk": 0.6,
      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscation utility with significant security risks due to runtime decryption and execution. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern of using exec() on decrypted code makes it susceptible to malicious exploitation if misused. The heavy obfuscation techniques further conceal potential malicious intent, but based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malware. The overall risk is moderate to high, primarily because of the unsafe execution pattern, warranting cautious use and further scrutiny of the external TokenCryptor."
