  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches exactly the provided code snippet.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning correctly states that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the snippet.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report notes that the secret_key is stored and used directly without validation or obfuscation, which is standard practice, so not a flaw.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 — seems reasonable, considering the secret key handling is standard but the secret management outside this code is critical.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk is low, but since secret key management is outside the scope, a small risk score (0.2) is acceptable.  \n- **Scores:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious elements.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with the previous assessments.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, standard use of jwt library.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 — slightly lower risk, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.  \n- **Risk score:** The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, primarily around secret key management outside this code. These are reasonable.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The code is a standard JWT utility class, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this fragment.\n- The only potential concern is secret key management, which is outside the scope of this code but relevant in a real-world security context.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2) — I would assign a very low risk score, consistent with the reports, perhaps 0.1 to reflect minimal concern outside proper secret management.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard, and well-understood. No modifications needed.",
