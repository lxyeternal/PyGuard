{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with expiration times, likely for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "The secret_key provided during class initialization and the payload dictionary passed to encode_token.",
  "sinks": "The jwt.encode function which uses the secret_key and payload to generate a token.",
  "flows": "The secret_key and payload flow into jwt.encode to produce the JWT token.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions for JWT creation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JWTAuthHandler class with methods to encode payloads into JWT tokens. It copies the payload, adds an expiration timestamp, and encodes it using a provided secret key with the HS256 algorithm. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or external network interactions. The code appears to perform a standard JWT encoding process intended for authentication or session management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and uses standard practices for JWT token creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment.",
