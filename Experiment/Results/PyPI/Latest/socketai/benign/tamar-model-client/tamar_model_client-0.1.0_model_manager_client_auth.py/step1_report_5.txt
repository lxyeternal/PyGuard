{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for generating JWT tokens with expiration, likely for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "The secret_key parameter provided during class initialization; the payload dictionary input to encode_token method.",
  "sinks": "The jwt.encode function uses the secret_key and payload to generate a token, which can be used in authentication or data transfer.",
  "flows": "The secret_key and payload flow into jwt.encode to produce a token; payload is copied and augmented with expiration time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious operations are present. Usage of jwt library is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward JWT encoding class with a method to generate tokens. It accepts a secret key and payload, adds an expiration timestamp, and encodes it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The implementation appears standard and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign JWT token generator with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a typical authentication scenario.",
