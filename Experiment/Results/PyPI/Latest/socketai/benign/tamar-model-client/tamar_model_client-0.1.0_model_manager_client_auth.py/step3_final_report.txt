  "purpose": "A simple utility class for encoding JWT tokens with expiration.",
  "sources": "The payload dictionary provided to encode_token, and the external secret_key used for encoding.",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode() function, which outputs the JWT token; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input payload and secret_key flow into jwt.encode(), resulting in a token string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a class that encodes JWT tokens with an expiration claim, and uses the provided secret key. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is simple and aligns with common JWT practices. External secret management is outside this code's scope, but within the code, there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The overall structure and logic are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard JWT utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
