{
  "purpose": "The code defines a JWT authentication handler class for encoding JWT tokens with expiration.",
  "sources": "Input: secret_key (constructor parameter), payload (method parameter); also uses current time via time.time().",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode() function, which creates a token from payload and secret key.",
  "flows": "payload + exp (current time + expires_in) -> jwt.encode() -> token string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated elements. Use of standard jwt library and time functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a secret key, used for signing JWT tokens. The encode_token method copies the provided payload, adds an expiration timestamp based on current time, and encodes it with the secret key using HS256 algorithm. The code appears straightforward, following common practices for JWT creation. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, no hidden backdoors or data leaks. No external network access or sensitive data handling beyond token creation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a typical JWT token generator with expiration, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility class for authentication purposes.",
