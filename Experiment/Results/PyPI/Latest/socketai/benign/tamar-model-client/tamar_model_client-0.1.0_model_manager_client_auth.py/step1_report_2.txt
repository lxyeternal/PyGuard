{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for generating JWT tokens with expiration times, likely for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'payload' parameter in the encode_token method, which is a dictionary provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The jwt.encode function, which signs the payload using a secret key, potentially exposing or misusing the secret if improperly handled.",
  "flows": "Input payload → payload.copy() → adds 'exp' claim → jwt.encode signs the payload with secret_key → returns token",
  "anomalies": "The secret_key is directly stored and used without validation or obfuscation. The code does not validate or sanitize the payload input. No hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The class is straightforward: it encodes JWT tokens with an expiration claim. It uses the 'jwt' library for encoding. The secret key is provided externally, which is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or misuse of secrets. The code appears to serve a typical authentication function without suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT token generator with no evident malicious intent or security flaws. It does not contain backdoors or malicious data leaks. The only concern is proper management of the secret key outside this code, which is not shown here.",
