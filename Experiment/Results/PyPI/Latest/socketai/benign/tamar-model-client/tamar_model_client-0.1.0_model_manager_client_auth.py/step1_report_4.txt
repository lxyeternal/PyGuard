  "purpose": "A class to handle JSON Web Token (JWT) encoding with expiration support",
  "sources": "Input: secret_key parameter, payload parameter in encode_token method",
  "sinks": "jwt.encode function which generates a token using the secret key and payload data",
  "flows": "secret_key and payload -> jwt.encode -> generated token",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual data handling or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward JWT handling class with an encode method that adds an expiration claim to the payload and encodes it using the jwt library. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of a secret key supplied at runtime is standard practice. The code performs a common JWT encoding operation without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard JWT encoding utility with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It correctly handles token expiration and uses standard libraries without suspicious patterns.",
