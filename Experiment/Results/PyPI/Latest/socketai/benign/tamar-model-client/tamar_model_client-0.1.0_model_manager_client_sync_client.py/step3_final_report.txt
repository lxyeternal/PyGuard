  "purpose": "A synchronous wrapper around an asynchronous model management client, facilitating non-async environments with event loop management and cleanup routines.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from ModelRequest and BatchModelRequest objects; manages event loops and cleanup routines.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input requests are passed to the async client; event loop runs handle async invocation; cleanup routines close connections.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'nest_asyncio' for nested event loop compatibility, which can be misused but appears benign here; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for wrapping async clients into sync interfaces, managing event loops carefully, and ensuring cleanup via atexit. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The use of 'nest_asyncio' is typical for nested event loops but could be misused in other contexts; here, it is used solely for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured synchronous wrapper around an async client, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
