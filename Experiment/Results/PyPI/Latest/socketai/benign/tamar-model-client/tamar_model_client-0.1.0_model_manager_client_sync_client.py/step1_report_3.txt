{
  "purpose": "The code provides a synchronous wrapper around an asynchronous model management client, enabling its use in non-async environments such as Flask or Django.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters such as 'model_request' and 'batch_model_request' passed to methods 'invoke' and 'invoke_batch'. No external input is directly read from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into asynchronous client methods 'invoke', 'invoke_batch', and 'close'. The only data outputs are the responses from these methods, which are returned to the caller. No untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files directly from this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into client method calls, through async invocations, and back into synchronous return values. No untrusted data is processed or manipulated beyond parameter passing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no use of unsafe functions, or obfuscated code. Usage of 'nest_asyncio' is standard for handling nested event loops. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around an async client, managing event loops and providing sync interfaces. It uses standard asyncio patterns, proper exception handling, and resource cleanup via 'atexit'. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is detected. The functions appear to perform their intended tasks safely, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate wrapper for an async model management client. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with standard practices and do not suggest sabotage or malware.",
