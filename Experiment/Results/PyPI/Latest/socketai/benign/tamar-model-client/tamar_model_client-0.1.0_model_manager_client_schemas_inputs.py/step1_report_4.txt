  "purpose": "Define data models and validation logic for handling different provider-specific request types, including OpenAI, Google GenAI, and batch processing.",
  "sources": "Input data from API requests, environment variables (not explicitly shown), and external user inputs via model fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data assigned to model fields, used in validation checks, or passed to external APIs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into model fields, then through validation logic in 'validate_by_provider_and_invoke_type', which enforces correct fields based on provider and invoke type.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically validates fields based on provider and invoke type, which is complex but standard. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded data are present. No suspicious code injection, network calls, or system modifications are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. Validation logic is thorough but typical for such models.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with extensive validation logic tailored to provider and invocation type, ensuring only expected fields are accepted. It does not include any network operations, file system access, or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Validation checks ensure no illegal or unsupported fields are used. The dynamic validation approach is complex but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of structured request validation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of request models with dynamic validation based on provider and invoke type. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or sabotage signs are evident. It focuses on data validation and model correctness, with no suspicious activity detected.",
