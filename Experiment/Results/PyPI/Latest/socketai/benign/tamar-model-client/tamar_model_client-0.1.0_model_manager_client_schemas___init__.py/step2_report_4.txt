  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple module importing classes from local modules and defining an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No untrusted data handling, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and typical for schema definition modules.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 0.9 to 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, and the code is purely import/export declarations, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - **Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing solely on what the code actually does.\n   - No speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature: benign, static imports, no dynamic behavior, no external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** The code is a standard schema module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is purely structural, importing classes and defining an export list. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
