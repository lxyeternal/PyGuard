  "purpose": "This code defines and exports schema classes for an API, including input and output models.",
  "sources": "Imports schema classes from local modules (.inputs and .outputs).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code; only class imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward and consists solely of imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes for request and response schemas from local modules and then explicitly exports them via __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The structure is typical for schema definition files and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema definition module with no malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It serves to organize and expose data models for an API. No risks are identified.",
