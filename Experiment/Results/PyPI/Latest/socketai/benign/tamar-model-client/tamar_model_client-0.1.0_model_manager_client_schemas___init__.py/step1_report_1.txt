  "purpose": "Defines schema and exports for API input and output data structures",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.inputs and .outputs)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network or file operations, or data processing in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code segment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; straightforward import/export declarations",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes related to API schemas and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no data processing, user input handling, or external communication functions present. It appears to be a typical module setup for API schemas, with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for schema definitions and exports, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
