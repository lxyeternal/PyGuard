  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module importing schema classes and defining an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not include any malicious logic, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They appropriately dismiss concerns about malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the code justify a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely declarative, importing classes, with no runtime or external interactions.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard module defining and exporting schema classes for an API. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The high confidence scores reflect this straightforward assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary.",
