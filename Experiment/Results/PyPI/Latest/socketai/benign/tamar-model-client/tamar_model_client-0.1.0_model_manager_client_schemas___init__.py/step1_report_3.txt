  "purpose": "Define schema and import statements for API input/output data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules .inputs and .outputs.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A - simple import and export definitions with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of comments, import statements from local modules, and an __all__ list for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain logic that could be exploited. The imported modules suggest a structured schema setup, typical for API definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no embedded code, no external data handling, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module for defining and exporting API schemas. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It appears to be standard, benign code for schema organization.",
