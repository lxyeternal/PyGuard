  "purpose": "Define schema imports and expose specific classes for API input and output handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.inputs and .outputs).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an __all__ list declaration, which controls module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or external interactions. It appears to serve as a module interface or schema definition file. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward schema declaration and export configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
