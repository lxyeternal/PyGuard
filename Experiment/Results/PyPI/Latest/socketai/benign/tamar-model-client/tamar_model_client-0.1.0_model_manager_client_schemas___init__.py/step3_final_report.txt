{
  "purpose": "This code defines schema classes for an API, importing them from local modules and specifying exports via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.inputs and .outputs)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export declarations only",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or runtime data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and declarative",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema classes and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal, typical for schema definition modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static structure justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward schema module with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and the reports' analyses.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
