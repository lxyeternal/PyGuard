  "purpose": "Define and export schema classes for API inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.inputs' and '.outputs'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports class names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export statements, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a schema definitions module, importing specific classes from local modules and defining an export list. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external communications. The code is minimal and standard for Python modules, with no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for defining API schema exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
