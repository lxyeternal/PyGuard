  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a simple module importing classes from local modules and defining an `__all__` list for exports.\n- There are no signs of data processing, network communication, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The code appears to be standard for defining API schemas, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, no security risks are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very thorough and consistent; they all agree on the benign nature of this code.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, considering the code's content.\n- No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent, nor do they base their conclusions on assumptions.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward schema module with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are thorough and justified in their conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with my assessment.",
