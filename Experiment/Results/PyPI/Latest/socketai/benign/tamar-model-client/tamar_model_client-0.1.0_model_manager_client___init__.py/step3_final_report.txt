  "purpose": "Module exports classes and exceptions for external use, serving as an API surface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.sync_client, .async_client, .exceptions).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module with static imports and an __all__ list. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are consistent with the code's nature. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious features justify a minimal risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
