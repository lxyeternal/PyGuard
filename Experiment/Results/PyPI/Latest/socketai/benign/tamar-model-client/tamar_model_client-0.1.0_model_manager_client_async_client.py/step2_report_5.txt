  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. JWT token handling appears standard. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to general network communication)\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure. The code uses environment variables, standard JWT token generation, and gRPC communication. No malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious code, and responsible handling of sensitive data.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, highlights standard secure communication, proper token handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code's design and the report's observations are aligned. No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces the legitimacy of the code, standard environment variable usage, JWT tokens, and no malicious behaviors.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured client SDK.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard practices, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. It employs environment variables for configuration, JWT for authentication, and standard gRPC communication patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting general network communication and token handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Overall Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — the code is legitimate and secure.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, standard security considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured async gRPC client with no malicious intent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe and does not pose security risks beyond typical network and token management.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThe overall assessment confirms the code is legitimate, secure, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
