  "purpose": "Re-export enumeration types from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.channel, .invoke, .providers).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import from local modules to __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import/export module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list for re-exporting classes or constants. It contains no data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is straightforward and typical for module aggregation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign and simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports enum types with no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
