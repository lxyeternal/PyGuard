  "purpose": "Define and export enumerated types related to channels, invocation types, and providers for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .channel, .invoke, and .providers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; no data processing or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; import statements only load local modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific enumerations from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It acts as an index or aggregator for these enums, with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that imports and re-exports enumerations for use elsewhere. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
