  "purpose": "Define and export enumerated types related to channels, invocation types, and provider types for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .channel, .invoke, and .providers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects; purely import and export statements.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific classes and exports them via __all__, indicating a simple module for type enumeration. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or include suspicious logic. No security risks or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module defining and exporting enums for use elsewhere. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
