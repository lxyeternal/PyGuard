{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports enumerations or constants for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.channel, .invoke, .providers)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing or output generation present",
  "flows": "Importing modules and exporting names via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and primarily involves imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes or constants from local modules and defines the __all__ list to specify public exports. It contains no input handling, no data flow, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or malicious code. The structure is standard for Python packages to organize and expose API components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports imported enumerations or types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
