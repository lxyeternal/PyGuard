  "purpose": "Defines and exports enumeration types for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports enumeration classes from local modules: channel, invoke, providers",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or output",
  "flows": "Imports (sources) are re-exported via __all__ for external use; no data flow involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports enumeration classes and exposes them via __all__ for package exports. There are no suspicious patterns, no data handling, and no complex logic. It appears to be a simple, benign re-export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a re-export of enum types, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
