  "purpose": "The code defines and exports enumerated types for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .channel, .invoke, and .providers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to bring in enumerations, and __all__ exports them for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific enumerations from local modules and defines an export list. It appears to serve as a simple index or aggregator for these enums, with no data processing, external input handling, or risky operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely as a re-exporter of enumerated types. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
