  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python SDK, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading static package metadata, dependencies, package data, and README.md file.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data or input handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious elements. It reads static files, specifies dependencies, and package data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. All dependencies and package data are typical for such SDKs. The code does not process untrusted input, execute network operations, or contain hidden backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
