{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python SDK package named 'tamar-model-client' that facilitates interaction with a gRPC service.",
  "sources": "Reading package data with find_packages(), including package data files, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is used; the script mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the script primarily reads static files and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package information, dependencies, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no data processing that could be malicious. All dependencies are typical for a Python SDK project, and no suspicious patterns or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python SDK package with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks identified.",
