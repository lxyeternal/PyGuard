  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted input processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- The package dependencies and package data are typical for such SDKs.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The 'long_description' is read from a local README.md file, which is standard practice.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is straightforward and benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also confirms benign nature, standard packaging code.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, standard setup script.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same findings, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same consistent conclusion.\n- Scores: all zero, confidence=1.\n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No, the reasoning is consistent and sound.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable; all scores are zero, indicating no risks.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious behavior is identified, malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports base their conclusions on static code analysis and standard practices.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes, the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity of the reports and the code's straightforward nature, **my own estimate** aligns with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. All scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the risk scores should remain at 0 across all categories.",
