  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward and standard for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign and purely declarative.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are identified.\n   - The analysis is consistent and accurate regarding the code's purpose and content.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very low (0.1 for one report).\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The overall risk scores are consistent with the content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a high risk score.\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any external calls, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing solely on code content.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero levels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and typical for error handling.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
