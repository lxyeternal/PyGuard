  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to a Model Manager Client, including connection and validation errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. These classes serve to categorize errors in a model management context. There are no data input/output operations, external calls, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe definition of custom exceptions for error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
