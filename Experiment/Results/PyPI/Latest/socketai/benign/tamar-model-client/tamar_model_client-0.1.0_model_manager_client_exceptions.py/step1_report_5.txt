  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a Model Manager Client application",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are intended for error handling within a client application for a model management system. The classes are straightforward, with no embedded code execution, external data processing, or other suspicious behavior. The code appears clean and standard for exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for defining exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, non-obfuscated, and safe.",
