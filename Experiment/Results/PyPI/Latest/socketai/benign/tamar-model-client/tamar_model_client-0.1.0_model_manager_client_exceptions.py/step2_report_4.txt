  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a base exception class `ModelManagerClientError`.\n- Defines two subclasses: `ConnectionError` and `ValidationError`.\n- All classes inherit from `Exception` or the base class.\n- Contains descriptive docstrings.\n- No data handling, network operations, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions: simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None detected. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware` score = 0, which is appropriate.\n- `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- `obfuscated` is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- `confidence` is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that this code is purely for defining custom exceptions.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are reasonable, given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n- The overall security risk should be minimal, around 0.1 or less, which is consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it's error handling code, which could be exploited if misused, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes needed in scoring or interpretation.",
