  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a Model Manager Client application",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from Exception, with no external data input or output",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data, network operations, or external inputs",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares exception classes without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class inheritance with docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes to categorize errors such as connection failures and validation issues. It uses simple class inheritance from the base Exception class, including descriptive docstrings. No suspicious code, external data handling, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining custom exceptions for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe code intended for structured error management.",
