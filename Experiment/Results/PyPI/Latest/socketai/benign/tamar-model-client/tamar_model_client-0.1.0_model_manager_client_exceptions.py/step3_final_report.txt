  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a client application interacting with a Model Manager service.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance hierarchy; no external data input or output operations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception. It contains no dynamic code, data handling, network calls, or obfuscated constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and clarity confirm that it poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's content, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero levels.",
