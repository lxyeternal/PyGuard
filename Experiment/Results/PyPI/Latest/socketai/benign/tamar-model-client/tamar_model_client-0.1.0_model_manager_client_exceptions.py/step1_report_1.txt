  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Model Manager Client application",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading or external data sources)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network, or file operations)",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data handling operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base exception class 'ModelManagerClientError' and two subclasses for specific error cases: 'ConnectionError' and 'ValidationError'. All classes inherit from Exception or the base error class, with docstrings describing their purpose. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for custom exception definitions in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears to be benign and solely for error handling purposes.",
