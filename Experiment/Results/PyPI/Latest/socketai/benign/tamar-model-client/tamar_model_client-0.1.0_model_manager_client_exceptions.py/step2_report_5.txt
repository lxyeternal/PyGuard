  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is standard for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely declarative.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0 or 0.1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports might be a conservative default, but since there's no actual risk, a score of 0 would be more precise.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.1.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard exception definitions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple class definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores should remain at malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.",
