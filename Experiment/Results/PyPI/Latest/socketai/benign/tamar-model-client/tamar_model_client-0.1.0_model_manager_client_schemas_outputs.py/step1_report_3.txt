  "purpose": "Define data models for API responses using pydantic, including single and batch responses with optional fields for content, usage, raw data, errors, and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters and default values within class definitions, including class attributes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code that processes or executes untrusted input data directly.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in class attributes; no runtime data flow, external data handling, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of pydantic's flexible configurations is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models with optional fields for responses. It uses pydantic's BaseModel and ConfigDict for flexible type handling. There are no input processing, external data reads, or code execution paths. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious intent apparent. The models serve as structured data containers for API responses, which is common and expected in web applications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data models for API responses. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected. The code is typical for API response serialization with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
