{
  "purpose": "Define data models for handling responses from a model API, including individual and batch responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads type annotations, imports from 'typing' and 'pydantic', and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input sources to sensitive operations; data models are used for structured data representation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for structured data using pydantic's BaseModel. It specifies optional fields for response content, usage metrics, raw responses, errors, and identifiers. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive procedures. Usage of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' is standard for allowing complex types and does not introduce risk. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions for API responses without any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
