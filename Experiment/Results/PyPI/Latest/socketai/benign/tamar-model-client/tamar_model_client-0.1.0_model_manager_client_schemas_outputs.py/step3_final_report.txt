  "purpose": "Define data models for API responses, including content, usage, streaming, raw responses, errors, and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with optional fields; no external input or data sinks.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely data schema definitions without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with standard usage of Pydantic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Pydantic model classes for API responses, with optional fields for content, usage, streaming responses, raw responses, errors, and IDs. It uses 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' in ConfigDict, which is standard for complex types. No external input handling, network operations, or executable logic is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves as a typical API response schema. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of API response data models with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores and assessments across all reports are justified and accurate.",
