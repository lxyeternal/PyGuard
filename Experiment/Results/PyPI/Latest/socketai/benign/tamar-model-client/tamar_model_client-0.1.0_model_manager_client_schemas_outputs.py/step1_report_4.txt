{
  "purpose": "Define data models for responses from a machine learning model API, including handling of streaming, raw data, errors, and batch responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines data structures and imports, does not read input or data.",
  "targets": "None; the code does not include any sinks or data output that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this code only defines classes and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard data modeling practices with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints and pydantic for data validation, and defines several data models for API responses. All fields are optional and there are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The models include support for streaming responses, raw data, error reporting, and batch responses. No external inputs or outputs are processed within this code segment, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data modeling module for API responses with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
