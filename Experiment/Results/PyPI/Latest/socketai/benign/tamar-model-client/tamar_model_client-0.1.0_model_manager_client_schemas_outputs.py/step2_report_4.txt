  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a set of data model definitions using Pydantic.\n- No external data processing, network operations, or executable logic.\n- All fields are optional, with standard use of type annotations.\n- 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' is used in ConfigDict, which is typical for complex types but should be noted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines data models with no evident errors.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Security risks:** No external data handling, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; models are simple data containers.\n\n### Logical flaws or anomalies:\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n- Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed=True' is standard for flexible data models; no risk involved here.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is purely data model definitions, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The malware score should be **0** as no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated code score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the reports and code review, the scores are appropriate.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of data models for API responses. No security concerns or malicious activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain unchanged.",
