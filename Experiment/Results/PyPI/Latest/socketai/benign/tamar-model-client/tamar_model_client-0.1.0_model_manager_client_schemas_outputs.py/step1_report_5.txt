{
  "purpose": "Define data models for handling API responses, including single and batch responses, with support for flexible types and streaming data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, class attributes, and optional parameters within class definitions.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., response contents, errors, IDs) flows from data input points (class instantiations) to model attributes, but no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. Use of optional and Union types is standard in data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three data models inheriting from Pydantic's BaseModel, with configurations allowing arbitrary types. No data is handled insecurely; the models mainly serve as structured schemas. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of streaming responses and raw response fields does not introduce security risks in this context. The code is standard for API response modeling and does not include suspicious logic or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of response data models using Pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose as a schema definition.",
