  "purpose": "The code reads POSCAR files, processes string similarities, and loads parameters from a TOML file for materials science workflows.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for POSCAR and TOML files, string input for similarity checks, and parameter validation.",
  "sinks": "No external network or system modifications; data flows are confined to file I/O and in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "File input → data parsing and validation → string similarity calculations → parameter validation and selection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of debug print statements within string similarity functions; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file parsing with exception handling, coordinate transformations, and parameter validation. String similarity functions use character frequency vectors and cosine similarity, with debug print statements that could leak internal info but are not malicious. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for scientific data processing. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The exception handling is standard and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The debug print statements are harmless but could be removed in production. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.1–0.2 reflects minimal concern primarily due to debug output, which is acceptable. Overall, the code is low-risk and suitable for supply chain use in scientific applications.",
