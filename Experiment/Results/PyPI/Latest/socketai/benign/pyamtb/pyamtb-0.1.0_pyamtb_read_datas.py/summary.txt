  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The debug print statements are harmless but could be removed in production. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.1–0.2 reflects minimal concern primarily due to debug output, which is acceptable. Overall, the code is low-risk and suitable for supply chain use in scientific applications."
