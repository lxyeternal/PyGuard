  "purpose": "Defines a Parameters class for managing model parameters, supporting default and configuration file-based initialization.",
  "sources": "Configuration file read via read_parameters function, attribute assignments from the loaded data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration file (if provided) through read_parameters into class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the os module is imported but unused, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parameter management class with default and file-based initialization. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or handle sensitive data insecurely. The external function read_parameters is a dependency that could be malicious if compromised, but within this code, it appears as a standard configuration loader. No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present. The code's structure is clear, and all data handling is standard. The import of os is unused, which is harmless but could be cleaned up. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured parameter class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reliance on an external function is noted but does not indicate malicious intent within this snippet. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to external dependency concerns.",
