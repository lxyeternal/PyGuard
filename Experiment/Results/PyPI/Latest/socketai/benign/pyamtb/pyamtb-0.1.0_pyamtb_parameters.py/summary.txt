  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured parameter class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reliance on an external function is noted but does not indicate malicious intent within this snippet. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to external dependency concerns."
