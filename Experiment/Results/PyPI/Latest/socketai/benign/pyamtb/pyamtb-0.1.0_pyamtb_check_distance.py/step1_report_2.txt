{
  "purpose": "Calculate and display interatomic distances between specified elements in a POSCAR file, considering periodic boundary conditions.",
  "sources": "read_poscar function imported from local module; poscar_filename input parameter; environment variables indirectly via os.path (not used here); data read from the POSCAR file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks that could cause data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the read_poscar function to coordinate calculations, and then distances are computed and sorted; no external untrusted data influencing system behavior in a harmful manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward data processing and printing.",
  "analysis": "The script reads atomic structure data from a POSCAR file, computes all pairwise distances between two specified elements considering periodic boundary conditions, and sorts the results. It then aggregates and prints distance statistics. The code uses numpy for mathematical operations and appears to be well-structured without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No network activity, system modification, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate computational tool for analyzing atomic distances in materials simulations. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It solely processes local data and outputs results, with no indication of malware or security threats.",
