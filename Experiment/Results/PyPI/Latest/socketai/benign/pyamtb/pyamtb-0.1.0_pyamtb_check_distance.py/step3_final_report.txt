  "purpose": "Calculate all interatomic distances between specified elements in a crystal structure from a POSCAR file, considering periodic boundary conditions.",
  "sources": "Reading POSCAR file via read_poscar, accessing atom symbols and coordinates from the data structure.",
  "sinks": "Outputting sorted distance data, printing distance statistics and detailed atom pair information.",
  "flows": "Input file data -> distance calculations considering periodic images -> sorted distance list -> printed summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. External read_poscar assumed standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard atomic distance calculations based on structure data, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. It filters atoms by element, computes all pairwise distances considering periodic images, sorts, and summarizes the data. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The reliance on an external read_poscar function is typical and does not introduce risks. The code is transparent and straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific utility for structural analysis, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting minimal inherent risk due to data handling. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
