{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pyamtb' Python package.",
  "sources": "File reading from 'README.md', package metadata definitions, dependencies, and entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or inputs; the setup script primarily defines package info and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from input to output; the code only reads a file and defines package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The package data and entry points are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to include in package metadata, then calls 'setup()' with predefined parameters including package info, dependencies, and console scripts. All actions are standard for Python package setup. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity is evident. The dependencies are well-known packages, and the entry point 'pyamtb=pyamtb.cli:main' points to a likely CLI entry in the package's code. No anomalies or malicious code are detected in this configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script for packaging a scientific library with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and standard.",
