  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for pyamtb, defining metadata, dependencies, package data, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static configuration data for package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as input; static configuration data used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with standard practices. It reads a README file, specifies package info, dependencies, optional extras, package data, and CLI entry points. There are no dynamic or untrusted data flows, no code injection, network activity, or obfuscation. All dependencies are common scientific packages. The script is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
