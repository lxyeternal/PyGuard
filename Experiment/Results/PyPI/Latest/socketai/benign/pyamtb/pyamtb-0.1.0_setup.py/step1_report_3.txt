{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyamtb', including dependencies, package data, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package data files; entry point command 'pyamtb=pyamtb.cli:main'.",
  "sinks": "The entry point 'pyamtb' which executes 'pyamtb.cli:main' function; dependencies listed for installation.",
  "flows": "The long description from README.md is read into setup; the 'pyamtb' CLI command invokes the 'main' function in 'pyamtb.cli'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. Use of standard packaging practices with no suspicious code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, specifies metadata, dependencies, package data, and CLI entry point. No code execution, network communication, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are common scientific libraries, and the entry point points to a CLI module, which is typical for CLI tools. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python packaging script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
