{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'pyamtb' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. No execution of external code or command injection points.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script primarily defines static configuration data and package setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a README file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, optional extras, package data, and console entry points. No user input, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted data is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dependencies are typical for scientific Python packages, and the entry point suggests a CLI interface, which appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or suspicious features. It does not contain malware or security risks based on this static analysis.",
