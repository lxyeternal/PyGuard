  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The analysis states that the setup script is standard, reading a README.md, defining package info, dependencies, and entry points. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (possibly slightly high, but since no issues are detected, should be 0).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup, no suspicious code or data flows.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Also a standard setup script, with no anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The CLI entry point and dependencies are typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup, no dynamic code, no external communication, no obfuscation, but assigns a securityRisk of 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems somewhat arbitrary; the code doesn't perform any risky operations. Unless there's an unmentioned concern, this should be 0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code; thus, **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (static setup script with no dynamic or risky operations), **0** is appropriate for all.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only minor discrepancy is the **securityRisk** score in Report 4 (0.1). Since the code is entirely static and standard, I would set this to **0** for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis reflects the static, benign nature of the setup script, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
