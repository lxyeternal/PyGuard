{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyamtb' for scientific calculations and model implementations.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; reads package data files (*.toml); specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing; no execution of external commands or dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Reads from files to gather description; specifies dependencies and entry points for console scripts; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected; standard setup.py structure. No indication of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated content.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. All data sources are static files or predefined strings. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network operations, no hidden behaviors. The dependencies are common scientific libraries, and the console script points to a local module. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup.py script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies detected. It adheres to standard practices for package distribution.",
