{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'pyamtb' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'README.md'; static configuration data for package setup; package requirements; entry point definition",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources are used in a way that leads to untrusted code execution or data leaks; no external network or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration; no dynamic data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior; code adheres to standard setup.py conventions",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup process, reading a README file for the long description and defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of code injection, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are common packages used in scientific computing and development, and there is no dynamic execution or data handling that could be malicious. The entry point points to a CLI module within the package, typical for command-line tools. Overall, the code appears secure and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is standard for Python package distribution, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
