  "purpose": "A command-line interface for performing tight-binding model calculations and distance measurements between atoms in a material structure.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, configuration files, POSCAR files for atomic structures",
  "sinks": "Output files with calculation results, standard output messages",
  "flows": "Input arguments determine configuration and files read; external modules perform calculations; results are saved or printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard for scientific utilities",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CLI with two main commands: 'calculate' for tight-binding calculations and 'distance' for atomic distance measurements. It loads parameters from files or defaults, reads POSCAR files, and calls external modules for computations. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is typical for scientific scripts, with argument parsing, file handling, and function calls. External modules are assumed safe; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate scientific CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the standard file handling and external module reliance. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
