  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Parameters class, including initialization and loading from a TOML file",
  "sources": "Input source is the temporary TOML file created during testing",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; test assertions are internal checks",
  "flows": "Data flows from the temporary TOML file into Parameters.from_toml() method, then into internal attributes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing of a class. It creates temporary files, writes configuration data, and loads it via a class method. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or malicious activities. Use of trusted libraries like pytest, numpy, and tomlkit are typical for testing. No signs of backdoors, malicious data handling, or secret exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit test code with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
