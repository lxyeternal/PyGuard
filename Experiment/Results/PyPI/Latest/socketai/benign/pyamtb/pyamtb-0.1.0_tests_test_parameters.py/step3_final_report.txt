{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the Parameters class, verifying initialization and loading from a TOML file.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a temporary TOML file created during the test.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the creation of the temporary TOML file (source) to the Parameters.from_toml() method (sink), then to assertions verifying loaded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed; the code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that creates a temporary configuration file, loads parameters, and asserts correctness. It employs standard libraries and does not perform any network activity, code injection, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and accurately reflect its safe, standard behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
