The reliance on an external function is noted but does not indicate malicious intent within this snippet. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to external dependency concerns."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the standard file handling and external module reliance. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The debug print statements are harmless but could be removed in production. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.1–0.2 reflects minimal concern primarily due to debug output, which is acceptable. Overall, the code is low-risk and suitable for supply chain use in scientific applications."
