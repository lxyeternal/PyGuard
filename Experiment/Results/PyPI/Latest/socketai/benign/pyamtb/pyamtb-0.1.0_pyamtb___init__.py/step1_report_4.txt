{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python package interface for tight-binding model calculations related to materials science.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from local modules: parameters, read_datas, tight_binding_model, check_distance.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward module imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package with version info and imports specific functions and classes from local modules, then exposes them via __all__. No data input, external network communication, or malicious logic is present. The structure suggests a typical package setup without signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. There are no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code appears purely structural, serving as an API interface for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard package __init__ file establishing module exports. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe based on the provided content.",
