  "purpose": "Package initializer for a Python scientific package, importing modules and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: parameters, read_datas, tight_binding_model, check_distance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import and export definitions.",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) lead to module initialization; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports internal modules and exposes functions/classes via __all__. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The imported modules could contain malicious code if compromised, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The high confidence (1) reflects the straightforward nature of the code and the absence of any malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is. Overall, the package initialization code is safe and standard for a scientific Python package.",
