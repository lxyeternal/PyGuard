  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pyamtb package's TightBindingModel class and its methods.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest, numpy, and modules from pyamtb; no external input sources; uses hardcoded parameters for tests.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no output to network, files, or system calls; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Test functions instantiate models with parameters, call methods, and perform assertions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected; straightforward test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests verifying model initialization, matrix shape, and energy band calculation. It uses static, hardcoded parameters and numpy arrays, with no dynamic code execution, no system calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. All functions serve typical testing purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a scientific Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
