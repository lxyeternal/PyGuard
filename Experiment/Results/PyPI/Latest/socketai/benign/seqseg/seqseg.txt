The only operational risk involves the unconditional deletion of files in the output directory, which should be used cautiously. Overall, the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

It performs standard file I/O, processing, and visualization tasks typical in medical image analysis. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the slight security risk score accounts for stdout redirection practices but is not indicative of malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as eval/exec and environment variable usage, indicating a moderate likelihood of malicious behavior. While no confirmed payloads are present, the obfuscation and dynamic execution elevate the security risk. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.3, and a security risk of 0.5."

The minimal operational security concern is the hardcoded file paths, which are not malicious but could be improved for flexibility. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
