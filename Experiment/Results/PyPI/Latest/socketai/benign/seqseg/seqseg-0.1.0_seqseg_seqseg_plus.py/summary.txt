  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured medical imaging pipeline with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard file I/O, processing, and visualization tasks typical in medical image analysis. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the slight security risk score accounts for stdout redirection practices but is not indicative of malicious behavior."
