{
  "purpose": "This code orchestrates a complex medical image processing pipeline, including configuration loading, directory management, segmentation, centerline tracing, surface analysis, and result saving. It does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from specified directories, loads configuration files via resources.files(), and processes images using imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed images, surfaces, centerlines, and logs to the filesystem; no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input directories and configuration files through processing functions, culminating in writing results and logs to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling during directory creation and redirects stdout to a file for logging, which could hide errors but are standard practices and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a controller for a medical imaging pipeline, with no signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. Directory creation is wrapped in broad exception handling, and stdout redirection is used for logging, both common in such workflows. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on standard libraries and modular functions, indicating legitimate use. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (0.1-0.2) reflects operational concerns but not security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured medical image processing pipeline with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
