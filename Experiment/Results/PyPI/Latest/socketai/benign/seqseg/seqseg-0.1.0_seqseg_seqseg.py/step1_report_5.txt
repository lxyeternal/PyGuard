{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a data processing pipeline for medical image segmentation and centerline extraction, involving reading input data, performing image processing and analysis, and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from specified directories and files, loads YAML configuration files, and processes command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes output images, VTK files, and logs to designated output directories; saves segmentation results, surface meshes, and centerlines.",
  "flows": "Input data is loaded from files; processed through various image processing and analysis functions; results are written to output files (images, VTK files, logs).",
  "anomalies": "Use of `resources.files()` to access configuration files, which is standard. Directory creation with exception handling is normal. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment and loads configurations, then processes multiple testing samples by executing image segmentation, centerline tracing, and surface analysis. It writes many intermediate and final results to specified output directories. No signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard libraries and modular functions presumed to be secure. Usage of `faulthandler` and exception handling improves stability but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate medical image processing pipeline with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data processing, analysis, and output generation safely. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
