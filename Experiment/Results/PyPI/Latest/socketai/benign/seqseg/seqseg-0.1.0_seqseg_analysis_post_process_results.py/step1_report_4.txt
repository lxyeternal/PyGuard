{
  "purpose": "The code processes medical image predictions by converting probability maps to binary images, retains the largest labeled regions, and writes the results to disk, along with surface evaluations and exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads image files from a specified directory using sitk.ReadImage; it also reads directory contents with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "The code writes processed images to disk with sitk.WriteImage; it exports surface data using vf.write_geo.",
  "flows": "Input images are read from disk (sources), processed with post_process (which involves potential data transformation), then written back to disk (sinks). Surface evaluation and export occur after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present. The code performs straightforward file I/O and processing.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard file I/O operations for medical imaging processing. It conditionally converts probability maps to binary images, keeps the largest connected components, and saves the results. It also evaluates the surface using a function from an imported module and exports the surface data. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries (os, SimpleITK) and straightforward processing steps suggest normal operation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard medical image post-processing script with no malicious behavior. It performs expected image processing tasks and file operations without any suspicious activity or malware indicators.",
