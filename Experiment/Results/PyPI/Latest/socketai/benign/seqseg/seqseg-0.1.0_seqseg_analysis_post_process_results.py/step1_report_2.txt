{
  "purpose": "The code processes medical image segmentation predictions by converting probability maps to binary images, retaining the largest connected components, and saving the results. It also evaluates and saves surface geometries.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from a specified folder using sitk.ReadImage; obtains list of prediction case files from directory listing.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed images to disk with sitk.WriteImage; writes surface geometries with vf.write_geo.",
  "flows": "Input images are read from disk, processed in post_process() (which calls from_prob_to_binary and keep_largest_label), then written back to disk; surface evaluation and writing are performed after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity; the code performs straightforward file processing and surface evaluation. There are no embedded or hidden backdoors, nor suspicious behavior like data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The script imports trusted libraries (SimpleITK and a custom vtk_functions module). It reads images, processes them with functions that seem standard for medical image analysis, and writes results. The only notable point is that the folder path is hardcoded, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, no code injection, no network activity, and no backdoors are evident. The code appears to perform legitimate processing steps without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard medical image post-processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes prediction images and outputs surface geometries, all within expected parameters.",
