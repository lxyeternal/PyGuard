  "purpose": "Medical image post-processing pipeline: converts probability maps to binary, retains largest labels, evaluates surface, and saves results.",
  "sources": "Input images read from specified folder using sitk.ReadImage.",
  "sinks": "Processed images written to output folder via sitk.WriteImage; surface geometries saved with vf.write_geo.",
  "flows": "Image read -> post_process (thresholding/labeling) -> write image -> evaluate surface -> save surface geometry.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded paths are present but not malicious, no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard medical image post-processing without network activity, obfuscation, or malicious functions. External libraries are trusted; no suspicious behaviors are evident. The hardcoded folder path is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The functions used appear legitimate and typical for such workflows. The overall structure is straightforward, and the code is readable and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard medical image post-processing script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the straightforward operations and minimal risk factors.",
