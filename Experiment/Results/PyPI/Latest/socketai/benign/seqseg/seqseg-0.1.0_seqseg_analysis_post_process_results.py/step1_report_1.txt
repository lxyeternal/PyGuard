{
  "purpose": "The code processes medical imaging predictions, applies post-processing to segmentations, and saves the results for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from the specified directory using sitk.ReadImage; processes images via from_prob_to_binary; retrieves list of files with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "Writes processed images back to disk with sitk.WriteImage; writes visualization files with vf.write_geo.",
  "flows": "Input images are read from disk, processed in post_process, then written back; processed images are used for surface evaluation and visualization output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are observed. The code uses standard libraries and functions for medical image processing.",
  "analysis": "The script loads medical images, applies threshold-based segmentation, keeps the largest labels, and saves outputs. It includes standard directory checks and file handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious network activity detected. Functions like from_prob_to_binary and keep_largest_label are assumed to be legitimate image processing functions. No hardcoded secrets or credential leaks are present. External library usage is appropriate for the task. The code's purpose aligns with standard medical image post-processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate post-processing of medical image segmentation results without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic. No malicious behavior detected.",
