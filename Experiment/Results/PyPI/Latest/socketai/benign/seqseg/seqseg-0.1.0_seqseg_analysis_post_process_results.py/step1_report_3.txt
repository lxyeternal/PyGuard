{
  "purpose": "The code reads medical image files, processes them to keep the largest labeled regions, and writes the processed images back to disk, along with surface evaluations for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads image files using sitk.ReadImage, lists directory contents with os.listdir, reads environment variables (implied in file paths), and inputs from external modules (vtk_functions and compute_metrics).",
  "sinks": "Writes processed images with sitk.WriteImage, writes geometry files with vf.write_geo, and creates directories.",
  "flows": "Input files are read from disk; image data is processed in memory; results are written back to disk. No untrusted data flows directly into command execution or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or unauthorized network communication is present. External modules are used for image processing, which is typical in medical image workflows.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles file input/output operations for medical images, applying segmentation post-processing techniques, and generating visualization files. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident. The use of external libraries like sitk and vtk_functions appears legitimate for medical imaging purposes. The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard medical image processing pipeline with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It reads, processes, and outputs image data, and generates visualization files. There is low likelihood of malicious intent or supply chain attack embedded within this module.",
