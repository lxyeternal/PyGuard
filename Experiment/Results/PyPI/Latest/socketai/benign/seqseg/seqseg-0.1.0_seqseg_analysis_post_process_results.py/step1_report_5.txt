{
  "purpose": "The code performs post-processing on medical image segmentation predictions, including thresholding, label extraction, and surface evaluation, then saves the results.",
  "sources": "File system (os.listdir, sitk.ReadImage), external libraries (sitk, vtk_functions), and potentially user data inputs from the file system.",
  "sinks": "Writing images to disk (sitk.WriteImage), writing geometry files (.vtp) with vf.write_geo, and creating directories.",
  "flows": "Input images read from disk -> processed in memory -> output images and geometry files written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or system modifications. The code uses standard libraries and functions without unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script reads medical images from a specific folder, processes them with segmentation thresholding and label extraction functions, and writes the processed images and surface geometries back to disk. No code injects or executes untrusted code; no network activity or data exfiltration observed. The usage of external libraries appears legitimate for medical image processing. The directory creation and file handling are straightforward. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate medical image post-processing script with no detectable malicious intent or malicious code. It performs standard operations for medical image analysis and visualization. No security threats or malware behaviors are identified.",
