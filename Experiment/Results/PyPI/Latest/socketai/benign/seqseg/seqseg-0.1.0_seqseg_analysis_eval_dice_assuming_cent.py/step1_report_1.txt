{
  "purpose": "This script performs 3D medical image segmentation and analysis using a deep learning model, including data loading, prediction, evaluation, and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads image and segmentation files from specified directories, loads a neural network model and weights, and reads CSV metadata files.",
  "sinks": "Writes prediction images, segmentation masks, and surface models to output directories; loads model weights; reads input images and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input images and segmentation files flow into prediction components; model weights are loaded; predictions are processed and saved; evaluation metrics are computed and saved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to use standard libraries and straightforward logic. No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Commented code exists but is not malicious. No hidden network connections or system disruptions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical image processing and deep learning inference tasks with standard libraries such as SimpleITK, numpy, pandas, and custom modules. It loads data, applies a U-Net model for segmentation, saves output images and surface models, and evaluates segmentation quality. The code includes directory creation, data listing, and prediction routines, all of which are typical for such workflows. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system sabotage, are present. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscated or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard medical imaging pipeline for segmentation and analysis, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate application for medical image processing.",
