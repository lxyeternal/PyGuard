{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive medical image segmentation pipeline involving data loading, model inference, segmentation, and evaluation, primarily for brain or vascular imaging.",
  "sources": "Reads image files (.nii.gz), segmentation masks, CSV metadata, and model weights; loads images, CSV data, and model parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes segmentation masks, prediction images, surface models, and evaluation metrics; saves outputs to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Loads images and metadata from disk, processes through a neural network model, generates predictions, adds segmentations, and saves results; includes optional evaluation and surface analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Commented code and debug statements are typical during development. Use of pickle is standard for serialization of known variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard medical imaging pipeline with data I/O, model inference, segmentation, and evaluation steps. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation techniques are used. The code structure is clear, with straightforward library usage and typical debugging comments. The presence of commented-out code and pdb traces indicates development-stage code, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard medical image processing pipeline with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
