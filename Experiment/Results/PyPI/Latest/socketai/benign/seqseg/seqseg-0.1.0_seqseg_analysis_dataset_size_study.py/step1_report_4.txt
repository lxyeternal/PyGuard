{
  "purpose": "The code generates a scatter plot visualizing Dice scores versus dataset percentages for different benchmark data series.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded data lists (`percentages`, `benchmark`, `seqseg`) and imports the `matplotlib.pyplot` library.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a visualization using `plt.show()`, which displays the generated plot.",
  "flows": "Data is read from hardcoded lists and passed to plotting functions, resulting in a visual output. No untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward visualization logic with no external data processing or hidden code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing `matplotlib.pyplot`. It defines dataset percentages and two data series (`benchmark` and `seqseg`). Multiple dataset options are commented out, indicating potential configuration variations. The code creates a scatter plot with connecting lines, labels axes, adds grid lines, and displays the plot. All data are hardcoded, and there are no signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or secret behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization script that does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely generates a plot from static data. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
