{
  "purpose": "The code generates a scatter plot visualizing Dice scores against dataset percentages for two datasets, 'benchmark' and 'seqseg'.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'percentages' and 'benchmark', 'seqseg' lists defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib functions that generate the plot and display it; no external data or untrusted input sources involved.",
  "flows": "Data is used directly to create the plot with no external data flow or user input; visualization is static based on hardcoded lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports matplotlib for plotting, defines static datasets for percentages and scores, and generates a scatter plot with connecting lines and labels. All data is hardcoded and there are no input or output channels that could be exploited. The code appears to be a standard data visualization script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data visualization script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It only displays static, hardcoded data in a plot. No malicious or suspicious code is present.",
