  "purpose": "The code generates a scatter plot comparing benchmark and sequence segmentation Dice scores across different dataset percentages for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Static lists of dataset percentages, benchmark scores, and sequence segmentation scores defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read untrusted input or data from external sources, nor does it write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Static data lists serve as sources; matplotlib plotting functions display the data without external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with commented-out alternative datasets but no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard plotting library, defines static data, and creates a plot with connecting lines, labels, grid, and legend. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. All data and plotting are static and benign. The commented sections are harmless and indicate alternative datasets for visualization. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected, and the code's purpose is purely illustrative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data visualization script with no malicious, suspicious, or security-risk elements. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
