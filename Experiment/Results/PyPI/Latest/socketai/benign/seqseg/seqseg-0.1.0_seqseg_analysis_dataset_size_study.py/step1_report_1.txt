{
  "purpose": "The code generates a scatter plot visualizing Dice scores versus percentage of dataset, comparing 'Benchmark' and 'Seqseg' datasets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded lists: 'percentages', 'benchmark', and 'seqseg'. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'plt.show()' to display the plot; no data is written to files or sent over the network. No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the data used is hardcoded, and visualization is local.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscation detected. All code appears standard for data visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'matplotlib.pyplot' for plotting, defines static data arrays, and creates a scatter plot with connecting lines, labels, and grid. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. It performs a straightforward data visualization task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data visualization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses hardcoded data for plotting purposes only.",
