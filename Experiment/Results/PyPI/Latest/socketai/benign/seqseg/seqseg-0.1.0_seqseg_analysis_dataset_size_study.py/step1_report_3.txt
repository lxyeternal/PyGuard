{
  "purpose": "The code generates a scatter plot visualizing Dice scores versus dataset percentage, comparing benchmark and sequence segmentation results.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded lists for 'percentages', 'benchmark', and 'seqseg'. It also imports 'matplotlib.pyplot' for plotting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks that handle untrusted input data or perform data leaks. It only visualizes static data.",
  "flows": "N/A, since all data is hardcoded and there are no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out sections for alternative data configurations, but no suspicious or malicious logic is present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or data leakage mechanisms are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard plotting library, defines static datasets for plotting, and visualizes these datasets with labels, lines, and formatting. There are no inputs from external sources, no handling of untrusted data, and no network or file system operations. The code appears to be straightforward and solely for data visualization purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data visualization script with static data. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident. It serves a purely illustrative function without any suspicious activity.",
