{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read external input or data streams explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flow paths are present, as the code mainly consists of function definitions and variable assignments without data ingestion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code does not perform obfuscated operations or dynamic code execution. No unusual patterns or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of standard Python functions and control structures. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious data handling, or malicious network activity. The absence of input/output operations, network calls, or environment variable manipulations suggests no malicious behavior. The code structure appears normal, with clear and standard programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. Confidence is high that this code is safe.",
