  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as eval/exec and environment variable usage, indicating a moderate likelihood of malicious behavior. While no confirmed payloads are present, the obfuscation and dynamic execution elevate the security risk. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.3, and a security risk of 0.5."
