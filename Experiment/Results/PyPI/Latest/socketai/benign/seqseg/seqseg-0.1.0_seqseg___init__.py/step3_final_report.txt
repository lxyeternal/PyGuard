  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious constructs, and potential data leaks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), module imports, input/output functions, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, environment variable access, code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and dynamic eval/exec flow into code execution or data exfiltration sinks, indicating possible malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, environment variable handling, obfuscation hints, dynamic code generation, suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Environment variables are used, potentially for covert data handling. The presence of eval/exec indicates possible code injection or obfuscation. No explicit payloads or network connections are confirmed, but the patterns suggest potential malicious intent. The scores reflect suspicion but lack definitive payload evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as eval/exec and environment variable usage, indicating a moderate likelihood of malicious behavior. While no confirmed payloads are present, the obfuscation and dynamic execution elevate the security risk. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling, with a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation at 0.3, and a security risk of 0.5.",
