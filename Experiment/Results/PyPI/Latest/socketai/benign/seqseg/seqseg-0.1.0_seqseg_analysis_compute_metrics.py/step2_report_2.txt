  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Summary**: The report states the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 (minimal, due to general code complexity)\n   - **Comments**: The code performs typical image processing, metric calculations, and plotting. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The functions are straightforward and legitimate.\n   - **Conclusion**: No security concerns; the code is safe.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate processing with standard libraries, no malicious activity.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1\n   - **Comments**: No suspicious code, no external network calls, no hidden logic. The code is a typical medical image analysis pipeline.\n   - **Conclusion**: No malicious intent detected.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Summary**: Again, standard processing, no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1\n   - **Comments**: No external communication, no code obfuscation, no backdoors. Focused on image analysis and visualization.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe and legitimate.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Summary**: The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1\n   - **Comments**: No network activity, no malicious logic, functions perform standard image processing tasks.\n   - **Conclusion**: No security concerns.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Summary**: Consistent with previous reports—legitimate, standard image processing code.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1\n   - **Comments**: No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports indicate zero, and the code is standard for medical image analysis. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Zero, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score**: Consistently low at 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and align with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n- The detailed review confirms the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### My estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the thorough review.",
