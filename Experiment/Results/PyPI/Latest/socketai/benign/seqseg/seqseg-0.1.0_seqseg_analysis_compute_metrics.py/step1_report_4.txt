  "purpose": "The script performs a comprehensive analysis of medical imaging segmentation results, including metrics calculation, visualization, and combining segmentation outputs across different methods and datasets.",
  "sources": "Data is read from image files (e.g., .vtk, .mha, .nii.gz, .nrrd) from specified folders; user inputs or file paths are used for reading images, masks, and case names; environment variables are not directly used for data input.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots and text files are saved to output directories; images are written back using sitk.WriteImage; no untrusted data is written to external systems or network; no data exfiltration code is present.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and processed (source); metrics and visualizations are generated and saved (sink); no data flows directly to external systems or untrusted sinks that could cause leakage or harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets detected. The code involves standard image processing and plotting routines. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No network connections, system modifications, or external data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly handles medical image processing, statistical analysis, and visualization. It reads image data from known formats, calculates metrics like Dice and Hausdorff distances, performs statistical tests, and saves plots and summaries. No suspicious file operations, network activity, or privilege escalations are present. The functions are well-structured for data analysis; no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code includes some generic error handling and print statements, but nothing indicating malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears legitimate, focused on research and evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard medical image analysis pipeline with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It reads data, performs analysis, visualizes results, and saves outputs securely. No malicious activities such as data theft, backdoors, or network communication are detected.",
