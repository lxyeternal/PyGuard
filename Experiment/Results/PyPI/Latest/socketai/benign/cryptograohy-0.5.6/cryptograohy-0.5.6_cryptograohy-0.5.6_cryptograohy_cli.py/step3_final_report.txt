  "purpose": "ASCII art generator that converts input text into stylized ASCII representations using a predefined font dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input string to the generate_ascii_art function, which is converted to uppercase; the ascii_font dictionary providing ASCII patterns for characters.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs the generated ASCII art as a string joined by newline characters; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> convert to uppercase -> iterate over each character -> append corresponding ASCII patterns line-by-line -> join lines into final ASCII art output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; static font dictionary, straightforward string processing, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static ASCII font dictionary for uppercase letters and space. The generate_ascii_art function converts input to uppercase, then constructs ASCII art line-by-line by concatenating character patterns with spacing. The greet() function calls generate_ascii_art with a static string and prints the result. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is simple, static, and designed solely for ASCII art generation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static ASCII art generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
