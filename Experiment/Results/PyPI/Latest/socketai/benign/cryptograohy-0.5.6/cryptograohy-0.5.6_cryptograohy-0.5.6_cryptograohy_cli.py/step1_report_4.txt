  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art representation of input text using predefined font patterns.",
  "sources": "The input to the function generate_ascii_art (the 'text' parameter).",
  "sinks": "The output of generate_ascii_art, which prints ASCII art to the console in greet().",
  "flows": "Input text is processed in generate_ascii_art, converted to uppercase, mapped to ASCII patterns, and printed via greet().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static ASCII font dictionary and a function to generate ASCII art from input text. It converts the input text to uppercase, maps each character to its ASCII representation, and concatenates the lines for visual output. The greet() function simply calls generate_ascii_art with a fixed string and prints the result. There are no external data sources, no sinks that handle untrusted data beyond display, and no code that interacts with the system or network in a suspicious manner. The code structure is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII art generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply maps predefined patterns to input characters and prints them. The function greet() outputs a static message. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
