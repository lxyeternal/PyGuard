{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII art representations of input text using a predefined font dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input data is the string passed to the generate_ascii_art() function, specifically the text argument.",
  "sinks": "Output is the ASCII art string generated; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into generate_ascii_art(), is processed to create ASCII art, and then returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a font dictionary for uppercase letters and space, then creates a function to generate ASCII art by concatenating the font representations for each character. The function processes input text by converting it to uppercase, then appends each character's ASCII art line-by-line, adding spaces between characters. The greet() function calls generate_ascii_art() with a static string and prints the result. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII art generator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely transforms input text into ASCII art format without external dependencies or harmful operations.",
