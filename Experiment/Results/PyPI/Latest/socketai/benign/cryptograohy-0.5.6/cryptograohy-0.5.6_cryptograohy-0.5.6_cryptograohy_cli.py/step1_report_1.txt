  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art representation of input text using predefined font patterns.",
  "sources": "Input string to the function generate_ascii_art, specifically the 'text' parameter being processed.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs ASCII art as a string via return statement; no data leakage or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is converted to uppercase, then each character's ASCII art lines are concatenated to build the final ASCII art output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs straightforward string processing and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary mapping characters to their ASCII art representations. The generate_ascii_art function processes input text, converting it to uppercase, then constructs a list of lines by appending the ASCII patterns of each character. The greet function prints the ASCII art for 'Greetings'. There are no external data sources, no network operations, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious code constructs. The logic is simple and benign, serving only as a text-to-ASCII art generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for ASCII art generation. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs straightforward string processing without external dependencies or data leaks.",
