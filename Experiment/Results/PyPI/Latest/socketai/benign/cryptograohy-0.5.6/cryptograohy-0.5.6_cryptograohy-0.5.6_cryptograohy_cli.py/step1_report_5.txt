{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII art representations of input text and prints a greeting message using this ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Input source is the hardcoded string \"Greetings\" in the greet() function; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or interact with sensitive data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply processes a static string to produce ASCII art and prints it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The ASCII font dictionary is static and predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static ASCII font dictionary mapping characters to ASCII art representations. The generate_ascii_art() function converts input text to uppercase, then constructs a multi-line ASCII art string by concatenating character patterns line by line. The greet() function prints the ASCII art for the static string \"Greetings\". There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, no code injection mechanisms, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign task of generating and printing ASCII art from a fixed string. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious activity detected.",
