  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art representations of input text using a predefined font dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input text in the function generate_ascii_art; the input string is processed internally.",
  "sinks": "Output string returned by generate_ascii_art; printed to the console in the greet function.",
  "flows": "Input text is converted to uppercase, processed character-by-character to assemble ASCII art lines, and then output as a joined string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network access, no data leaks, and no suspicious code logic. The code solely manipulates and displays static data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static dictionary ascii_font with ASCII representations for alphabet characters and space. The generate_ascii_art function converts input text to uppercase, then constructs an ASCII art by concatenating character representations line-by-line, adding spaces for readability. The greet function calls generate_ascii_art with a static string 'Greetings' and prints the result. There are no input sources from untrusted external inputs, no code injection, and no network activity. The code performs straightforward string and list operations using static data. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple ASCII art generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It processes static data and outputs formatted text. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or suspicious behavior.",
