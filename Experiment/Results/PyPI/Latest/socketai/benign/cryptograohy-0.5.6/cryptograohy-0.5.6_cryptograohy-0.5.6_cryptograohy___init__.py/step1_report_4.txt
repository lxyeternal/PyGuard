  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import simply loads a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization file that imports a single function from a local module. It contains no user input handling, external data access, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
