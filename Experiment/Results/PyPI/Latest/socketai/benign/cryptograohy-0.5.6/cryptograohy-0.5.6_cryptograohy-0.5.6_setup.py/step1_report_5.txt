{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation process for a Python package named 'cryptograohy', including a custom post-installation action that interacts with the 'pyprettifier' library.",
  "sources": "Reads include the package requirements ('install_requires'), package metadata (name, version, author, etc.), and the import of 'pyprettifier' within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The '_post_install_action' method writes to the file '/tmp/a', which is a local file operation, not an immediate security concern; no sinks involve network communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The custom install command executes 'fetch_build_eggs' and then performs a post-install action that imports 'pyprettifier' and writes a fixed string to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes a static string '---' to a temporary file during post-install, which appears benign; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The import of 'pyprettifier' and its instantiation do not seem suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation step. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' attempts to fetch build eggs and perform a post-install action involving importing 'pyprettifier' and writing to '/tmp/a'. The use of try-except captures exceptions gracefully. There are no network communications, credential handling, or malicious code snippets detected. The overall structure and code content are typical for a setup script, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a benign post-install action that writes a static string to a temporary file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The import of 'pyprettifier' appears to be a normal dependency for the package, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
