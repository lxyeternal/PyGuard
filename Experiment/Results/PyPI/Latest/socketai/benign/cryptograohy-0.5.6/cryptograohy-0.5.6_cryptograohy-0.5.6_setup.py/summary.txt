  "conclusion": "The code shows minor suspicious behaviors—writing to a temp file and importing an external library during setup—but no definitive malicious activity. The package name misspelling and import behavior warrant caution. Overall, the code appears benign but should be monitored, especially the 'pyprettifier' library. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0.2), no obfuscation (0), and moderate security risk (0.3)."
