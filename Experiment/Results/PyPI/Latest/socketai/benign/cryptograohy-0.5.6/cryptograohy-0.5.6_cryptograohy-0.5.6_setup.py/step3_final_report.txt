{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a Python package 'cryptograohy' with a custom installation step that imports 'pyprettifier', instantiates an EmojiConverter object, and writes '---' to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sources": "During installation, the code imports 'pyprettifier' and writes to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing static data ('---') to '/tmp/a' during install; importing 'pyprettifier' which could execute code.",
  "flows": "Import 'pyprettifier' during install -> instantiate EmojiConverter (potential side effects) -> write '---' to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Writing to '/tmp/a' during install, misspelled package name 'cryptograohy', import of 'pyprettifier' during setup, creation of an object without use.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with a custom install command. It performs dependency fetching, then executes a post-install action that imports 'pyprettifier' and writes to a temp file. The package name is misspelled, which could be an evasion tactic. The import of 'pyprettifier' during install could execute malicious code if the library is compromised. Writing static data to '/tmp/a' is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code is clear, with no obfuscation. The suspicious elements are the write operation and import during install, but no active malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows minor suspicious behaviors—writing to a temp file and importing an external library during setup—but no definitive malicious activity. The package name misspelling and import behavior warrant caution. Overall, the code appears benign but should be monitored, especially the 'pyprettifier' library. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0.2), no obfuscation (0), and moderate security risk (0.3).",
