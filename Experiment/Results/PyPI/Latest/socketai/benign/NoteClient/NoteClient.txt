No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the import pattern should be reviewed for safety. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3."

The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting potential misuse if credentials are compromised, but no evidence of sabotage or malicious activity is detected."
