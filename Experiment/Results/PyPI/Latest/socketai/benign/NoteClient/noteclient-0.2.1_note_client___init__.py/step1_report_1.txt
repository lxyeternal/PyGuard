  "purpose": "Import all contents from the note_client module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "The module imports all from .note_client.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the note_client module into this module's namespace; no direct flows are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can hide imported content, which might be suspicious if note_client contains malicious code, but it is a common pattern in package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves to expose the contents of note_client and set a version string. It does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The import * pattern may obscure what is imported, but this alone is not malicious. No external data sources, sinks, or complex flows are present. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for a package initializer.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization snippet with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple, with minimal complexity, and does not perform any harmful actions.",
