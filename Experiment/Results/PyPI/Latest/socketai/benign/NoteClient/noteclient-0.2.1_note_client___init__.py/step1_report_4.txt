  "purpose": "Import all contents from the note_client module and define the package version",
  "sources": "Import statement from .note_client",
  "sinks": "None present in the visible code",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs a module import from a relative module and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The import statement could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if note_client module is malicious, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity can be inferred. The version assignment is a standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, performing a straightforward import and version declaration without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
