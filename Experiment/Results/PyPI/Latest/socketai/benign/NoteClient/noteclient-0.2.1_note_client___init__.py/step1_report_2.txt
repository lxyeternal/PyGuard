{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports all components from a local note_client module and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .note_client import *, which loads all symbols from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing symbols from note_client; no external data flow or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can obscure which components are imported and may lead to unintended behaviors. The version string is hardcoded, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily importing all contents from a local module and setting a version. The wildcard import is considered bad practice but not malicious in itself. No evidence of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. No sensitive data or credentials are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with a potentially risky import style but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign.",
