  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can hide imported symbols and potentially include malicious code without explicit control; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named note_client, which could obscure which functions or variables are being imported. The version string is straightforward. Since only import and version declaration are present, there's no immediate indication of malicious behavior. However, wildcard imports can sometimes hide malicious code if note_client contains such. No other suspicious or anomalous code structures are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet by itself is benign but uses a wildcard import which can be risky if the imported module is malicious or contains hidden code. The overall security risk is low to moderate, depending on the contents of note_client.",
