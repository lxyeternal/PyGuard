  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported functions or variables and potentially introduce hidden or malicious code from the module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module note_client and sets a version string. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged because it can hide what is being imported, potentially including malicious or unintended code. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import and version declaration, with no direct signs of malicious behavior. However, the wildcard import could mask hidden malicious components within note_client, warranting review of that module separately.",
