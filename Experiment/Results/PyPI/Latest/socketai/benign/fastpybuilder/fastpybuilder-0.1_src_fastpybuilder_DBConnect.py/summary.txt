  "conclusion": "The code is a schema-driven backend generator with insecure credential practices but no malware or malicious intent. Security risks stem from credential exposure and subprocess usage, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.4, reflecting moderate concern mainly due to credential management."
