  "flows": "N/A (No data flow from source to sink)",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and uses them to configure the package. It specifies a package name, version, and author, with no additional code that reads untrusted data, executes dynamic code, or performs any network or file operations. The structure is typical for a setup script. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
