  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'fastpybuilder'.",
  "sources": "Reading package information (name, version, packages, author) from the setup function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present in the setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. No unusual or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. It performs a typical package configuration with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. There are no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for package configuration.",
