  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'fastpybuilder' Python project.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and 'find_packages()' call which specify package metadata and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules for packaging and calls 'setup' with basic metadata, including package name, version, author, and package discovery. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The code appears to be a conventional package setup script without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious components identified. It follows typical packaging conventions without any malicious behavior.",
