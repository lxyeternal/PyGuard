  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard setup script:\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"fastpybuilder\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    author=\"Lenin Ospina Lamprea\"\n)\n```\nIt imports `setuptools`, calls `setup()` with static, hardcoded metadata, and uses `find_packages()` to discover packages. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, input handling, or obfuscated segments.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script.\n- They note the absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- They assign a confidence of 1, and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n- The analysis is consistent across reports.\n\n**Logical assessment:**\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The code is purely declarative for package configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and conservative, which is justified given the code's simplicity.\n- No reason to adjust scores or challenge the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, conventional setup script with no malicious or suspicious components.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are correct; the code is safe and standard.",
