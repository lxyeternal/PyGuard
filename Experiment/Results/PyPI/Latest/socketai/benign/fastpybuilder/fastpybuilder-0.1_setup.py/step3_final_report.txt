{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging a Python project, specifying package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static import of 'setuptools' and the call to 'setup()' with hardcoded parameters; 'find_packages()' used to discover packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data or external inputs; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving sources and sinks; the code executes statically without dynamic data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with static imports and a call to 'setup()' using fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is correct.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
