  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious Flask controller generator with potential security risks arising from untrusted input variables influencing code generation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is ensuring input sanitization before use to prevent code injection. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a risk score around 0.2–0.3 depending on trust in inputs."
