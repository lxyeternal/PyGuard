  "purpose": "Dynamically generates Flask controller files and routes based on provided variables, facilitating REST API endpoint creation.",
  "sources": "Input variables dict for filenames and import names; request.get_json() for request payloads.",
  "sinks": "File write operations for controller files; dynamic import and route definitions; passing request data into service methods.",
  "flows": "Variables influence filename and import string generation; request.get_json() data flows into service method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Potential for code injection if 'variables' are untrusted, as filenames and import statements are constructed directly from input without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate utility for generating Flask controllers dynamically, with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. It relies on external input to determine filenames and module imports, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted. The use of request.get_json() passes unvalidated data into service methods, posing a risk if downstream services mishandle untrusted input. The code does not perform any network activity or contain hardcoded secrets. The overall structure is straightforward and clear, with no signs of obfuscation. The primary security concern is input validation; otherwise, the code is safe. The risk score should reflect the potential for code injection if inputs are malicious, but the current implementation does not contain malicious behavior itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious Flask controller generator with potential security risks arising from untrusted input variables influencing code generation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is ensuring input sanitization before use to prevent code injection. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a risk score around 0.2–0.3 depending on trust in inputs.",
