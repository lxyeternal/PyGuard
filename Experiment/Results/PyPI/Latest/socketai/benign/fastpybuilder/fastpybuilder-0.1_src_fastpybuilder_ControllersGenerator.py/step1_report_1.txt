  "purpose": "Generate Flask controller files dynamically based on provided variables, creating routes and importing services.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'variables' dictionary; filename and path info from inspect and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files, importing modules, defining Flask routes that execute service methods.",
  "flows": "Variables are used to generate import statements and route handlers; data flows from 'variables' into code generation, then into service method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network or file operations. The code performs standard dynamic file generation for Flask controllers.",
  "analysis": "The script inspects the caller's filename to set directory paths, then creates or appends to an __init__.py file and writes Flask route definitions into specific controller files based on input variables. It imports service modules dynamically based on variable names, and defines standard CRUD endpoints. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on external service modules and Flask, which are standard in web API development. No suspicious network activity, encryption, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate code generator for Flask controllers, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
