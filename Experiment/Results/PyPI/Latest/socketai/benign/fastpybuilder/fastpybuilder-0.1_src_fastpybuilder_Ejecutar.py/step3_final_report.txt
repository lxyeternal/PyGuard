  "purpose": "Detects the operating system and executes predefined setup or runtime scripts accordingly.",
  "sources": "The platform.system() call to determine OS; subprocess.run() calls to execute external scripts (.bat or .sh files).",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess.run(), potentially leading to code execution if scripts are malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines OS -> conditional branch -> subprocess.run() executes script based on OS.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True on Windows subprocess call; external scripts' content unknown; no input validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly detects the OS and runs associated scripts, with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from external scripts and the use of shell=True, which could be exploited if scripts are compromised. The code itself is benign, and no suspicious behavior is evident. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by reliance on external scripts and subprocess invocation method.",
  "conclusion": "The Python code is simple, purpose-driven, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The main security concern is external script trustworthiness, not the code itself. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
