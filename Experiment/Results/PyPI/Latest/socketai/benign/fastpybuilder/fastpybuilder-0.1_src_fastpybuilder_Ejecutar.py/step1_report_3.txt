  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs environment setup scripts based on the operating system, specifically for Windows or Linux.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, subprocess.run() to execute batch or shell scripts.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executes external scripts which could potentially be malicious if the scripts are compromised.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → subprocess.run() with script files based on OS",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run() with shell=True on Windows, which can be risky if inputs are manipulated, but scripts are static filenames; no dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the OS type and executes corresponding setup or run scripts. These scripts (windows-setup.bat, linux-setup.sh, etc.) are external and their content is not shown, which poses some risk if these scripts are malicious. However, the Python code itself is straightforward and only calls predefined scripts based on OS detection. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present. Use of shell=True on Windows could be a concern if script paths are dynamic or user-controlled, but here they are static. Overall, the Python code itself does not contain malicious behavior but relies on external scripts, which could be a vector if scripts are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The Python code functions as a launcher for setup and execution scripts based on OS. It does not exhibit malicious behavior directly. The main risk lies in the content and integrity of the external scripts being executed, which cannot be assessed from this code alone.",
