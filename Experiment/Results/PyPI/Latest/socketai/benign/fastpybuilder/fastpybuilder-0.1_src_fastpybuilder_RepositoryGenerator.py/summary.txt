  "conclusion": "The code is a boilerplate generator that does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. Its main security issue is embedding unvalidated user credentials directly into generated files, which could lead to credential leakage if files are mishandled or exposed. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and moderate risk scores reflecting credential handling concerns."
