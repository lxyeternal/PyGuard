  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to execution and database connection",
  "sources": "Import statements do not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; only module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three functions/classes from internal modules: 'inicioEjecucion', 'inicioVenv', and 'DBConnect'. There are no function calls, data processing, or external data handling. The imports are straightforward and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are visible. This code appears to be part of a larger project setup or initialization script, with no apparent security issues or malware signs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of module import statements with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is standard in nature and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
