{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from local modules, likely for executing processes and database connection.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules './Ejecutar' and './DBConnect'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from the provided code snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions 'inicioEjecucion' and 'inicioVenv' from a module named 'Ejecutar', and 'DBConnect' from 'DBConnect'. There is no implementation or execution logic, no suspicious or malicious code, nor any obfuscated code present. The imports suggest setup or initialization procedures but do not indicate malicious intent. Given the limited snippet, there are no signs of security risks or malware. The code appears typical for modular Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard structure for organizing functions in Python projects.",
