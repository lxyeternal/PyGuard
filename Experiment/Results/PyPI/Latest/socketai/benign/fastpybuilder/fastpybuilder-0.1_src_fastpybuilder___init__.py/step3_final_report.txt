{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes from local modules, likely for initializing or configuring parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.Ejecutar and .DBConnect).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond imports; no runtime data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no execution, data processing, or network activity. The imported functions and classes are typical for modular Python applications. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk≈0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The minimal security risk score slightly above zero may reflect cautious default, but given only import statements, zero risk is justified. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate; a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 accurately reflect the code's nature. The overall security risk is negligible. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
