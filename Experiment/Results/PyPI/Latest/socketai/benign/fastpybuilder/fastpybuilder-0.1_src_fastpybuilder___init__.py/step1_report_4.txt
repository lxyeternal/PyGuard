  "purpose": "Importing functions and classes from local modules 'Ejecutar' and 'DBConnect' for use within the project.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. Imports appear standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing functions 'inicioEjecucion' and 'inicioVenv' from 'Ejecutar', and the class 'DBConnect' from its module. All imports are from local modules, with no external data handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code features. The code appears to be part of a larger application, setting up dependencies for execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malware, or security issues. The overall risk is negligible.",
