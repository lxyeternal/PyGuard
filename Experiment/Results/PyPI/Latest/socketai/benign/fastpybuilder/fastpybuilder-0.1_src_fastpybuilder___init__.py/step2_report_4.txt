  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .Ejecutar import inicioEjecucion\nfrom .Ejecutar import inicioVenv\nfrom .DBConnect import DBConnect\n```\n\n---\n\n### **1. Content and Presence of Issues**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports describe only import statements from local modules, with no execution, data processing, or suspicious patterns.  \n  **Conclusion:** The code is benign; no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Logical accuracy:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements with no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n  **No errors or flaws** are evident in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Score Justifications and Reasonableness**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Security Risk | Comments |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0.1            | Slight security risk assigned; perhaps overly cautious given only import statements. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0.1            | Same as above; minimal risk justified. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0              | Correctly low risk. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0              | Correct. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0              | Correct. |\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All scores align with the benign nature of the code snippet. The slight security risk score (~0.1) in some reports may reflect an overly cautious stance, but given only import statements, it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5.  \n- **Justification:** The code is only importing functions/classes; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **No signs of malicious code or backdoors** are present in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code only contains import statements with no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.  \n- The minimal security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Overall Expert Estimate**\n\n**Considering all the above:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward set of import statements, typical in Python projects, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | **0**             | No malicious activity or code detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated Score| **0**             | Code is clear, straightforward imports.                      |\n| Security Risk   | **0**             | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior observed.             |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
