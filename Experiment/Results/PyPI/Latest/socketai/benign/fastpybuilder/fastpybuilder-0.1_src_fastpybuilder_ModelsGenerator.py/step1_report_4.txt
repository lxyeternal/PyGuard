{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically generates SQLAlchemy model classes based on input variables, creating Python files for database models.",
  "sources": "Input variables dict; inspect.stack() for caller frame info; environment variables (indirectly via os.path); file system via os.makedirs and open.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (open/write) which create or append Python files with generated code.",
  "flows": "Variables dict → file content generation; caller info → file paths; data from variables → code strings written to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() to determine caller file path; dynamic code generation writing multiple files based on input data; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no user input processed; no network activity; no obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses inspect to determine the caller's filename, constructs file paths, and creates Python modules with model classes based on provided variables. It writes class definitions and attributes into separate files, referencing a predefined dictionary for SQL type mappings. The code performs file operations (creating directories and writing files) based on the input variables, which appear to be schemas or model definitions. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The dynamic file generation is predictable and based on input data, with no use of untrusted input sources like user input or environment variables that could be exploited. The code's primary purpose is code generation, not data handling or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate code generator for SQLAlchemy models, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not process or transmit sensitive data, nor does it include hidden or suspicious operations. The code structure and functions are consistent with standard code generation tasks.",
