{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically generates SQLAlchemy ORM model classes and their fields based on provided variable definitions, writing these classes into Python files for later use.",
  "sources": "Variables parameter passed to generate() method, which contains schema information; inspect.stack() to determine caller file; environment variables are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for creating Python modules and classes; potentially writes code that could be executed or imported later.",
  "flows": "Input variables -> code constructs class definitions -> writes class code to files on disk",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of inspect.stack() for filename access is typical; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; file writes are straightforward; no user input or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports inspect and os modules, uses inspect to determine the caller file location, and then constructs paths for saving generated models. It writes class definitions based on input variables, mapping database types to SQLAlchemy types, and generates model files accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The file operations are limited to creating and appending model class code based on known inputs. No user input, network calls, or environment variable misuse are present. The code appears to serve a code generation purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate code generator for ORM models with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. It performs file writes based on provided schema data and uses standard libraries in a typical manner. No security risks or malware behavior are detected.",
