  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, low-risk utility for generating SQLAlchemy models. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily reflecting potential misuse if 'variables' are maliciously crafted, but this is inherent to dynamic code generation rather than malicious code. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety in a supply chain context, assuming controlled input."
