  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with scores reflecting low malware likelihood (~0.2). Report 3's suspicious features justify a higher malware score (~0.6) and risk (~0.7). The assessments are consistent, and the scores appropriately represent the security posture of each dependency."
