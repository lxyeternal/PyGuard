{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific task or function within a larger Python project. Without explicit comments or context, it is unclear what the core intent is, but it appears to be utility or application logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, user input via input() calls, environment variables, or external files. It may also import modules that provide additional data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially writes data to files, databases, or network connections. It may also execute system commands or invoke subprocesses, which could be sinks if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions, possibly passing untrusted data into sinks like system commands, network requests, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are immediately evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. No suspicious network domains or data exfiltration code is visible. The code structure appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations such as input handling, data processing, and output. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network communication. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, with no suspicious patterns. There are no insecure practices like unsanitized SQL queries, insecure randomness, or environment variable misuse. The code's overall design and behavior are consistent with normal application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious activity. It appears to be standard, benign Python code with no clear security threats or malware indicators.",
