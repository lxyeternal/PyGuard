  "purpose": "Provides ORM CRUD utility methods via a class decorator, dynamically importing a model class based on a string path and adding methods for save, delete, update, getId, and getAll operations.",
  "sources": "The dynamic import of the model class using importlib.import_module with the provided model_class_path string.",
  "sinks": "Database session operations, including adding, querying, updating, and deleting ORM objects; removal of internal SQLAlchemy state via __delattr__.",
  "flows": "Input: model_class_path string; Flow: importlib.import_module -> get_model_class -> ORM session queries and modifications -> return ORM objects after cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of __delattr__ to remove '_sa_instance_state', dynamic import based on external input without validation, presence of debug print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM utility decorator that adds CRUD methods to a class, utilizing dynamic import to load model classes. No malicious code, network activity, or sabotage is present. The main security concern is the unvalidated use of model_class_path in importlib.import_module, which could be exploited if the input is untrusted, leading to arbitrary module loading. The removal of '_sa_instance_state' is typical for ORM object serialization. Debug print statements are benign but should be removed in production. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The dynamic import risk warrants a moderate security risk score, but no malware is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard ORM utility with dynamic class loading. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is the potential for exploitation if the model_class_path input is untrusted; validating or whitelisting this input would mitigate this risk. Malware score remains at 0; obfuscated code is not present; security risk is moderate (~0.2).",
