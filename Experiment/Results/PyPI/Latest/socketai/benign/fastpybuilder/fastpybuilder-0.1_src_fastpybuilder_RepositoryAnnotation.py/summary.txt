  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard ORM utility with dynamic class loading. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is the potential for exploitation if the model_class_path input is untrusted; validating or whitelisting this input would mitigate this risk. Malware score remains at 0; obfuscated code is not present; security risk is moderate (~0.2)."
