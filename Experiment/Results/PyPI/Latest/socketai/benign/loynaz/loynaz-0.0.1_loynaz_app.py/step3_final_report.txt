  "purpose": "A command-line utility that reads a graph in DIMACS format, performs approximate, brute-force, and exact algorithms for the edge dominating set problem, logs activities, and outputs results.",
  "sources": "Input file specified by the user, read via parser.read(inputFile). External modules (algorithm, parser, utils, applogger) receive data for processing.",
  "sinks": "External modules (algorithm, parser, utils, applogger) receive data; no direct sinks for untrusted data within this script. No network or file output beyond logging and printing.",
  "flows": "Input file -> parser.read() -> algorithm functions -> utils.string_result_format() -> utils.println() -> output/logging",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a CLI wrapper for graph algorithms, performing argument parsing, logging, reading input files, calling external modules for computations, and printing results. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The reliance on external modules introduces some dependency trust, but within this code, no malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The input data could be malicious if crafted, but the script itself handles it safely. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for graph analysis with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
