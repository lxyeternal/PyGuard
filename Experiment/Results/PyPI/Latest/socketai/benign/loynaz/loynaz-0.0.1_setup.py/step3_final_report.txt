  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description during setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reads static file; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a static README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and console scripts. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or processing of untrusted input. The use of Path().read_text() is standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score is justified by the standard practice of reading external files during setup, which is generally safe.",
