  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'loynaz', including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, and README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md → setting up package metadata → defining entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network, file system, or environmental data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. It reads the README.md file for long description, which is typical. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected. The dependencies and URLs point to legitimate sources. No apparent malicious intent or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration for 'loynaz'. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
