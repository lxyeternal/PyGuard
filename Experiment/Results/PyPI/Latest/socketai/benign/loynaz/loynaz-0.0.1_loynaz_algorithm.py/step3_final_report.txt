  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute approximate and exact minimum edge dominating sets in undirected graphs using standard algorithms, including line graph transformation, Baldor's approximation, and brute-force enumeration.",
  "sources": "Reads input graph object, processes connected components, subgraphs, and applies algorithms; no external data input or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Returns sets of edges or vertices; no data leaks, external communication, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Processes graph to remove self-loops and isolates -> transforms subgraphs into line graphs -> applies algorithms -> outputs dominating sets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard graph processing techniques with clear logic. It removes self-loops and isolates, handles small components efficiently, transforms graphs into line graphs for approximation, and uses brute-force for exact solutions. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The external dependencies are common for graph algorithms. The code's structure and comments are straightforward, indicating legitimate use. The only minor concern is the resource-intensive brute-force method, which is a known trade-off for exact solutions but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of algorithms for computing edge dominating sets in graphs. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk score reflects the resource cost of brute-force enumeration, not security issues.",
