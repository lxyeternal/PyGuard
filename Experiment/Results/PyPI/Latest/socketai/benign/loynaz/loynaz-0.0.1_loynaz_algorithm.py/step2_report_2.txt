  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard graph processing to find approximate and exact edge dominating sets. It removes self-loops and isolates, uses well-known algorithms, and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — minimal, standard graph algorithms.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code employs standard techniques and external libraries for approximation and brute-force exact solutions. No suspicious external communication or malicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but still low; perhaps due to the brute-force method's computational expense or the use of external libraries.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code again follows standard practices for graph processing, with no signs of malicious intent. Uses common algorithms and external libraries legitimately.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, likely due to the computational intensity of brute-force.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, employing known algorithms and standard graph transformations. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with standard methods and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is legitimate, performing standard graph processing with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1–0.2) likely due to the brute-force method's computational expense, not malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to brute-force computational cost, not security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate implementation of graph algorithms for edge dominating sets, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The minor risk score reflects computational intensity, not security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Score |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | 0             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0             |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1           |\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
