{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates batch processing to compute approximate solutions for the edge dominating set problem on multiple graph files in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "User-provided input directory path via command-line argument; file names retrieved from utils.get_file_names.",
  "sinks": "The code calls functions in utils and app modules, which are not provided, potentially executing external or untrusted code, but no direct data sinks or malicious actions are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> utils.get_file_names -> iteration over file names -> constructing file paths -> app.approximate_solution calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The script appears straightforward and standard for command-line processing.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to configure the batch processing of graph files. It uses standard libraries and functions to retrieve filenames and process them through the app module. There are no external network calls, file manipulations beyond reading, or other suspicious activities. The only external dependencies are utils and app modules, which are not included for review, but their usage appears consistent with typical modular design. No hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate batch processing script for graph analysis with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the provided fragment.",
