{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface to process graph files in a specified directory, invoking external modules to compute approximate solutions for the edge dominating set problem.",
  "sources": "The code reads input directory path from command-line arguments and retrieves filenames via utils.get_file_names.",
  "sinks": "The code passes filenames to app.approximate_solution; no untrusted data is processed directly within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input directory path -> utils.get_file_names -> iteration over filenames -> app.approximate_solution with each filename",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that delegates core processing to external modules. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted data beyond filename passing. External modules are not provided, but their usage appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line interface for batch processing graph files, with no malicious intent or security risks apparent. External dependencies could pose risks if compromised, but based solely on this code, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
