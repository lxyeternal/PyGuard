{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to process graph data files from a specified directory and compute approximate solutions for the edge dominating set problem using various algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input directory path provided via command-line argument; file names retrieved by utils.get_file_names; file paths constructed and passed to app.approximate_solution.",
  "sinks": "The file paths passed to app.approximate_solution could potentially be unsafe if they are influenced by untrusted input, but the code only constructs paths using provided arguments and internal functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → approximate_solutions() → utils.get_file_names() and file path construction → app.approximate_solution() with file path as input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external network connections or data leaks are evident. The code relies on external modules (utils, app) but does not show their internal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line arguments and calls functions from imported modules (utils, app). It constructs file paths based on user input and iterates over files to process them. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious logic is present in this snippet. The logic appears standard for batch processing of graph data files with configurable options. The only potential concern is if the utils or app modules perform malicious actions, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical batch processing task with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input insecurely nor execute arbitrary code based on user input within this snippet. Overall, the code appears safe.",
