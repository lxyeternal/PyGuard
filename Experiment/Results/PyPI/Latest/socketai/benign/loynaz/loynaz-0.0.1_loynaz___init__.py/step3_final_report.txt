  "purpose": "Declaration of public API modules for the 'loynaz' package, specifying exported submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only defines a static list '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module declaration listing public API modules. It contains no executable logic, external interactions, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified and consistent.",
