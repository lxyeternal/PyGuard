{
  "purpose": "Provides a list of module names related to the Loynaz package, likely used for organizing or exporting functionalities.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only declares a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns present; the code is straightforward and typical for a module's __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines the __all__ list to specify exported modules or attributes, a common practice in Python packages. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The comments indicate the package's purpose and author but do not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module declaration without any malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose a security risk.",
