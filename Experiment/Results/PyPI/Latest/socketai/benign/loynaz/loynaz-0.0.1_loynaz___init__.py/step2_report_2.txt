  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward `__all__` declaration listing module names.\n- There are no indications of data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n- The code is minimal, standard for a Python package's initialization or API declaration.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is simply defining `__all__` with a list of module names.\n   - No actual code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**\n   - Since the code is a simple module declaration with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The reports' scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard `__all__` declaration, typical for Python package modules.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security concerns are present.",
