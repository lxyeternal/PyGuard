  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, sparse matrix manipulation, graph conversion, and analysis.",
  "sources": "os.listdir, os.path functions, numpy, scipy.sparse, networkx",
  "sinks": "Local data processing; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions, no external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for file operations, matrix and graph processing, and simple algorithms. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or external data leaks are present. The functions perform standard operations with clear logic. The print statement in generate_short_hash for invalid input is benign. Overall, the code is transparent and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a utility library for graph and matrix operations, suitable for use in security-sensitive environments.",
