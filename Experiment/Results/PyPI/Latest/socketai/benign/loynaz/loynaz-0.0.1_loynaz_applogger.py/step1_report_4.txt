{
  "purpose": "Provide different logging mechanisms including console, file, and wrapped logger for application debugging and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Inputs are messages passed to the info methods of Logger, ConsoleLogger, and FileLogger classes.",
  "sinks": "The code formats and outputs log messages to console or file; no untrusted data is transmitted or stored beyond local logs.",
  "flows": "Input messages flow from method calls to either print or logging functions; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The code follows standard logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for logging purposes: Logger (a wrapper for an existing logger), ConsoleLogger (logs to console if enabled), and FileLogger (logs to a file with configurable level). Each class uses safe and standard methods for logging and message formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The format strings are safely used with format(), and no dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The only minor note is the use of self.logger in FileLogger, which is standard; no unsafe operations are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly implements logging functionalities without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
