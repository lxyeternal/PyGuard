{
  "purpose": "Provide logging functionalities through different classes: wrapped logger, console logger, and file logger.",
  "sources": "Logger class accepts a logger object; ConsoleLogger and FileLogger accept configuration parameters for logging output.",
  "sinks": "Log messages are sent to console or log file; no untrusted input is explicitly read or processed as data sources.",
  "flows": "Log messages originate from method calls and are routed to console or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard logging and printing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for logging: Logger (wraps a provided logger object), ConsoleLogger (logs to stdout if enabled), and FileLogger (logs to a specified file). The ConsoleLogger uses print with string formatting, which could potentially be exploited if msg or args are user-controlled, but no specific untrusted input handling is present. The FileLogger uses Python's logging module with default configurations, with no indication of malicious or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious behavior patterns are evident. The code appears to be standard, benign logging utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility with no malicious behavior detected. It performs basic logging functions with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
