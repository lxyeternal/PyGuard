{
  "purpose": "The code provides various logging classes for different output methods, including console and file logging, with a wrapper class for a logger object.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (log_enabled, log_file, log_level) and message inputs in info methods.",
  "sinks": "The log messages are formatted and written either to the console or to a file, based on the logger configuration.",
  "flows": "Input data (log messages and configuration flags) flow into the info methods, which then pass formatted messages to the underlying logger or print to console.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. The print statement uses message formatting but is benign. No external or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes different logger classes for console and file output, with configurable options. The ConsoleLogger uses print for output, formatting messages via str.format. FileLogger configures the standard logging module, writing logs to a specified file with a given level. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or data leaks. The structure is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious code or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors. It simply provides utility logging classes with proper configuration options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing standard logging functionality without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
