{
  "purpose": "The code provides three logger classes for different logging mechanisms: wrapper for an existing logger, console logging, and file logging.",
  "sources": "Input data includes log messages passed to info() methods in each class.",
  "sinks": "Log messages are written to console or file, but no untrusted data directly affects system state or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Log message passed from caller -> info() method -> formatted -> output to console or file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard logging practices, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes: Logger, ConsoleLogger, and FileLogger, each handling logging in different ways. All logging methods simply pass messages to underlying Python logging library or print statements. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or untrusted data streams, nor any code that dynamically executes external code or manages secrets. The formatting of messages is straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in the implementation. The classes appear to serve standard logging functions, and no malicious or security-threatening actions are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard logging utility implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for application logging purposes.",
