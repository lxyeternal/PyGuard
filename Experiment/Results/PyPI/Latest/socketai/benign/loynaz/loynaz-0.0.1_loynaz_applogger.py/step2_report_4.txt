  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, benign logging utility.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar benign logging utility; mention of potential formatting concerns if inputs are untrusted.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk due to potential formatting issues if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious behavior. The score seems reasonable given the context.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same benign utility; no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; standard logging classes.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; straightforward logging.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, possibly due to the print statement formatting, but still benign.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low overall; minor variations due to potential formatting concerns, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a maximum of 0.1-0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minor concerns about message formatting if inputs are untrusted but no real security risk.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign logging utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for minor formatting concerns, but overall very low risk)",
