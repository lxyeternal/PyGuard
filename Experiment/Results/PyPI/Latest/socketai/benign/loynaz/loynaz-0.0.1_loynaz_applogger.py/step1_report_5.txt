{
  "purpose": "Provides different logging mechanisms (console, file, wrapper) for an application.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading from external sources or untrusted data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console or file; no data leaks or external transmissions detected.",
  "flows": "Code flow from method calls (info) to print statements or logger methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes for logging: Logger, ConsoleLogger, and FileLogger. Each class handles logging to different outputs with configurable options. The implementation uses standard Python logging and printing mechanisms. There are no evident data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors. The print statement in ConsoleLogger could be misused for information disclosure if used improperly, but it is part of intended logging functionality. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured logging module.",
