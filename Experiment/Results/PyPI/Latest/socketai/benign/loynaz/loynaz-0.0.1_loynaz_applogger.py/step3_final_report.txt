{
  "purpose": "Provides logging classes for console, file, and wrapper around existing loggers to facilitate logging in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters 'msg', 'args', and 'kwargs' in the logging methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data sources; no network or file output beyond standard logging.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the logger methods, which then format and output messages via print or logging mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes: 'Logger' as a wrapper, 'ConsoleLogger' for console output, and 'FileLogger' for file logging. All use standard Python logging practices or print statements. No external data sources, network activity, or secret handling present. Message formatting uses str.format, which could be misused if inputs are untrusted, but no such inputs are shown. No obfuscation or malicious code identified. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of log message formatting, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward logging utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor risk score reflects the potential for misuse if log messages contain sensitive data, but the code itself is safe.",
