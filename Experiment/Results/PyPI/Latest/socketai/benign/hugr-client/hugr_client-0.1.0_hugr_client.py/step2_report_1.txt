  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and assess the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate data processing library for geospatial data, with no malicious behavior. It handles environment variables, data decoding, and visualization securely.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily about data retrieval, decoding, and visualization. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions for geometry decoding are standard and rely on well-known libraries.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate.** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to handling external data and environment variables, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, and safe data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The functions for data decoding and visualization are standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for data handling code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on multipart response parsing, data decoding, and visualization, with no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The functions for parsing, decoding, and visualizing are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. Use of environment variables for configuration is typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — low.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe handling of spatial data, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution. Use of standard libraries and practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles multipart responses, spatial data, and visualization, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The functions for parsing, decoding, and visualization are standard. No obfuscated code or backdoors. Use of environment variables is typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, typical for networked data processing code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports agree the code is legitimate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity, payloads, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, given the code handles external data and environment variables, but nothing suspicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **accurate.** No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Based on the reports, a conservative but justified score of **0.1–0.2** seems appropriate, considering external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — standard data processing code with external inputs, but no security flaws or malicious intent.\n\n**In conclusion, the code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation.**",
