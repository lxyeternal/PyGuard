  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent geospatial data handling library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling external data and environment variables, which is typical for such applications. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard low-level concerns."
