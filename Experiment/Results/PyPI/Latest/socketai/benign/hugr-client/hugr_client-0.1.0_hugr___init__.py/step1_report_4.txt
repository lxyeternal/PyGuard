{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be an import and export interface for a client library related to 'Hugr', likely facilitating communication with a service or database.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the 'client' module, specifically importing classes and functions such as HugrClient, connect, and query.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code mainly defines exports and version information without handling untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present in this code snippet; it merely re-exports imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation indicators. The code is straightforward, defining module exports and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a local module named 'client' and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It also sets a version string. No processing, input handling, or potentially risky behavior is evident. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is a typical module interface setup with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines what parts of the 'client' module are publicly available and sets a version number.",
