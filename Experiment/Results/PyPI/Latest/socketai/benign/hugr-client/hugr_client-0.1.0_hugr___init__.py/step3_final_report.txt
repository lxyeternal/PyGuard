  "purpose": "Module setup and re-export of classes/functions for a Python package, facilitating API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local '.client' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports from '.client' serve as sources; no untrusted data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific classes and functions from a local module, defines __all__ for public API, and sets a static version string. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external input handling. The structure is typical for package initialization files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
