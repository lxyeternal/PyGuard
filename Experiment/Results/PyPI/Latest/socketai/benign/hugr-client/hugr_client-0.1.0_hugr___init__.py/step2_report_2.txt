  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports classes/functions from a local 'client' module, defines __all__, and sets a version string.\n- None of the reports identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: module setup, API exposure, or package initialization.\n- No external data, network operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely import/export, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows from untrusted sources, no handling of sensitive data, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The version string is static and standard.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since the code is so minimal, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
