{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py module that imports specific classes and functions from a 'client' module and defines the public API for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .client, version string definition",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows or data processing in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports several classes and functions related to a client interface and exposes them through __all__. The version string is a static assignment. There are no functions or data processing, no user input handling, and no network or file operations. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initialization that defines the public API for a package. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security issues are present.",
