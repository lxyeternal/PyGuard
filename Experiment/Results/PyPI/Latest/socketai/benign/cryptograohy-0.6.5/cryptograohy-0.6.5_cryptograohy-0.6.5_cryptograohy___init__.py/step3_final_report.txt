{
  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "The call to cli() may execute code within the cli() function, potentially handling untrusted input if not properly secured.",
  "flows": "Import of cli() followed by immediate execution; data flow depends on cli() implementation, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports greet and cli functions, then calls cli() immediately upon import. This pattern is typical for CLI tools. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are visible. The security implications depend on the implementation of cli(), which is not provided. The immediate execution of cli() is standard but warrants review of cli() for handling untrusted input. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent. The immediate call to cli() is common in CLI applications but should be reviewed in context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) reflecting typical CLI pattern concerns.",
