  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent. The immediate call to cli() is common in CLI applications but should be reviewed in context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) reflecting typical CLI pattern concerns."
