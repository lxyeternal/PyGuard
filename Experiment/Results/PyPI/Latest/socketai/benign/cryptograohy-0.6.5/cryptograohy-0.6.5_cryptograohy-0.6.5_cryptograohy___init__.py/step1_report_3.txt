  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functions and executing a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules; execution of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function execution may be a sink if it runs untrusted code or executes external commands.",
  "flows": "Importing modules (core and cly), then calling cli() which may run code from cly module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code directly calls cli() on import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules: core and cly, then immediately invokes cli(). This pattern suggests that the package executes a command-line interface upon import, which can be risky if the cli() function performs untrusted or malicious operations. However, without the implementation of cli(), it is not possible to determine definitively if malicious activity occurs. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated code, no suspicious variables, and no external data sources. The immediate invocation of cli() could be considered a design concern but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and lacks evidence of malicious behavior. The immediate call to cli() upon import could lead to unexpected command execution but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
