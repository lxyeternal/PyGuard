  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of 'cli()' on import without any conditional guard; no apparent validation or security checks",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'greet' and 'cli' functions from local modules. It then directly calls 'cli()' at import time, which likely starts the command-line interface. This behavior could be suspicious if 'cli()' executes user commands or processes untrusted input without validation. However, based solely on this snippet, no malicious code or hardcoded secrets are evident. The pattern of immediate CLI invocation is common in CLI applications but warrants scrutiny for potential unintended execution side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports and executes a CLI function upon module load. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this limited snippet. The immediate invocation of 'cli()' is typical in CLI tools but should be reviewed in context for unintended side effects.",
