  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package and execute the CLI interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core functions and CLI, execution of cli()",
  "sinks": "Execution of cli() could potentially execute untrusted code if cli() is maliciously altered",
  "flows": "import .core.greet and .cly.cli, then call cli() directly",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from internal modules and immediately invokes cli(). The cli() function's implementation is not provided, so its behavior cannot be fully assessed. The pattern is typical for a CLI entry point. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are evident in this snippet. The code relies on internal modules, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code execution here.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization script that imports functions and runs a CLI. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent from this snippet.",
