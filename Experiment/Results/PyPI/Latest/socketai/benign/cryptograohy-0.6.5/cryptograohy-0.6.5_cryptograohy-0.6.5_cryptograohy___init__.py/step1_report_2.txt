  "purpose": "Initialize the asciidrawing package by importing core functionalities and CLI, then executing the command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements for .core and .cly modules, and the invocation of cli() function.",
  "sinks": "The cli() function call could potentially be a sink if it executes untrusted code or input, but in this context, it is assumed to be a standard CLI entry point.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call cli() function, which may process command-line arguments or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The cli() function is invoked immediately, which is standard for CLI apps.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules, 'core' and 'cly', and then executes the cli() function from 'cly'. There are no visible data sources or untrusted data flows directly in this snippet. The immediate call to cli() is typical for CLI tools. Without inspecting the modules themselves, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script for a CLI tool. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior based on the provided snippet. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
