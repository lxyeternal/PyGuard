{
  "purpose": "The code performs post-installation actions by installing 'pyprettifier' during setup, then importing and initializing it, with exception logging to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call to 'pip install pyprettifier' and the import of 'pyprettifier' after installation.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of malicious code if 'pyprettifier' is compromised, especially during dynamic installation and import.",
  "flows": "The setup process executes subprocess to install package -> imports 'pyprettifier' -> creates 'EmojiConverter' instance; exceptions are caught and logged.",
  "anomalies": "Installing dependencies during setup, broad exception handling, silent error logging, misspelled package name 'cryptograohy'.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically installs an external package during setup, which is unconventional and poses supply chain risks. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors that could mask malicious activity. The misspelling of the package name may be obfuscation. No malicious payloads are directly evident, but the pattern of behavior allows for potential exploitation if the external package is malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The main concern is the security risk introduced by runtime dependency installation and silent error handling, which could be exploited if the external package is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "While no direct malicious activity is present, the code's approach to dynamically installing dependencies during setup and silent error logging introduces significant supply chain and security risks. The package should be reviewed thoroughly, especially the external dependency, and best practices should be followed to avoid such risky patterns.",
