  "purpose": "Initialize a CLI component by importing a third-party library and creating an EmojiConverter instance.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pyprettifier' within the cli() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate EmojiConverter -> function call",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional local import inside a function, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a minimal setup: it imports a library locally within a function, creates an object, and executes the function. No input/output, network activity, or data processing occurs. The import style is unusual but not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The local import does not constitute a security concern. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the absence of malicious behavior.",
