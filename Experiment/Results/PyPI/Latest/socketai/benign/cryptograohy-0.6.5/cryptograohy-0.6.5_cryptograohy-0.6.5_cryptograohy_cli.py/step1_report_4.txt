{
  "purpose": "Initialize and run the CLI function which imports a library and creates an object",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and object instantiation 'pyprettifier.EmojiConverter()'",
  "sinks": "Object instantiation from 'pyprettifier', no untrusted data handling or output points evident",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyprettifier' -> creation of 'EmojiConverter' object",
  "anomalies": "Unusual for import to be inside a function; no additional code or logic; no hardcoded secrets or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'pyprettifier' within a function and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. The import is local to the function, which is somewhat unconventional but not inherently malicious. The code performs no data processing, network activity, or other suspicious actions. The library 'pyprettifier' is assumed to be a legitimate package without obvious malicious intent based on this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The local import and object creation are typical operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
