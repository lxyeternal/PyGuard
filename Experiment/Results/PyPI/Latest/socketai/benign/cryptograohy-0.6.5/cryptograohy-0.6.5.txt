      "conclusion": "While no direct malicious activity is present, the code's approach to dynamically installing dependencies during setup and silent error logging introduces significant supply chain and security risks. The package should be reviewed thoroughly, especially the external dependency, and best practices should be followed to avoid such risky patterns."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) reflecting typical CLI pattern concerns."
