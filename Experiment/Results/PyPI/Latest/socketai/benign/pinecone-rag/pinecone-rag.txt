      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score in previous reports (0.1) is unwarranted; the appropriate score is 0. All reports correctly identified the benign nature, with the exception of a slight overestimation in one case. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity."
