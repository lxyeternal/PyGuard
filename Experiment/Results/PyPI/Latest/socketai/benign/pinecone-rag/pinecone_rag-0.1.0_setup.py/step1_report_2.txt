  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pinecone_rag' intended for use in Pinecone RAG operations.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies from 'install_requires', reading long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling, network connections, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A — typical setup process, no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously behaving code elements are present. The dependencies are common packages for NLP and Pinecone integration. No network calls or data leaks are apparent. All operations are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package setup tasks safely.",
