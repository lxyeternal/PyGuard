{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'pinecone_rag' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'README.md' file read for the long description and the install_requires list for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve untrusted data being processed or dependencies being downloaded, but none are explicitly malicious.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows involving untrusted input; dependencies are specified but not fetched or executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file to include a long description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. Dependencies are specified with version constraints, and author information is included. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical configuration tasks for package distribution.",
