  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pinecone_rag' used for Pinecone RAG operations.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package directories, author info, description files, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input data from package dependencies, metadata, and file reads flow into package setup configuration without risky handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine for a Python package. It specifies dependencies, package directories, author info, description, and metadata, all in a straightforward manner. No suspicious functions, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of 'open' to read the README.md is standard and safe. The dependencies are version-locked but do not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code.",
