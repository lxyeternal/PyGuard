  "purpose": "This code defines an import from a local module and specifies the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only references an internal module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, which is a common pattern in Python packages. It then defines __all__ to control what is exported. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code does not handle any user input, network operations, or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that manages imports and exports. No malicious or security concerns are present in this snippet.",
