  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only sets up module exports and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and explicitly exports it. It is a standard Python module pattern with no signs of malicious behavior. The simplicity and clarity reduce suspicion, and there are no operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
