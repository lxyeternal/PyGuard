{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports a class named BaseModel from a relative package and exposes it via the __all__ attribute for controlled public API export.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module .base_model to import BaseModel.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, as no untrusted data or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only performs a static import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and specifies the public API. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. Its simplicity suggests standard module packaging. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module that exports a class from a local package. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security concerns.",
