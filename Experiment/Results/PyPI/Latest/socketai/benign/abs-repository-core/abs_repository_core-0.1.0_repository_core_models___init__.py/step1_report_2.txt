  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a Python module by importing BaseModel from a local module and specifying it as an export.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .base_model import BaseModel",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or pose security risks",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or sensitive information",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard module setup, no unusual or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module export statement. It imports a class from a sibling module and declares it as publicly accessible. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code structure is typical for Python modules and does not involve any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
