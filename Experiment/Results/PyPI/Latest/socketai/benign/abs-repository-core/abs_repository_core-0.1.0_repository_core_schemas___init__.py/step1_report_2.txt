{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and imports specific classes and functions from local modules, likely for schema validation or data modeling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.base_schema and ..utils.schema)",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or used; no data leak points or dangerous operations",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules are only used to make classes/functions available for other parts of the application",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports several schema-related classes and a utility function, then exposes them via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime operations that could involve untrusted input or malicious behavior. The import paths are relative and suggest a modular structure. No indicators of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a straightforward schema export file within a larger codebase.",
