  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, examining the scores, and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and an `__all__` declaration.\n- There are no dynamic operations, no input/output handling, no data processing, and no external communication.\n- The import paths are relative, indicating internal modular structure.\n- The code is a typical pattern for defining module exports in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as module setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, correctly notes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly describes the code as a benign export setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, straightforward import/export pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malicious code?**  \n  No. The code is static, simple import/export declarations.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Is there any suspicious claim?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the benign purpose.\n\n- **Is the confidence level justified?**  \n  Yes, 1 (100%) confidence is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, no security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Your own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard module import/export setup with no security concerns. All scores and conclusions are justified.",
