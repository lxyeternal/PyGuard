  "purpose": "The code defines a function to create a new Pydantic model with all fields made optional, preserving validation constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions of Pydantic models via 'model.model_fields' and 'model.model_json_schema()'. It extracts schema constraints from the model's JSON schema.",
  "sinks": "The code creates a new model using 'create_model' and 'Field', which could potentially accept malicious constraints if manipulated, but in normal operation it only constructs data models.",
  "flows": "Schema extraction from 'model_json_schema()' → constraints mapping → creation of optional fields with 'create_model' → return of new model with optional fields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or dynamic execution. The code relies on schema properties and standard Pydantic methods without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves schema constraints from a Pydantic model's JSON schema, then constructs a new model with all fields optional but retains validation rules via constraints. It uses 'model_fields' and 'model_json_schema()' which are standard methods. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The process appears to be safe model manipulation, primarily for flexible validation. No external inputs or network activity are involved. The approach is consistent with typical dynamic model creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for transforming a Pydantic model to an all-optional version, maintaining validation constraints. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is benign and safe.",
