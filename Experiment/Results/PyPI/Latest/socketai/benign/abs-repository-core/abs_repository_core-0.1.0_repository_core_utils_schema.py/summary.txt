  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for transforming Pydantic models into optional versions, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only technical issue is the inclusion of 'error_messages' in Field(), which should be corrected but does not pose security concerns. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate."
