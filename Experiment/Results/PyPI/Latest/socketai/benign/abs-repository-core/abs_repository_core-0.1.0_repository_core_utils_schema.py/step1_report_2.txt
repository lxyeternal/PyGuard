{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically creates an optional version of a given Pydantic model by converting all its fields to optional and preserving validation constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads the original model's schema via model.model_json_schema() and its fields via model.model_fields.",
  "sinks": "The code generates a new model using create_model, which is a standard Pydantic function; no untrusted data sink or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "The code extracts schema constraints from the original model, then constructs new optional fields with these constraints, and creates a new model class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident. The code performs standard schema processing.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defines a function to generate an optional version of a Pydantic model. It retrieves the model's JSON schema and fields, then iterates over each field to copy constraints like min, max, length, and pattern. It constructs new optional fields with these constraints and uses create_model to generate a new model class. All operations are within normal schema and model creation workflows without any suspicious behavior or external data transmission. No malicious activities, backdoors, or malware are present. The code strictly manipulates model schemas and fields, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for Pydantic models, enabling optional fields while preserving validation constraints. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
