{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates an optional version of a given Pydantic model by making all fields optional while preserving validation constraints.",
  "sources": "Reads model schema via model.model_json_schema() and model fields via model.model_fields.",
  "sinks": "Creates a new Pydantic model with fields set to Optional, potentially used elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "Extracts schema constraints from the original model, applies them to new optional fields, and constructs a new model class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code only manipulates Pydantic models and schema constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects a Pydantic model's JSON schema and internal fields to generate a new model where all fields are optional. It carefully copies validation constraints such as minimum, maximum, length, and pattern restrictions. The use of model.model_json_schema() and model.model_fields indicates reliance on Pydantic internals but no malicious behavior. No external data is fetched or transmitted. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is present. The process is purely schema and type manipulation to generate flexible models.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely generates an optional variant of a Pydantic model, preserving validation rules without any malicious intent or security risks.",
