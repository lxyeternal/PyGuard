  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates a new Pydantic model with all fields made optional, preserving validation constraints.",
  "sources": "model.model_json_schema(), model.model_fields, properties from JSON schema",
  "sinks": "create_model function (dynamic model creation), Field construction with constraints",
  "flows": "Reads model schema and fields, processes constraints, constructs new optional model with preserved constraints",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Pydantic APIs, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code extracts JSON schema from a Pydantic model, iterates over its fields, copies validation constraints, and constructs a new model where all fields are optional. It carefully preserves constraints such as minimum, maximum, pattern, and length constraints. The use of create_model and Field with constraints is standard for dynamic model creation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any I/O, network, or system operations that could be malicious. It is a utility function for model manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility to create optional versions of existing Pydantic models, preserving validation constraints. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It appears safe and legitimate.",
