{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to convert all fields of a given Pydantic model into optional fields while preserving validation constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Pydantic model's schema via model.model_json_schema() and accesses model.model_fields to gather field definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data outputs; the code solely constructs and returns a new model class.",
  "flows": "The function extracts schema constraints, maps them to optional field definitions, and creates a new model class with these optional fields.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior. The code uses standard Pydantic methods and Python features without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function that processes a Pydantic model, and constructs a new model with all fields made optional while copying validation constraints. It accesses schema information via model.model_json_schema() and model.model_fields, which are standard Pydantic attributes. It maps schema constraints to Field parameters appropriately, creating a new model with optional fields. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for modifying Pydantic models, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely generates an optional version of a given model while preserving validation constraints.",
