  "purpose": "This code exports the BaseService class for use in other modules, likely part of a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "The code imports BaseService from a relative module (.base_service).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of BaseService and its inclusion in the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines the public API of the module with __all__. No user input, external data, or risky operations are present. The absence of additional logic indicates it is likely a standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, functioning as a module initializer or export list with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
