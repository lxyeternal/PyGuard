  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.base_service' to import BaseService.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statement from a local module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named BaseService from a relative module and exposes it via __all__, indicating that this is part of a package's public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The simplicity and directness suggest it is a normal module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an import/export declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
