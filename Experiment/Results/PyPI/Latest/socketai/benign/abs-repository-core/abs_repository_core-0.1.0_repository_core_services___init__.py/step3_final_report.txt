  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, a standard Python pattern. No untrusted data, external communication, or suspicious logic is present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
