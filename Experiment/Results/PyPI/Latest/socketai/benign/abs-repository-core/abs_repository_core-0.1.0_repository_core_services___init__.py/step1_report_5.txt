{
  "purpose": "This code defines the module exports for a package, specifically exposing the 'BaseService' class imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __all__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only performs an import and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python syntax. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'BaseService' from a local module, then sets '__all__' to expose 'BaseService' as part of the module's public API. There are no functions, user input, network operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The code is very simple and follows standard conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module export definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
