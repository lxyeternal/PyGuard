  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization with version metadata.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data reading, or data output; only a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with a docstring and a version string assignment. No inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code content. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
