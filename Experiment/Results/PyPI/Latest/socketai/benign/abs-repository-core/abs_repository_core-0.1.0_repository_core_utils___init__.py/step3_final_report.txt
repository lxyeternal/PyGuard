  "purpose": "Re-export of the make_optional function from the local schema module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .schema module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Import from .schema -> __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a single function and exposes it via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and static nature strongly suggest benign intent. All signals, including the absence of suspicious patterns, support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module re-export with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
