{
  "purpose": "Export the 'make_optional' function or object from the local 'schema' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.schema).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a straightforward import and export statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function or object 'make_optional' from a relative module 'schema' and exposes it via __all__ for public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The simplicity and standard structure indicate typical module export behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase, facilitating access to 'make_optional'.",
