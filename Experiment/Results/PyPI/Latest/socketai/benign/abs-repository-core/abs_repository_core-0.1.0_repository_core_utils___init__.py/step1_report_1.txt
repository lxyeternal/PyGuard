  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'make_optional' from a local module 'schema' and exposes it for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'schema' to import 'make_optional'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'make_optional' in the local module to exposing it via __all__ for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a function from a local module and defining an export list. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no external network interactions, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard module setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply re-exports a function for external use.",
