  "purpose": "The code is designed to define and export a single function or object 'make_optional' imported from a local schema module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'make_optional' identifier from the local module '.schema'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues, as no runtime data processing or external data handling is present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function or object from a local module, then defines '__all__' for export. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or operations that could be malicious. The code is clean, simple, and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module import and export statement with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
