{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting a function or object called 'make_optional' from the local schema module, likely to be used in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement 'from .schema import make_optional', which reads from a local module file 'schema'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only imports and defines what to export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'make_optional' from a local module 'schema', then declares '__all__' to explicitly export 'make_optional'. It serves as a simple module initializer or re-export file. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is standard and minimal, with no complex logic, external network calls, or handling of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign re-export of a local function or object, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe module fragment.",
