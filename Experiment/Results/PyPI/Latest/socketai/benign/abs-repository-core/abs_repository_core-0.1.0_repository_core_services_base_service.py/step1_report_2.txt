{
  "purpose": "The code defines protocols and a base service class for repository interactions, facilitating CRUD operations and data retrieval in an application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'schema', 'id', 'attr', 'value', and 'searchable_fields' in various methods; data passed to repository methods.",
  "sinks": "Repository method calls with untrusted input data, especially in methods like 'read_by_options', 'read_by_id', 'update_attr', 'whole_update', 'delete_by_id', 'get_unique_values', and 'read_by_attr'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into repository method calls, which may process or execute database queries based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. Usage of protocols and dependency injection suggests standard design patterns. No signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a protocol for repository interactions and a service layer that delegates CRUD operations to the repository. All inputs are passed directly to repository methods without manipulation or insecure handling. There are no network calls, external data leaks, or code injection points. The structure appears to be standard for application-layer architecture. The methods use untrusted input only as parameters for database operations, which is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard repository-service pattern implementation for data access with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data flow through method parameters, delegating to the repository layer safely within typical application architecture boundaries.",
