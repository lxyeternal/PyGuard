  "purpose": "Define protocols and a base service class for repository interactions, including CRUD operations and data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods such as 'schema', 'id', 'attr', 'value', and 'schemas'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted 'schema', 'attr', 'value', and 'schemas' passed to repository methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into repository methods which perform database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of type hints and method forwarding appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a protocol for repository classes and a base service class that delegates CRUD and data retrieval operations to the repository. All methods are standard CRUD wrappers with no data manipulation, network calls, or file operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The structure relies on interface abstraction, which is common for testability and modularity. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected. The code is typical of a service layer in a clean architecture setup, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign abstraction layer for database operations. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is a typical implementation of a service pattern with no concerning features.",
