  "purpose": "Define data models and schemas for filtering, searching, sorting, and retrieving data in a type-safe manner using Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include external user input for filters, search strings, sorting, pagination, and field values.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable areas include parsing and handling user-defined filter conditions, search strings, and sorting parameters which could influence query construction.",
  "flows": "User inputs (search, filters, sort_orders) flow into models like FilterSchema, SearchOptions, FindBase, and related schemas, which could then be used to generate database queries or API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious code are present. The code strictly defines data schemas and does not include execution logic that could be exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of Pydantic models for constructing query filters, sorting, and pagination parameters. It allows for nested logical conditions and various operators, which if used improperly downstream could lead to injection vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized in query execution. However, within this code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code constructs. It mainly serves as data structure definitions with type annotations. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated patterns are present. The models are straightforward and focus solely on schema validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure and well-structured set of data models intended for safe data handling in applications. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and there are no apparent security risks directly within these definitions. Proper sanitization and parameterization in the query execution layer would be required to ensure complete security.",
