{
  "purpose": "Define data validation schemas for filtering, sorting, and querying operations in a system, ensuring structured input handling.",
  "sources": "Input data such as filter conditions, sort orders, search strings, and pagination parameters provided by users or external systems.",
  "sinks": "Potential downstream database queries or data processing functions that utilize the validated input; no direct data leaks or external calls within this code.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into Pydantic models (FilterSchema, SortOrder, etc.), which validate and structure the data for subsequent use in database or API queries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of schema definitions with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Pydantic models for filtering, sorting, and pagination, with nested logical conditions. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or obfuscated patterns. The models accept untrusted input but do not process it directly; downstream handling (e.g., query construction) must be properly sanitized to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential downstream misuse if inputs are not sanitized. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe as schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard data schemas for filtering and querying, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk is related to downstream handling of user inputs, not inherent in the schemas themselves. Scores are consistent and appropriate.",
