{
  "purpose": "Define data models and schemas for filtering, sorting, and searching data within an application, primarily using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via data models (e.g., FilterSchema, FindBase, SearchOptions, etc.) typically from user requests or external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data storage, database queries, or external APIs where untrusted input may influence query parameters or data processing.",
  "flows": "User input -> data models (filters, sort orders, search terms) -> application logic -> database or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of Pydantic models for schema validation is standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data validation schemas for filtering and searching operations using Pydantic. It includes type constraints and logical conditions for query building. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified. The code is structured as schema definitions without executable or network-related logic. It does not handle or process raw user input directly; such processing would occur elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of schema definitions for data validation and query construction, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation of data models for application filtering and searching features.",
