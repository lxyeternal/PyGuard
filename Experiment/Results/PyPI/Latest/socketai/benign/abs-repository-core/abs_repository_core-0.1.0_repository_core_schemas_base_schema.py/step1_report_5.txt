{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for filtering, sorting, and retrieving data in a structured way, mainly used for search and query operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided filter conditions, search strings, sorting preferences, and pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include handling of untrusted input in filters, search strings, or sorting fields, which could lead to injection if improperly processed downstream.",
  "flows": "User input (filters, search, sort) flows into the data models, which could then be used to generate database queries or other data retrieval actions. No direct code execution or data manipulation is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The models are straightforward data schemas. No dynamic code execution or system manipulation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines Pydantic data models for data filtering, searching, and sorting. These models include conditions, logical groupings, and various parameters. No executable logic or processing is shown that could be exploited. The design appears standard for such purposes. The only potential concern is that untrusted inputs (like filter conditions and search strings) are accepted, but this is typical for query models and requires proper downstream validation, not an inherent risk in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model schemas with no malicious behavior. It appears to be safe and used for structuring query parameters. No malware or security risks are evident within these schema definitions.",
