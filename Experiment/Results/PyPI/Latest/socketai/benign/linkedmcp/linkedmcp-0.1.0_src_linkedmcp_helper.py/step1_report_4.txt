{
  "purpose": "Generate a PDF document from a given text input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' for the function 'generate_pdf_from_text'.",
  "sinks": "The 'pdf.output' method writes the PDF data to an in-memory BytesIO object.",
  "flows": "Text input -> Splits into lines -> Lines added to PDF -> PDF output to BytesIO -> Return PDF bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unusual code structures detected. Use of standard library and common third-party library (FPDF).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to create a PDF file from input text using the FPDF library. It processes the text line-by-line, adding each to the PDF, then outputs the PDF data as bytes. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The function performs a straightforward task of PDF generation with standard libraries and methods, with no obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign PDF generation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely transforms text into a PDF format and returns the resulting bytes.",
