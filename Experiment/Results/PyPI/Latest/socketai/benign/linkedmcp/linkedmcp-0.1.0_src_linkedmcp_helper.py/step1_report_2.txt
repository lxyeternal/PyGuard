{
  "purpose": "Generate a PDF document from input text and return it as bytes",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' (function argument)",
  "sinks": "io.BytesIO() output, pdf.output() writes PDF data into the BytesIO buffer",
  "flows": "text.splitlines() → pdf.multi_cell() → output buffer → return output.getvalue()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; no dynamic code execution or suspicious library usage",
  "analysis": "The function imports 'io' and 'FPDF' to generate a PDF from provided text. It creates a PDF object, adds a page, sets font, and writes each line of input text into the PDF using multi_cell. The PDF is then written into an in-memory bytes buffer and returned. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated logic. The code performs a straightforward text-to-PDF conversion without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of converting text into a PDF file and returning it as bytes. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
