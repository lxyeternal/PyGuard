{
  "purpose": "Generate a PDF document from input text and return it as bytes",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' (function argument), standard library 'io', external library 'fpdf'",
  "sinks": "The 'output' BytesIO object where PDF data is saved, return statement returning PDF bytes",
  "flows": "Input 'text' is processed by splitting lines, then written into the PDF via multi_cell; PDF content is saved to BytesIO and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an FPDF object, adds a page, sets a font, writes each line of input text into the PDF, saves the PDF into a BytesIO buffer, and returns the PDF bytes. No external network access, no hidden or suspicious operations. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of creating a PDF document from text input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to convert text into a PDF and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious activities or data leaks.",
