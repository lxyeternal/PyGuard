  "purpose": "Provides server tools for generating PDFs of cover letters, resumes, LinkedIn profile updates, and manages resource files.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, writes to local files ('resume.txt', 'linkedin.txt'), and reads static resource data from in-memory storage.",
  "sinks": "Writes user-generated content to files, generates PDF files from text, and reads resource data; no network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into file writes and PDF generation functions; resource data is static and read-only; no external network flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded resource data, writes directly to files without validation, and does not sanitize inputs; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward document generation and resource management with standard file I/O and external PDF generation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The lack of input validation poses a potential security concern but does not constitute malicious activity. External library usage appears benign. The resource data is static and in-memory, with no network activity beyond local file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to the absence of input validation and potential for misuse, but these are typical for such internal or prototype tools. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
