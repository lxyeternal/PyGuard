  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to the absence of input validation and potential for misuse, but these are typical for such internal or prototype tools. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."
