  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, its precise intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, databases, network sockets, or outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and then to sinks, possibly involving untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unusual or obfuscated code structures detected. Usage of dynamic execution or suspicious network calls is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and performs typical operations such as data manipulation and I/O. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as network connections to suspicious domains, system modifications, or data exfiltration routines. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated elements. All third-party libraries used are common and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign but lacks specific contextual information to fully confirm intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate purposes, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
