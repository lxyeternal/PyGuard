  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which pose potential security risks but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate and conservative, accurately reflecting suspicion levels without overestimating threat. Continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm safety."
