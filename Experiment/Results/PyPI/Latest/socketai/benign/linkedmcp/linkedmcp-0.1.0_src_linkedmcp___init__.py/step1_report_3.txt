  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing or automation tasks, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, and external data files or network responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections, file writes, and possibly subprocess executions which could be used to exfiltrate data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, files, network) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network sockets, file systems, or command execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python script utilizing common libraries and constructs. It reads input data from standard sources, processes data in a typical manner, and writes output or communicates externally. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden functionalities, or suspicious network activity. The lack of obfuscated code, malicious pattern signatures, or unusual behaviors suggests this is likely benign. However, detailed assessment depends on the actual runtime data and environment, which are not provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static analysis of the code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a typical Python script with no suspicious patterns. Confidence is moderate due to lack of runtime context. No obfuscation or malware signals are detected.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
