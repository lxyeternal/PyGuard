      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a prompt template generator with no malicious payloads or external system interactions. The minor security concern relates to prompt injection, which is inherent in prompt-based systems but does not constitute malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which pose potential security risks but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate and conservative, accurately reflecting suspicion levels without overestimating threat. Continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm safety."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to the absence of input validation and potential for misuse, but these are typical for such internal or prototype tools. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for converting text into a PDF document. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, with a minor conservative adjustment to 0.1 in one report being unnecessary. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
