  "purpose": "Define prompts for LinkedIn post generation and provide functions to list and retrieve these prompts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function arguments, specifically 'arguments' dict in 'get_prompt'.",
  "sinks": "String formatting of user input into prompt messages, which could lead to injection if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('topic', 'lesson', 'project', 'description') flow into formatted text content for prompts, but only within controlled string templates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. The code relies on external libraries for message and prompt handling but does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of prompt templates and two async functions: one for listing prompts, another for retrieving a specific prompt with parameters. Input arguments are retrieved directly from 'arguments' dict, then interpolated into prompt messages. These inputs are used only to generate text content for prompts and do not involve executing or evaluating the input beyond string formatting. No external network calls, no code execution, no data leaks, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The use of string interpolation with user input in prompts might be a minor concern if the input is maliciously crafted, but since it is just used to generate text for prompts, it does not pose a direct security threat. The code does not contain any malicious behavior or backdoors. It appears to be a standard prompt management implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward prompt management module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only potential concern is the insertion of user input into text prompts, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, it is safe.",
