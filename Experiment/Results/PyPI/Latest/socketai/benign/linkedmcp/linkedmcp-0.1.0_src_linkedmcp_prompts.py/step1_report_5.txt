{
  "purpose": "The code defines prompt templates and functions to generate LinkedIn-related content based on user inputs.",
  "sources": "User-provided arguments in 'get_prompt' function (arguments parameter); imported modules and constants.",
  "sinks": "Construction of prompt messages using user inputs; potential string concatenation leading to untrusted content inclusion.",
  "flows": "User inputs (arguments) are retrieved in 'get_prompt' and inserted into prompt text, then returned as part of the message content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code dynamically inserts user data into prompt messages without sanitization, but this is standard for prompt generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a set of prompts. It provides asynchronous functions to list prompts and retrieve specific prompt details based on input arguments. User inputs are directly embedded into message contents, but this is typical for prompt generation and does not exhibit malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward prompt template generator for LinkedIn posts, with user inputs integrated into prompt messages. No malicious or security-compromising behaviors are evident. The only minor concern is the direct insertion of user input into message text, which could be exploited for unwanted content but is expected in prompt generation workflows.",
