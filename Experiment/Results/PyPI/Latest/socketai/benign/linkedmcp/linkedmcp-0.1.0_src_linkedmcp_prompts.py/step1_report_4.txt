{
  "purpose": "The code defines prompt templates and functions to retrieve prompts for generating LinkedIn-related posts, specifically for personal stories and launch announcements.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'arguments' dictionary provided to the 'get_prompt' function, which supplies user input such as 'topic', 'lesson', 'project', and 'description'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the constructed prompt content sent to the language model, which could be exploited if malicious input is injected to craft harmful prompts or execute unintended actions within the language model.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'arguments' flows into the prompt content construction, forming the user messages. The functions then return these messages encapsulated in 'GetPromptResult' objects. There are no further data flows outside this scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No unusual behavior, such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration detected. The code primarily constructs prompt messages based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The code securely constructs prompt messages based on user-supplied arguments, with standard validation and exception handling for missing prompts. It does not perform unsafe operations, nor does it include malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, with no evidence of malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for generating predefined prompts for a language model interface, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply formats user input into prompts and returns them, with proper validation. No malware or security issues identified.",
