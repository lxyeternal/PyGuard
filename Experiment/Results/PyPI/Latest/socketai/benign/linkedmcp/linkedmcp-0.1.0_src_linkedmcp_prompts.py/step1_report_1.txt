  "purpose": "This code defines a set of prompts for generating LinkedIn posts related to stories and launches, providing functions to list and retrieve these prompts.",
  "sources": "User-provided arguments in get_prompt function (arguments parameter), and imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "Generation of text prompts based on user inputs; no direct data leaks or external network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to construct prompt messages; no external or untrusted data flows outside the prompt construction logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code relies solely on provided arguments to generate text prompts without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines prompt templates for LinkedIn posts. It provides two async functions: one lists all prompts, and the other retrieves a specific prompt based on its name. When fetching prompts, it constructs message content dynamically from user-supplied arguments, which is typical for prompt generation. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or malicious behavior such as network communication, file access, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and handles errors appropriately. It appears to be intended for content generation and does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign prompt management module intended for generating LinkedIn posts. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
