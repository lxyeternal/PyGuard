  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds the code benign, straightforward, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is indeed simple prompt management; no network, no file access, no malicious payloads.  \n- The securityRisk is low, given no external interactions or data leaks.  \n- The malware score is correctly zero.  \n- Confidence is justified as the code is very clear.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slight concern about string interpolation of user input into prompts but concludes it's safe because it's just prompt content generation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly notes that user input is inserted into prompt messages.  \n- While this could be a vector for prompt injection if the language model is malicious, the code itself does not execute or evaluate user input beyond string formatting.  \n- The risk is minimal; no malicious code or external data flow.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, considering potential prompt injection in downstream systems but not in the code itself.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no malware, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, straightforward prompt template code, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code constructs prompts based on arguments; no external calls or code execution.  \n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- The securityRisk is zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code constructs prompts with user input, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Same reasoning applies; the code is a prompt template generator with safe behavior.  \n- No external interactions or malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that user input is inserted into prompts, which could be exploited for prompt injection but considers it normal for prompt generation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The concern about prompt injection is valid but not indicative of malicious code in the implementation.  \n- The score of 0.2 for securityRisk is reasonable, reflecting a minor potential risk if downstream systems process untrusted input maliciously.  \n- Malware remains zero, as there's no malicious payload or code execution.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware present. I agree with a malware score of **0** across all.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation; some reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, others 0.0. Given the code's nature, the only concern is prompt injection potential, which is minimal but worth noting. A score of **0.1 to 0.2** seems reasonable, with 0.2 being slightly cautious.\n\n- **Confidence:** Most reports have high confidence (1), except one at 0.9, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (minimal risk due to user input insertion into prompts, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward prompt management module with negligible security risks. The scores in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The slight variations in security risk scores are justified based on the potential for prompt injection, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1–0.2, reflecting the minimal prompt injection concern.",
