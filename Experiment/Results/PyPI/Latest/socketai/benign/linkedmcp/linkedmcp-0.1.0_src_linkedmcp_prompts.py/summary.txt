  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a prompt template generator with no malicious payloads or external system interactions. The minor security concern relates to prompt injection, which is inherent in prompt-based systems but does not constitute malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
