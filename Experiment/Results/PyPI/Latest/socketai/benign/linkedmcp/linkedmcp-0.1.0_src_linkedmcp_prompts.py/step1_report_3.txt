  "purpose": "This code defines prompt templates and functions to retrieve prompts for generating LinkedIn posts, specifically for stories and launch announcements.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'arguments' parameter in 'get_prompt', which is a dictionary of strings; also, 'name' parameter for selecting prompt types.",
  "sinks": "The constructed prompt messages containing user-provided input are the output, used in further processing or display. No data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are retrieved from 'arguments' dict, formatted into prompt messages, and returned as 'types.GetPromptResult'. No data flows to external systems or network calls within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines prompt templates and functions to fetch prompts based on the prompt name and arguments. It uses straightforward data handling with no external system calls, no user input beyond function arguments, and no suspicious code constructs. Error handling is limited to raising exceptions when prompts are not found. All input data are incorporated into prompt messages without modification or external influence. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for prompt management with no malicious intent. It safely constructs prompts based on user-supplied arguments for generating LinkedIn posts. No security risks or malware are identified.",
