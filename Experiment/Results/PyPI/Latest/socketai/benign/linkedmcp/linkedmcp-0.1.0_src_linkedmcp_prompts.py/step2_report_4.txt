  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as defining prompts and functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that no external data leaks or network calls are observed; input flows are limited to prompt message construction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The securityRisk is minimal, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate, and the low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to previous, noting input from 'arguments' and prompt templates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights string formatting of user input, which could be a concern if malicious input is crafted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code. The minor concern about string interpolation is acknowledged but deemed not dangerous.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious intent; confidence is high.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. This is slightly higher than Report 1, reflecting the potential for prompt injection or content manipulation.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. While prompt injection could be a concern, in this context, it doesn't constitute malicious behavior but warrants a slightly higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to previous, focusing on prompt retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes prompt message construction from user input, no external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low risk, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar prompt management code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern; user input forms prompt content.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; again, prompt templates with user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights potential for untrusted content inclusion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The direct insertion of user input into prompts is standard but could be exploited for prompt injection.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Recognizes the potential but considers it non-malicious. The minor security risk score reflects this.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; the minor concern about prompt injection is acknowledged but not deemed malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, mainly due to the potential for prompt injection or content manipulation via user inputs. Given the code's purpose (prompt generation), these are minor concerns and do not constitute actual vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk, mostly related to prompt injection potential)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a simple prompt management module.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is prompt injection, which is inherent in prompt-based systems but does not imply malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
