{
  "purpose": "Defines prompt templates and functions to list and retrieve prompts for generating LinkedIn posts.",
  "sources": "Arguments provided to functions (e.g., 'topic', 'lesson', 'project', 'description') used to construct prompt messages.",
  "sinks": "Prompt message content where user input is embedded into text strings for model prompts.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into prompt message content, which is then returned for use in language model interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines prompt templates and retrieval functions with no external system calls or data leaks. User inputs are incorporated into prompt texts via string formatting, which could be exploited for prompt injection but does not involve malicious code execution or external data flow. The code is simple, clear, and lacks obfuscation or malicious intent. The primary concern is prompt injection potential, which is a known risk in prompt engineering but not indicative of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1-0.2), reflecting prompt injection concerns but no actual malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a prompt template generator with no malicious payloads or external system interactions. The minor security concern relates to prompt injection, which is inherent in prompt-based systems but does not constitute malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
