{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the YouTube Data API to retrieve video snippets, statistics, and related videos, likely for content analysis or browsing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (video IDs, youtube API object) and performs HTTP HEAD requests to check if videos are Shorts via the requests library.",
  "sinks": "Uses the responses from YouTube API and requests to process video data; no output sinks indicate data leakage or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API calls and URL requests through function parameters into data processing, without evident untrusted data being used insecurely in code execution or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious URL manipulation, no use of eval or exec. The code uses standard API calls and HTTP requests; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard API interactions to fetch video and channel data from YouTube, along with a URL check to identify Shorts videos. It handles potential request exceptions gracefully. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The use of requests.head for URL checking is benign. No suspicious code patterns or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical YouTube data retrieval tasks with proper exception handling and no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script for content analysis. The overall security risk is low.",
