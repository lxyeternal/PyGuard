{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves video data, statistics, and nearby videos from YouTube using the YouTube Data API and requests.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include video IDs provided to functions; external data fetched via YouTube Data API requests and HTTP HEAD request to check for Shorts.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include the returned video data and statistics; no sensitive data is explicitly written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input video IDs flow into API request functions and the requests.head call; responses are processed to determine video properties and nearby videos.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL manipulations, or unusual code structures detected. The requests.head usage is standard for checking URL existence.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly interfaces with YouTube's API to gather video details and related videos, utilizing HTTP requests and JSON processing. It handles exceptions in the URL check. No suspicious code or backdoors are present. The logic appears standard for a video data aggregator. No data leakage or malicious network activity is evident. The use of requests.head is benign, simply checking URL existence.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard YouTube API data retrieval functions with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be legitimate application code with no security risks detected.",
