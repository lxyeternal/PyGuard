{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes a YouTube video's view count relative to similar videos by fetching nearby videos, sorting them, and displaying the data in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "Input: URL argument (parsed by parse_youtube_url); Data sources: initialize_youtube_client() for API access, find_nearby_videos() for fetching video data, and the provided video data itself.",
  "sinks": "Output: console.print() displays the resulting table; data processing functions like format_number, decode_html_entities, format_date, which handle video data and display info.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> parse_youtube_url -> initialize_youtube_client -> find_nearby_videos -> process and sort videos -> format data (view counts, titles, dates) -> display in console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network connections are visible. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is evident. Functions imported appear standard for such a task.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves user input (video URL), parses it, initializes a YouTube API client, fetches nearby videos, sorts and formats data for display. All data handling appears typical. No suspicious data leaks, network connections, or malicious code are present. The functions used (e.g., initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos) are assumed to perform standard API operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The only notable point is reliance on external functions, but their usage appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign operation of analyzing YouTube video statistics and displaying them. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code segment.",
