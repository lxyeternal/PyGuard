  "purpose": "Analyze a YouTube video's view count relative to similar videos by fetching data via API and displaying it in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "parse_youtube_url, initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos, decode_html_entities, format_number, format_date",
  "sinks": "console.print (displaying the table)",
  "flows": "Input URL -> parse_youtube_url -> initialize_youtube_client -> find_nearby_videos -> sort videos -> format data -> console.print",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data parsing, API initialization, data fetching, sorting, formatting, and display. It relies on external modules presumed safe. No network activity beyond API calls, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. External functions are assumed to perform standard, safe operations. The code does not write to disk or send data over the network beyond API interactions. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for analyzing YouTube videos. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by external API interactions but no vulnerabilities. The code's behavior is consistent with a safe utility.",
