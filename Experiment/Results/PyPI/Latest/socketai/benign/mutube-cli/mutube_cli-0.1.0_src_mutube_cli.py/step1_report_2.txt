  "purpose": "Analyze a YouTube video's view count relative to similar videos by fetching and displaying video data in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "Input URL argument; data retrieved via 'parse_youtube_url', 'find_nearby_videos', 'initialize_youtube_client', and data fields within 'videos' such as 'statistics' and 'snippet'.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the formatted table to console; potential formatting or display logic.",
  "flows": "Input URL parsed to extract video ID -> 'initialize_youtube_client' initializes YouTube API client -> 'find_nearby_videos' fetches video data -> data processed and sorted -> formatted into a table -> displayed on console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of external modules appears typical for a CLI video analysis tool. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts a video ID from a user-provided URL, initializes a YouTube API client, fetches nearby videos, sorts them by view count, and displays the results in a formatted table. The process involves standard data parsing, sorting, and formatting operations. No input/output channels seem to leak data or conduct malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity is present. The code relies on external libraries for display and data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for analyzing YouTube video statistics, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe based on this analysis.",
