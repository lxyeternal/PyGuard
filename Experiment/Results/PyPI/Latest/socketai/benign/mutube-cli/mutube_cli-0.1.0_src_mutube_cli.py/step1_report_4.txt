  "purpose": "Analyze a YouTube video's view count relative to similar videos and display results in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command line argument (URL), and data from the 'parse_youtube_url' and 'find_nearby_videos' functions.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via 'console.print'. No untrusted data is sent over network, stored, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> 'parse_youtube_url' -> 'find_nearby_videos' -> Data processing -> Output to console",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. External libraries used are standard and well-known.",
  "analysis": "The code parses a URL, initializes a YouTube client, retrieves related videos, and displays statistical data in a formatted table. It uses external functions for parsing URLs, formatting numbers, dates, and decoding HTML entities. No user data is stored or transmitted outside the local context. No suspicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The data processing appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign analysis and display of YouTube video data without any indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility script with no malicious or supply chain security issues.",
