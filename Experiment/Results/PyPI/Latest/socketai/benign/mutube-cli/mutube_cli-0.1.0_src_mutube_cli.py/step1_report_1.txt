{
  "purpose": "Analyze a YouTube video's view count relative to similar videos and display the information in a formatted table.",
  "sources": "URL input argument, parsing functions, external module functions (initialize_youtube_client, find_nearby_videos, parse_youtube_url, decode_html_entities, format_number, format_date).",
  "sinks": "None apparent—no direct output of untrusted data to network or files; data is only processed and displayed locally.",
  "flows": "URL input → parse_youtube_url → initialize_youtube_client → find_nearby_videos → data processing (sorting, formatting) → console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Usage of external modules appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes a provided YouTube URL or ID, calls a presumed safe API initialization, retrieves nearby videos, sorts and formats their data, and displays the results in a table. All external modules seem intended for standard data processing and presentation. No hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious data handling are evident. The code relies on imported functions for parsing and formatting, with no embedded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward data analysis and display task with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
