  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for analyzing YouTube videos. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by external API interactions but no vulnerabilities. The code's behavior is consistent with a safe utility."
