  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a CLI utility that takes a YouTube URL, extracts the video ID, initializes a YouTube API client, fetches related videos, sorts, formats, and displays them.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- External modules and functions are standard for such tasks.\n- No network activity beyond API calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; straightforward data analysis and display.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to above; safe, standard processing.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n  - confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). Given no suspicious activity, this seems conservative but acceptable. No reason to increase malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n  - confidence: 0.95\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same benign pattern.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n  - confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same benign analysis.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n  - confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are conservative and acceptable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence scores:** Appropriately high, reflecting the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — a very low risk, considering the code's benign nature, external dependencies, and no hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, safe utility with minimal security concern.",
