  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY') retrieves the API key from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() uses the API key to create the client, which could potentially be misused if the key is compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'YOUTUBE_API_KEY' flows into the discovery.build() function as an API key parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code disables HTTPS verification with OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT='1', which is insecure and should only be used in local testing. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, disables HTTPS verification for OAuthlib (which is insecure for production), and constructs a YouTube API client with a developer key retrieved from environment variables. The environment variable is appropriately used, and no malicious behavior is evident. The disabling of HTTPS verification is a security risk but not malicious per se; it is typical for local testing. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for accessing YouTube API with environment-based credentials. No malicious behavior or malware is present. The insecure setting for OAuthlib is a security concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is low risk.",
