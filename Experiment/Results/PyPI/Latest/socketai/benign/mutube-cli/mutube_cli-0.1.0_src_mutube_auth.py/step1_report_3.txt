  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using credentials loaded from environment variables.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY') reads the API key from environment variables; load_dotenv() loads environment variables from a file.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() uses the API key, potentially leading to unauthorized API access if the key is compromised.",
  "flows": "YOUTUBE_API_KEY from environment variables flows into discovery.build() as a credential for API access.",
  "anomalies": "Explicitly setting OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1 disables HTTPS verification, which is insecure and may facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks during local testing.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables from a .env file, then sets an environment variable to disable HTTPS verification, which is insecure outside of testing environments. It then constructs a YouTube API client using a developer API key fetched from environment variables. The practice of disabling HTTPS verification is risky if used in production. The use of environment variables for API keys is standard, but the insecure transport setting is a potential security concern during local development. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The code's primary risk is the insecure setting for HTTPS verification, which could be exploited if used improperly in production.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard API client initialization with environment variables but includes an insecure setting that should only be used during local testing. No malicious behavior detected, but the insecure transport configuration poses a security risk if misused.",
