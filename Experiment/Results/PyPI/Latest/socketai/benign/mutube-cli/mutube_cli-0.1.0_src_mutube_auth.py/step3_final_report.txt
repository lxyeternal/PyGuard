  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using environment variables, with insecure HTTPS verification disabled for local testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'YOUTUBE_API_KEY' via os.getenv(), load_dotenv() loading env variables, setting 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' to '1'.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() using the API key, environment variable access, setting environment variable for insecure transport.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() -> os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY') -> discovery.build() with API key; setting 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' -> disables HTTPS verification during API client setup.",
  "anomalies": "Insecure HTTPS verification disabled via 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1', explicitly for local testing; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, retrieves the API key, and initializes a YouTube client. The insecure setting disables HTTPS verification, which is acceptable only in local testing environments. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the explicit comments and typical development practices. The main concern is the insecure transport setting, which should be removed or conditioned in production environments. Overall, the code is legitimate and safe for local testing, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for initializing a YouTube API client, with a known development-only insecure setting. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score is appropriate given the insecure HTTPS verification, which should be disabled in production. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
