  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using API key loaded from environment variables.",
  "sources": "load_dotenv() reads environment variables from a .env file; os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY') retrieves the API key.",
  "sinks": "discovery.build() uses the API key to create a YouTube client object.",
  "flows": "load_dotenv() -> os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY') -> discovery.build() with API key.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' to '1', disabling HTTPS verification, which is insecure for production; use only locally. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables via dotenv, retrieves the YouTube API key securely from environment variables, and constructs a YouTube client object with it. The setting of 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' to '1' is insecure but explicitly documented as for local testing, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API access.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for legitimate API client initialization, with no malicious intent. The only concern is the insecure setting for HTTPS verification, which should be avoided in production but is clearly labeled as for local use. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
