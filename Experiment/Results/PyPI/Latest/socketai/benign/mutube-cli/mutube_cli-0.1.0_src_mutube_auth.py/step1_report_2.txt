  "purpose": "Initialize a YouTube API client using credentials stored in environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'YOUTUBE_API_KEY' for API key.",
  "sinks": "Uses the API key in the discovery.build() function to create a YouTube client.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'YOUTUBE_API_KEY' -> discovery.build() for API client creation.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling HTTPS verification via 'OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT' in a local environment is present but explicitly marked as insecure for local use only; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, disables HTTPS verification (not recommended for production), and constructs a YouTube API client using an API key fetched from environment variables. The use of 'dotenv' for environment management is common, and the setting for insecure transport is explicitly noted as for local testing. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data flow, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to initialize a YouTube API client securely, with explicit comments about insecure settings used only locally. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior observed.",
