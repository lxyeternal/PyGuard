  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code consists of utility functions: XML to JSON parsing, number formatting, HTML entity decoding, date formatting, and YouTube URL parsing.\n- The functions operate on input parameters, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n- The parse_youtube_url function only extracts video IDs based on URL patterns; it raises exceptions on unexpected formats.\n- The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Benign utility functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions, likely for larger application.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No network or malicious activity; processing is safe.\n- **Score justification:** The low security risk score is acceptable; no reason to increase.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same utility functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe processing.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, with input URLs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; functions are safe.\n- **Score justification:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, with URL processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; straightforward logic.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the functions' nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1) is justified due to potential exception raising in URL parsing, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The exception raising in `parse_youtube_url` is standard error handling, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration.\n- The functions are utility in nature, with no external side effects.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n**The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n## **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to exception handling in URL parsing, which is standard)\n\n**Final judgment:** The code is safe, benign, and free of security risks based on the provided implementation.",
