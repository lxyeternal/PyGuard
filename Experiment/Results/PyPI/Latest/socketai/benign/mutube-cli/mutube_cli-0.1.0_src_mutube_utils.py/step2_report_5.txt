  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The functions are utility in nature, with inputs from parameters; no external data or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The URL parsing only extracts IDs, raising exceptions on unexpected formats.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, with a confidence of 1, malware score 0, and security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with data processed internally.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no external calls, or malicious activity. The only minor point is the exception handling in URL parsing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with a confidence of 0.9, malware 0, and security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The security risk score is low but slightly above zero, which is acceptable given the exception handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, straightforward data parsing and formatting.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no external network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with a confidence of 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions with input data from predefined URLs.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; the URL parsing raises exceptions on unexpected formats, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.95), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same utility functions, with no external data flow beyond URL parsing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that there are no malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation in the code.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  - Malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the lack of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n  - Security risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern due to exception handling but no actual risk.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the code's benign nature, straightforward utility functions, and consistent reasoning in all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (since the only minor concern is exception handling, but no real risk)\n\n**Additional note:** The malware score should remain at 0 because there's no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type          | Final Value | Justification                                               |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware             | 0            | No malicious activity detected                               |\n| Obfuscated          | 0            | Code is clear, no obfuscation                                |\n| Security Risk       | 0.1          | Minor concern due to exception handling, but no real risk   |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores are appropriately low.",
