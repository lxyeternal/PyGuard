  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward utility functions; no malicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are standard data processing routines with no external or malicious activity. Slightly higher confidence (0.9), but no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity. The code handles inputs safely, raises exceptions on invalid URLs, and performs no network or unsafe operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—benign utility functions, no suspicious behaviors, no external data flows or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriately low risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others; no malicious or obfuscated code, no suspicious external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware, which aligns with the code's behavior—simple data processing functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for security issues due to input handling (e.g., exception raising in URL parsing). No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- The URL parsing is safe, with exception handling for malformed URLs.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The functions serve legitimate purposes and are implemented with standard practices.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with minimal inherent risk due to input handling)  \n\n**Additional note:** No changes needed; the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, primarily related to malformed input handling, which is already managed. The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the overall risk score should stay at 0.1 for conservative safety assessment.",
