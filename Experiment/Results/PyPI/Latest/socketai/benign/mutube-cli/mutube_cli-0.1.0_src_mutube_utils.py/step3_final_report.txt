  "purpose": "Utility functions for XML to JSON conversion, number formatting, HTML entity decoding, date formatting, and extracting YouTube video IDs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate on provided inputs without external or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parsing and formatting functions; no external sinks or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; exception handling in URL parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions with no network activity, malicious code, or obfuscation. The URL parsing function raises exceptions on invalid formats, which is standard error handling. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes and are implemented with standard practices. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1) justified by minimal exception handling concerns. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
