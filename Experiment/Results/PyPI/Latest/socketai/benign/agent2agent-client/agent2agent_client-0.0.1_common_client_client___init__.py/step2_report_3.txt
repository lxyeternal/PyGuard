  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as importing two classes from local modules (.client and .card_resolver) and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- The code snippets are minimal, with no data processing, network operations, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected across all reports.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code. They all agree that the code is straightforward and standard for module exports.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, security flaws, or code mistakes are reported or evident.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware` score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - `obfuscated` is 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n  - `securityRisk` is 0 or very close to 0, reflecting no evident security concerns.\n  - `confidence` is high, indicating strong certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is very simple: just import and export class names.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, the code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, the code's purpose is purely organizational, with no security implications.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The code is standard module export boilerplate with no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
