{
  "purpose": "Exports classes A2AClient and A2ACardResolver for external use, likely part of a larger module related to payment or authentication services.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.client and .card_resolver).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only exports imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no data processing, input handling, or external network interactions. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. It appears to be standard module export code.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple, benign module export statement with no malicious or security concerns. It functions as a standard part of a Python package, exposing specific classes for external use.",
