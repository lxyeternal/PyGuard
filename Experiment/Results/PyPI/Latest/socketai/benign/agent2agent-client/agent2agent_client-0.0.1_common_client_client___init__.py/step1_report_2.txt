{
  "purpose": "The code exports two classes, A2AClient and A2ACardResolver, likely for use in a larger application related to some form of client-server or card resolution functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client and .card_resolver",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted input handling occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code simply imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks within this snippet. The structure suggests standard module initialization, with no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or security issues. The code appears typical for Python package exports, with no anomalies or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module exporting classes for external use, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided snippet.",
