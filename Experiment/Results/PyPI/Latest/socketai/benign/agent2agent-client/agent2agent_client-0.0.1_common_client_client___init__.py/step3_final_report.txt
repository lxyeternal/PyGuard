{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or untrusted data; it only imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, as the code does not process data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply defines exports without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that imports two classes and defines __all__ for export. It contains no network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks is consistent with the code's simplicity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting no threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module export pattern with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
