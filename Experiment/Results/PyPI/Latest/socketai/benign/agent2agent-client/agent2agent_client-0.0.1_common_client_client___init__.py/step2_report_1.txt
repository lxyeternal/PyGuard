  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing two classes from local modules and defining `__all__`.\n- No data flows, no network activity, no untrusted input handling, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The code is very minimal and standard for module exports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is benign; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward module export pattern.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- No factual errors are evident; all reports correctly interpret the code.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound: the code is simple, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, also correct.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which seems slightly high but still minimal; the reasoning is that the code could be part of a larger system, but given the snippet, the risk remains negligible.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No evidence suggests any risk; even the report with 0.1 security risk score does so based on the possibility of being part of a larger system, but this is speculative.\n- Malware scores are correctly zero, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- The minimal scores reflect the lack of any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard module export pattern with no security issues.\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0** (or very close to zero)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard Python module export pattern with no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
