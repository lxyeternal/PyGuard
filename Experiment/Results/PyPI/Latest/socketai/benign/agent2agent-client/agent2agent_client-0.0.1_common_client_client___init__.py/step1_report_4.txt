{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for classes A2AClient and A2ACardResolver, likely part of a larger package related to payment or authorization processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client and .card_resolver",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or sinks are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling beyond importing and exporting classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two classes from local modules and declares them as exports. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior or unusual activities. The minimal nature of the code limits the possibility of embedded malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious or security risk indicators. It functions as a part of a package's public API definition.",
