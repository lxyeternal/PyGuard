{
  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing and retrieving data with optional TTL (time-to-live).",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as key, value, and ttl in set() method; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs through get() and delete() methods; cache data is stored in internal dictionaries. No external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (key, value, ttl) flow into set(); key-based retrieval flows from get(); deletions flow from delete(); clearing flow from clear(). No external data flows to network or filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code uses standard thread-safe singleton pattern and cache management. No suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network calls, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard thread-safe singleton pattern with typical cache operations (set, get, delete, clear). It manages TTL for cache entries with time checks and handles concurrency via locks. There are no external network calls, file operations, or suspicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a clean, well-structured in-memory cache utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard in-memory cache implementation with thread safety and TTL support. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
