  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing and retrieving data with optional expiration.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters: 'set' method for key, value, and ttl; 'get' method for key; no external data sources outside method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored internally in a dictionary; no external output or data exfiltration points present; cache data can be retrieved via 'get'.",
  "flows": "Data flow from 'set' input parameters to internal storage; 'get' retrieves data; TTL expiration triggers deletion; no external data leaks or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network or file system operations, no suspicious data handling. Code implements standard thread-safe cache logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class for caching data in memory, with thread safety and TTL support. Methods are standard for cache management. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. No external network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs observed. It appears to be a typical utility class intended for performance or resource management within an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard in-memory cache utility with thread safety and TTL features. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It functions as intended without any security concerns.",
