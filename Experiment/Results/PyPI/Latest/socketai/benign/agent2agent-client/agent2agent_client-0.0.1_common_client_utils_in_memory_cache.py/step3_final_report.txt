{
  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache with TTL support for storing key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "Data is set via the set() method; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored internally; no external sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from set() to internal storage; get() retrieves data; TTL expiration is checked during get().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard thread-safe singleton pattern with double-checked locking, manages cache data with TTL, and ensures thread safety via locks. No external data or network activity occurs. The logic is straightforward, with proper expiration handling and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is well-structured and aligns with typical cache utilities, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented in-memory cache utility with thread safety and TTL support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a security risk score of 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
