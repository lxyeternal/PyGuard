{
  "purpose": "The code implements a thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing key-value pairs with optional TTL (time-to-live).",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method arguments such as 'key', 'value', and 'ttl' in 'set' method, and 'key' in 'get', 'delete', and 'clear' methods.",
  "sinks": "The data stored in the cache can be retrieved via 'get', 'set' adds or updates entries, 'delete' removes entries, and 'clear' wipes all data. No external sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input sources include method parameters; data flows from 'set' to '_cache_data' and '_ttl'; 'get' reads from '_cache_data' and '_ttl' to verify expiration; 'delete' removes keys from the internal dictionaries; 'clear' wipes all data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code strictly manages in-memory data with thread safety. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The class employs a standard singleton pattern with double-checked locking for thread safety. It manages a cache with optional TTL for each key. The 'set' method updates in-memory dictionaries; 'get' checks expiration and retrieves data; 'delete' removes specific keys; 'clear' wipes all data. No external network access, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present. The implementation appears straightforward, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard thread-safe in-memory cache implementation with TTL support. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a safe utility class suitable for use in larger applications.",
