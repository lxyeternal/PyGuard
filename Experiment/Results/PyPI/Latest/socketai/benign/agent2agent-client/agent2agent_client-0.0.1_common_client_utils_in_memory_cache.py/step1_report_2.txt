{
  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing key-value data with optional TTL (time-to-live).",
  "sources": "None explicitly read from external sources; data is stored internally via set() method.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in internal dictionaries; no external sinks or network communications present.",
  "flows": "Data is set via set() and retrieved via get(), with TTL expiration handled internally. No external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors. Methods and data structures are standard for an in-memory cache.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern to manage cache data safely across threads, using locks to prevent race conditions. The set(), get(), delete(), and clear() methods perform standard cache operations. TTL handling is straightforward, removing expired items on access. No external input/output, network communication, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be a normal cache utility with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical in-memory cache utility with thread safety and TTL management. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected.",
