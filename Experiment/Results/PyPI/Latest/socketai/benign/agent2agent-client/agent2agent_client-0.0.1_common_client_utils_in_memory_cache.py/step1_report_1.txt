{
  "purpose": "A thread-safe singleton in-memory cache utility for storing, retrieving, and deleting data with optional TTL support.",
  "sources": "Code reads input via method arguments (set, get, delete). No external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in _cache_data and _ttl dictionaries. No external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through set, get, and delete methods into internal dictionaries; no external outputs or network actions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No external network calls or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a cache utility.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern with thread safety, storing cache data in dictionaries with optional TTL expiration. The get method correctly removes expired data. Methods are standard for cache management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The absence of network communication, secret handling, or suspicious logic indicates a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured in-memory cache utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within the local process memory, with standard thread-safe design patterns. No malware or security issues are detected.",
