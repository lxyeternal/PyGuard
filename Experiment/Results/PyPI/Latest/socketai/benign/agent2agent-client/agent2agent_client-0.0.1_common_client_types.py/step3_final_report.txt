  "purpose": "Data models and schemas for task management, messaging, error handling, and RPC communication.",
  "sources": "Schema definitions, data validation methods, UUID generation, timestamp fields, credential and URL fields.",
  "sinks": "Potential external data inputs such as URLs, credentials, tokens, and IDs.",
  "flows": "Data input via schema fields (e.g., credentials, URLs) that could be misused if supplied maliciously, but no active data flow or code execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Permissive 'extra=\"allow\"' in AuthenticationInfo is standard but could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data models, enums, and error classes used for task and RPC management. Validation methods are straightforward, UUIDs and timestamps are standard. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The presence of URLs and credentials fields is typical for such schemas but could be exploited if malicious data is supplied externally. The overall structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured schema definitions with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minimal security risk stems from potential misuse of external data fields, but the code itself is safe.",
