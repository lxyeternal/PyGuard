  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code manages push notification auth via JWTs, with key generation, verification, and URL validation. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n  - The low security risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n  - Malware score is appropriately zero.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on URL validation and JWT handling. No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The URL validation step is unconventional but not malicious.\n  - The code's cryptographic practices are sound.\n  - Scores are consistent.\n- **Verdict**: Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, standard JWT-based push notification system with proper key management and validation.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No signs of malicious behavior.\n  - The code's logic is sound.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Standard JWT and JWK handling, with URL validation and payload integrity checks.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No malicious activity.\n  - External JWKS fetching is typical, not suspicious.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, with proper JWT handling and validation.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No malicious signs.\n  - The code appears secure.\n- **Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior in the code.\n- **Obfuscated**: All 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk**: 0.2 across all reports indicates minimal risk, which is reasonable given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- The code is well-implemented, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if considering potential external dependencies or network interactions, but given the current code, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n- The malware score should stay at 0; no signs of malicious activity are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of push notification JWT handling with no malicious intent.",
