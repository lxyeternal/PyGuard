{
  "purpose": "The code implements a push notification authentication system using JWTs signed with RSA keys, including key management, URL validation, and payload integrity checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from request bodies, headers, and external URLs (JWKS endpoint, validation URL).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into JWT verification, URL validation responses, and HTTP request responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (request body, headers) is hashed and signed; JWT tokens are generated and verified; URL validation involves GET requests with UUID tokens; tokens are checked for freshness and payload integrity.",
  "anomalies": "The URL validation method expects an exact UUID match in response, which is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices, generates RSA keys at runtime, manages JWKS, and validates tokens with timestamp and payload hash. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. External dependencies are used appropriately. The URL validation method, while unusual, does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 is justified by typical network and cryptographic considerations. The malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are consistent with the code's clarity and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented push notification authentication system following best practices. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk score accurately reflects standard security considerations.",
