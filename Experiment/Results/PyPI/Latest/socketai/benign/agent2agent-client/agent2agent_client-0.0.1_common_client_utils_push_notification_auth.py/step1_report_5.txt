{
  "purpose": "This code manages push notification authentication, including generating and verifying JWTs, handling JWKS endpoints, and verifying push notification requests.",
  "sources": "Input sources include: 'request' headers for authorization tokens, URL parameters in verify_push_notification_url, request body data in _calculate_request_body_sha256, and external JWKS endpoint URL.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: sending HTTP requests with tokens in send_push_notification, and returning public keys via JSONResponse in handle_jwks_endpoint.",
  "flows": "Flow involves generating a JWT with a request body hash and timestamp, then sending it as an Authorization header in push notifications; verification involves decoding JWT, matching request body hash, and timestamp checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. The code appears standard for JWT-based push notification auth. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution found. Logging is present but not suspicious. No signs of data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT signing and verification, with SHA256 hashing of request bodies to prevent tampering and replay attacks. It uses external libraries for cryptography and HTTP requests appropriately. The verification process checks token expiration and payload integrity, adhering to security best practices. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or credential leaks are evident. No unusual or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears designed for secure push notification handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, seemingly secure implementation for push notification authentication using JWTs, with appropriate request validation, token signing, and verification procedures. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
