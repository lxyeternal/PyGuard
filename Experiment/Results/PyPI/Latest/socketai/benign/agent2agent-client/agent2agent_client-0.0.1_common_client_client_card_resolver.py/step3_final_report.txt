  "purpose": "Fetches a JSON agent card from a constructed URL and parses it into an AgentCard object.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to self.base_url + self.agent_card_path, response.json() for JSON data",
  "sinks": "Parsing JSON into AgentCard, potential downstream processing of untrusted data",
  "flows": "Response from HTTP GET -> response.json() -> AgentCard(**response.json())",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URL manipulations; standard error handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward network request to retrieve JSON data and parse it into a data class. It uses proper URL construction, error handling for HTTP errors and JSON decoding, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The risk of malicious behavior is minimal, limited to the inherent risk of fetching untrusted data. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for fetching and parsing JSON data over HTTP. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The low security risk reflects the network dependency but does not indicate any specific vulnerabilities.",
