  "purpose": "Retrieve an agent card JSON from a specified URL, parse it into an AgentCard object.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to the constructed URL based on base_url and agent_card_path",
  "sinks": "response.json() parsing into AgentCard, response.raise_for_status() which could expose details on failure",
  "flows": "HTTP response data is fetched, checked for errors, then parsed into a data structure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward request and parse logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to fetch a JSON document and parse it into a data class. It uses a user-provided base_url, which is sanitized to prevent URL concatenation issues. The response is validated with raise_for_status() to ensure success. The JSON parsing is straightforward, with error handling for JSON decode errors. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on external libraries but does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple, safe HTTP client for retrieving and parsing a JSON resource. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and it appears to be a standard implementation for fetching configuration or metadata.",
