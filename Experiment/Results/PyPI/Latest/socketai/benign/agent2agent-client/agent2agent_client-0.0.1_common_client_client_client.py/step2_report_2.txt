  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard asynchronous Python client for HTTP and SSE, managing tasks and notifications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs are present.\n- Uses well-known libraries (`httpx`, `httpx_sse`) appropriately.\n- Error handling for JSON and HTTP errors is implemented.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on external inputs (payloads) without validation, but this is typical for such clients.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes standard request/response flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions `connect_sse` usage, which is normal.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; standard usage.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The reasoning is sound. The risk score is justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious URLs or credentials.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The low risk score is justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning and scores are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting low security risk, which is justified given the code's straightforward, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately score the security aspects. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the risk scores are justified.",
