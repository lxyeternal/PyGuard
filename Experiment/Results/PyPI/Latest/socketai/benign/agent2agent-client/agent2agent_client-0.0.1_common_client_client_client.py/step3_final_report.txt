{
  "purpose": "A Python async client for managing tasks via HTTP and SSE, including sending, receiving, and controlling tasks and notifications.",
  "sources": "Payloads from function parameters, response JSON data from HTTP requests, SSE event data streams.",
  "sinks": "Response handling and data parsing; no untrusted data directly affecting system state beyond network communication.",
  "flows": "Payloads are serialized and sent via HTTP POST or SSE; responses are parsed and returned as structured objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs; no obfuscated code; minor missing timeout in connect_sse (not security-related).",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured async client using standard libraries for HTTP and SSE communication. It handles errors appropriately, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the lack of a timeout parameter in the connect_sse call, which could lead to hanging connections but does not pose a security threat. Payloads are sent directly without validation, which is typical for such clients but could be improved for robustness. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate functionality with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard async task management client with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.2) is justified. Minor robustness improvements could be made by adding a timeout to the SSE connection, but this does not impact security.",
