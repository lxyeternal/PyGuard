  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard async task management client with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.2) is justified. Minor robustness improvements could be made by adding a timeout to the SSE connection, but this does not impact security."
