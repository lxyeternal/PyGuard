  "purpose": "Analyze the open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on dynamic features, data flows, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, or untrusted sources; code execution functions like eval/exec; network or file system operations.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network transmissions, file writes, or environment variable access that could leak data or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through potentially unsafe functions (eval/exec) to sinks like system commands or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without validation, high obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, suspicious variable names, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with potential data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The suspicion is supported by high obfuscation scores (around 0.75) and moderate malware likelihood (around 0.6). The absence of concrete malicious payloads keeps the malware score below 1. The code's structure and patterns justify a high security risk score (~0.65), emphasizing caution. The lack of code in some reports results in zero scores, which is appropriate. Overall, the analysis indicates potential obfuscation and dynamic behavior but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate security concerns. While no definitive malicious payloads are identified, the suspicious patterns justify elevated risk and obfuscation scores. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the available information.",
