  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for encryption, decryption, commitment generation, and latest Drand round retrieval, facilitating cryptographic operations and network data handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing data inputs; external functions (_get_encrypted_commit, _encrypt, _decrypt, etc.) invoked as sinks.",
  "sinks": "External cryptographic and network functions where data is processed or transmitted; no internal data manipulation or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into external functions for encryption/decryption or commitment creation; no internal data flow anomalies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors identified; code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple wrapper functions around external cryptographic and network data retrieval functions. It does not contain internal logic that could be malicious or flawed. All functions delegate to imported functions without additional processing, validation, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to facilitate cryptographic commitments and data retrieval from the Drand network. Given the lack of internal suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation, and assuming the external functions are secure, the code appears benign. The security risk primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the external library, which is outside the scope of this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent wrapper around cryptographic and network functions, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The overall security posture relies on the external functions' integrity, but the wrapper itself is safe and straightforward.",
