  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements, data input points, environment variables, network operations, data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, files) via code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence. Reports 1, 2, and 5 describe benign code with standard patterns, no suspicious activity, and low confidence due to limited context. Reports 3 and 4 lack code entirely, making analysis impossible but no suspicion is implied. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk is present across all reports. The reasoning aligns with the scores, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and descriptions are benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the limited context. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the provided information.",
