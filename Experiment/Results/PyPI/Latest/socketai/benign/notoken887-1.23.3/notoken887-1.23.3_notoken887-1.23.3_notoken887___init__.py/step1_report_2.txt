  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some functionality that involves importing modules, possibly related to data processing or network operations, but the exact purpose cannot be determined from the snippet provided due to its minimal content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or external inputs if present, though no explicit input sources are visible in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any network operations, file writes, or system calls that may process data from untrusted sources, but no such operations are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no observable data flows from sources to sinks in the provided snippet; the minimal code does not show data processing or transmission paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns in the snippet provided. The code appears to be a standard minimal import structure.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and only contains import statements with no further logic, data handling, or system interaction observed. Without additional code, there is no indication of malicious activity or security risks. The structure does not suggest obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign, and there are no suspicious patterns or actions detected.",
