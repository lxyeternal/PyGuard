{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python library 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, Python version requirements).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not handle or execute untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only sets static metadata without data flows or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code appears standard for a setup script. The author email and URL are potentially suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious code behavior is present. The author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' are unconventional and possibly malicious in intent but do not constitute active malicious code or behavior. The package description indicates testing obfuscation, but the script itself is standard and static.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no active malicious code. The only concern is potentially inappropriate contact information and URL, which may be indicative of malicious intent or trolling but not actual malware or security risk in the code itself.",
