  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; metadata anomalies are suspicious but do not indicate malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The primary concern is the metadata, which should be reviewed further if the package is distributed, but the code itself is safe."
