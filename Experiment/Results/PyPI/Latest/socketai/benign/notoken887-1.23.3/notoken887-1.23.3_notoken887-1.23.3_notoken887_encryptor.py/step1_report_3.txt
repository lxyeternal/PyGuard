{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) strings by replacing characters with specific Unicode symbols and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings via the 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods with the parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements where transformed strings are output. However, these do not lead to external data leakage or system modification directly.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential character replacements for encoding and decoding, transforming data within the program without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive character replacements but contains no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible character substitution cipher, replacing alphanumeric characters with specific Unicode symbols and vice versa. The approach is straightforward and static, with no dynamic data handling, external inputs beyond method parameters, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are evident. The code appears to serve as a simple obfuscation or encoding mechanism rather than malicious malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic character substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to transform text for obfuscation purposes. No malware or security threats are identified.",
