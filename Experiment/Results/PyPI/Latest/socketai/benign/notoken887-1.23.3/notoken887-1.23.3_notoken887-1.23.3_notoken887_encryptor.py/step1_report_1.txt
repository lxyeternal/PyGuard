{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher to encode and decode strings using a predefined character mapping.",
  "sources": "The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods read the input strings 'string' and 'encrypted_token', respectively.",
  "sinks": "The code performs replacements within strings; no direct data leaks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the parameters to the replacement operations within 'encrypt' and 'decrypt', with mappings converting characters back and forth.",
  "anomalies": "The substitution mappings are extensive but straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. No external network or file system operations are observed. No obfuscated or dynamic code features. The only notable aspect is the use of character replacement as a simple cipher, which is weak for security but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic substitution cipher with explicit mappings for alphanumeric characters and some special symbols. The 'encrypt' method replaces each character in the input with a corresponding symbol, while 'decrypt' reverses this process. The mapping appears static and fixed, with no external dependencies, no input validation, and no malicious functions or network operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels. The code's security is minimal, but it does not contain malicious behavior. It is a straightforward character substitution implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static substitution cipher without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It neither leaks data nor performs any harmful operations. The only concern is its weak security, but that is unrelated to malicious activity. Overall, it is benign and does not pose a security risk.",
