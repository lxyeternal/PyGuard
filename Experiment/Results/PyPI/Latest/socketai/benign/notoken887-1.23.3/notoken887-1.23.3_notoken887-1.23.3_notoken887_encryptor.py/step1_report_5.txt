{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using symbol mappings.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to encrypt() and encrypted strings passed to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; there are no direct sinks like file writing, network communication, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input string → encrypt/decrypt transformation → output string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely performing substitution cipher encoding/decoding without any obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It does not handle or access sensitive data, nor does it perform network or system operations.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward substitution cipher, replacing alphanumeric characters with Unicode symbols during encryption and reversing that process during decryption. The implementation relies on chained string replacements, which are computationally inefficient but functionally correct for simple encoding purposes. There are no external data sources, no side-effects, and no network or file operations. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static and self-contained, with no indications of malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic implementation of a substitution cipher for obfuscation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and does not pose a security threat.",
