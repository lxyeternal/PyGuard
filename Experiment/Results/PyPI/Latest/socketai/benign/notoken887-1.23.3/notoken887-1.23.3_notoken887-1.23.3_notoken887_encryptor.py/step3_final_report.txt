{
  "purpose": "The code implements a static character-based substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into replace chain in encrypt(), output flows out; similarly for decrypt() with reverse replacements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, repetitive string replacements without obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, static substitution cipher with predefined mappings for characters. It does not involve external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscated code. The encryption and decryption are symmetric and rely solely on chained string replacements. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The cipher's weakness is acknowledged, but it does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the weak security but benign nature. The code's structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static substitution cipher with no malicious intent or activity. It is not obfuscated and does not pose security threats beyond its cryptographic weakness. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
