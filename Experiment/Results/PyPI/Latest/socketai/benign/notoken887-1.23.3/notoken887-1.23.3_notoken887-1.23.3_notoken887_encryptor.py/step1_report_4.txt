{
  "purpose": "The class provides a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings using a predefined set of symbol replacements.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encrypt() and encrypted tokens provided to decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods perform string replacements; no external data sinks, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into encrypt() or decrypt(), undergo multiple replacements, and output the transformed string.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive chained string replacements for substitution ciphering. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or external dependencies are present. The implementation is purely symmetric substitution with no obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward substitution cipher, replacing characters with symbols in the encrypt() method and reversing in decrypt(). The substitution mappings are static and hardcoded. No external inputs, network communications, or system interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscated or complex logic. The substitution cipher itself is weak cryptographically but not malicious. The design appears to be for obfuscation or simple encoding, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic character substitution cipher without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The implementation is straightforward and static. No suspicious activities or security threats are detected.",
