  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Dynamic evaluation functions ('eval', 'exec'), obfuscated code segments, input/output operations, network or file access points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, or sensitive data handling functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated or dynamic code leading to execution paths that could affect system or data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, complex expressions, dynamic code execution, inconsistent variable naming, or hidden code segments.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate low to moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. No concrete malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed. Scores for malware remain low (~0.2), with obfuscation scores varying based on suspicion levels. Risk scores are moderate (~0.3-0.4), reflecting caution but no confirmed threats. The reasoning in each report aligns with the evidence, and scores are consistent with the described code behaviors. No significant anomalies or contradictions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that warrant cautious monitoring but lacks definitive evidence of malicious activity. The current scoring system appropriately reflects these findings, with low malware scores and variable obfuscation and risk scores. Continued analysis, especially de-obfuscation and behavioral monitoring, is recommended to confirm or dismiss potential threats.",
