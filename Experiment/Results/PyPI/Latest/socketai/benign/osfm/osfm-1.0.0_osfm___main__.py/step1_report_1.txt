{
  "purpose": "This script initializes a Qt application that can run either as a server or as a client, depending on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, os.path.dirname(__file__) for base path, imported functions from osfm modules for server check and setup.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() which terminates the application, and potentially functions like enable_rdp() and main_client() which may invoke system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--server' leads to server initialization, involving ensure_temp_folder_shared() and Server() instantiation; otherwise, enable_rdp() and main_client() are called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic detected. Use of os and subprocess is standard; no malicious activity apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment setup and process control based on command-line input. Functions like ensure_temp_folder_shared() and enable_rdp() are invoked, which could involve network or system operations but are imported from trusted modules. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. No data leaks or malicious code injection observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a client-server application setup, with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
