  "purpose": "This script initializes and runs either a server or client component of an application based on command-line arguments, primarily for remote desktop functionality and server management.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), os.path (reads directory information), imported functions from osfm.utils, osfm.server, osfm.clientfunc, osfm.client (likely internal functions), and imports from external libraries (PyQt5).",
  "sinks": "sys.argv (potentially influencing application flow), ensure_temp_folder_shared (filesystem operation), Server() instantiation, enable_rdp() function, main_client() function, sys.exit() call.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument checks determine whether to start a server or client. If server mode, checks for existing server, shares temp folder, and initiates server. If client mode, enables RDP and runs main client logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of standard libraries and internal functions appears normal. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward entry point for an application managing server/client modes, with conditional logic based on command-line input. It shares a temporary folder if starting a server, which could be a security concern if misused, but this is typical in remote or server applications. The functions invoked ('is_server_running', 'ensure_temp_folder_shared', 'enable_rdp', 'main_client') are imported from internal modules, whose implementations are unknown but are presumably standard operational functions. No user input is directly handled in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. External libraries used are common for GUI and subprocess control. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical application entry point with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It manages server and client modes securely based on command-line arguments, relying on internal functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The security risk appears minimal, assuming the internal functions are safe and correctly implemented.",
