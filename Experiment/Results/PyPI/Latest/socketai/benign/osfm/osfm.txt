      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates extensive remote management functionalities with significant security vulnerabilities. Its capabilities for executing arbitrary commands and files, combined with unprotected network communication, classify it as high risk. While not overtly malicious, its potential for malicious use is substantial, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score around 0.75. It should be handled with caution, and deployment should include strict security controls to prevent misuse."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Overall, the code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that warrant cautious monitoring but lacks definitive evidence of malicious activity. The current scoring system appropriately reflects these findings, with low malware scores and variable obfuscation and risk scores. Continued analysis, especially de-obfuscation and behavioral monitoring, is recommended to confirm or dismiss potential threats."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a powerful remote management tool but contains significant security vulnerabilities stemming from unvalidated command execution and lack of access controls. While no malicious payloads are evident, the system's design allows for high-risk exploitation if accessed by malicious actors."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows utility performing standard maintenance tasks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The potential for misuse exists but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting the possibility of misuse rather than malicious activity."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script provides powerful remote control capabilities, including executing arbitrary commands and installing software without validation, posing significant security risks. Its ability to run untrusted code remotely classifies it as highly dangerous if exploited. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score around 0.85, reflecting its potential for malicious activity and system compromise."

      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and non-malicious, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified, and the absence of obfuscation is confirmed. External functions should be reviewed separately for security, but based on this code alone, it is safe."
