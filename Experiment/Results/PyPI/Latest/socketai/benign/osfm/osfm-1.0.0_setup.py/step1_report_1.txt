  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; static code analysis only.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies and creation of console script entry point.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py imports standard setuptools functions and defines package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. All dependencies are common libraries, and the entry point points to a typical main function within the package. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden malicious logic. The script appears to be a straightforward package configuration script with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
