{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'osfm', including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "User input via the setup script, package metadata, and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of package installation, package entry point invocation ('osfm'), potential installation of dependencies.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration data flows into installation process, dependencies are fetched and installed, and entry point is made executable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The setup script is standard and does not perform any runtime operations or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not execute any code beyond configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The dependencies are common Python packages used for GUI and notifications. No input reading, no data leaks, and no external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a typical package configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines how to package and install the 'osfm' application.",
