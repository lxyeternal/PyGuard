  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'osfm' Python project, enabling installation and script entry point setup.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup.py file, specifically the import statement and setup() function with its parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious code execution within this setup.py script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply specifies static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code adheres to standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with package details, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. All components are standard for Python packaging. Dependencies listed are common packages without suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and follows typical patterns for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code appears to be a standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It merely specifies project metadata, dependencies, and an entry point for execution.",
