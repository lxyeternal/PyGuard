  "sources": "Import statements for setup tools, package discovery, and dependency specification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data handling or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as this is static setup code; dependencies are declared statically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors. The dependencies listed are common for GUI and notification functionalities. The script does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. All elements conform to standard practices for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a typical, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
