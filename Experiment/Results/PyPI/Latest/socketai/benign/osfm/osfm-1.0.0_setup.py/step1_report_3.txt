  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'osfm' Python project",
  "sources": "User input from the setup.py file, primarily static code defining dependencies and entry points",
  "sinks": "None; no execution of untrusted data, network, or sensitive operations occurs",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares package setup information without data flow or execution paths involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup configuration without anomalies or suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py file uses setuptools to define a package called 'osfm' with specified dependencies and a console script entry point. There is no dynamic code, no input reading, and no execution of untrusted data. The dependencies are common packages for GUI and notification functionalities. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard package configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
