  "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious due to obfuscation and dynamic external code execution, which could be exploited for malicious payloads. While no direct malicious actions are observed, the potential for harm warrants high suspicion. The malware score should be set to 0.75 or higher, and the overall security risk should be considered elevated."
