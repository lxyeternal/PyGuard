  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup pattern with no inherent malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk lies in the external 'meta' module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The overall security risk score should be low, with a slight increase if the trustworthiness of 'meta' is uncertain."
