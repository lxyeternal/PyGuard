  "purpose": "Set up environment paths and import the Metaclass from the meta module.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine script directory; accesses environment via os and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used; import of 'meta' could execute external code if malicious.",
  "flows": "Determines current directory, appends parent directory to sys.path, then imports 'meta'.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or suspicious code; reliance on external 'meta' module introduces external risk.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard relative path setup for module imports, which is common in Python projects. It uses os.path to find the current script directory, then appends its parent directory to sys.path to enable relative imports. The import of 'meta' from the module suggests dependency on external code, which could be malicious if compromised. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious functions are present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the 'meta' module, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup pattern with no inherent malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk lies in the external 'meta' module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The overall security risk score should be low, with a slight increase if the trustworthiness of 'meta' is uncertain.",
