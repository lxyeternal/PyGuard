      "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious due to obfuscation and dynamic external code execution, which could be exploited for malicious payloads. While no direct malicious actions are observed, the potential for harm warrants high suspicion. The malware score should be set to 0.75 or higher, and the overall security risk should be considered elevated."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup pattern with no inherent malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk lies in the external 'meta' module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The overall security risk score should be low, with a slight increase if the trustworthiness of 'meta' is uncertain."
