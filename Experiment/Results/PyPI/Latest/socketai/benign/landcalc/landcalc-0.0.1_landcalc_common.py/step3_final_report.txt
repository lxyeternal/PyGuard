  "purpose": "Simple utility function that prints 'Hello World!' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print statement.",
  "flows": "Function call leads directly to print output; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that outputs a static message. It involves no external data, dependencies, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its benign nature. All reports correctly identify the lack of security issues, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial utility function with no security implications. It poses no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
