  "flows": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward metadata declaration with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. Confidence is high (1), as the code's purpose and content are unambiguous. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The email address is standard in package metadata and does not pose a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious package metadata declaration with no security concerns. All reviews are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
