  "purpose": "Define package metadata for LandCalc, including author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "Code reads static string assignments for author, email, and version variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only static metadata is assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple metadata assignment without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata declarations: author, email, and version. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no potentially dangerous operations. The presence of an email address could be considered sensitive, but it is standard in package metadata. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata header with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines author information and versioning, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
