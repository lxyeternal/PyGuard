  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is purely static variable assignments for package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__).\n   - No executable logic, data input/output, network activity, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is benign, serving solely as package metadata.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious behavior is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No evidence of any malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The only minor note is that the email address is public, but this is standard for package metadata and not a security concern.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard, non-malicious package metadata declaration.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. There are no security concerns with this code snippet.",
