  "sources": "Assignment of author, email, and version metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only sets metadata variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module-level metadata declaration, defining author, email, and version strings. There are no data input, processing, or output operations, and no external library usage or dynamic code execution. The code appears standard for a package's top-level __init__.py or metadata setup. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to declare package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
