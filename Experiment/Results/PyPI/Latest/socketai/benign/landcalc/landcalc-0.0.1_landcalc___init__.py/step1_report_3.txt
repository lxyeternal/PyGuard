  "purpose": "Define top-level package metadata for LandCalc",
  "sources": "Code reads static metadata attributes: __author__, __email__, __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, no external data output or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static attributes are not used as input sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets are not evident beyond metadata; no obfuscation, no malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code only declares package metadata variables with static strings. No input, no external data access, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The metadata could be misused if it contained malicious info, but as-is, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no security concern.",
