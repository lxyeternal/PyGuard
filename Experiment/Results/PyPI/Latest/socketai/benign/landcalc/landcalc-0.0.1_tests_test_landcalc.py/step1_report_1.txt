  "purpose": "Unit testing for the `landcalc` package",
  "sources": "Import statements and the test class setup",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "None; test functions are placeholders with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard test scaffold",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic unit test structure using Python's unittest framework. It imports the landcalc package and defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a placeholder test method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code appears to be a minimal test template with no execution beyond class/method definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless test scaffold with no signs of malware or security issues. It does not perform any untrusted operations or data handling. The overall security risk is negligible.",
