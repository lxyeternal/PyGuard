  "purpose": "Unit testing for the `landcalc` package",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'import unittest' and 'from landcalc import landcalc'",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or malicious effects",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is primarily boilerplate test setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard testing structure with no hidden or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal unit test skeleton for the 'landcalc' package. It imports standard testing libraries and the package itself, then defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a placeholder test method. There are no data input/output, no use of untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, benign test scaffold without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical boilerplate for unit testing with no malicious or security concerns. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
