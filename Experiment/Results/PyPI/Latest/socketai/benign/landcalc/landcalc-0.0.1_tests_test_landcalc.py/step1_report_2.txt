  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'landcalc' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'landcalc' from the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; standard test scaffolding.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; empty test methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unittest skeleton for the 'landcalc' package. It imports the package, defines a test class, and includes placeholder setup, teardown, and test methods. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure is typical for initial test scaffolding. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic unit test skeleton with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a scaffold for further tests and contains no security risks or malware indicators.",
