{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder or main module indicator, containing only a comment with no executable statements or data handling.",
  "sources": "There are no sources; the code contains only a comment and no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output any data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment indicating 'Main module.' with no functions, variables, imports, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as a benign placeholder with no operational or security implications. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the code's trivial nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The absence of code, data flows, or external interactions confirms the low threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
