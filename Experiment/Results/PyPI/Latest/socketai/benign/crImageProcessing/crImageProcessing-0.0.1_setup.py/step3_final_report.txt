  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads static files and configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static file reads to setup() invocation; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files and invokes setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with consistent reasoning and appropriate zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and adherence to common practices support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
