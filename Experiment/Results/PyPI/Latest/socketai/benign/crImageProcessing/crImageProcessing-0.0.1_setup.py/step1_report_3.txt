{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'crImageProcessing', intended to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data; the script primarily reads files and calls setup().",
  "flows": "Reading files -> passing data to setup() function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the script uses standard setup tools and file reads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup routines: it reads the README for description and requirements.txt for dependencies. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious behaviors such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. The URL points to a GitHub repository, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package initialization tasks securely.",
