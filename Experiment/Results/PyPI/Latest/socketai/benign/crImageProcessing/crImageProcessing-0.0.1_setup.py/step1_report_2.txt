{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'crImageProcessing'. Its purpose is to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; configuration parameters within setup() function",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no network communication, file writing, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables used for package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data flows to critical functions with security implications",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of standard setuptools library; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script loads package description and requirements from external files, then calls setup() with package metadata. All actions are typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted inputs beyond reading static files. The code follows standard practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and there are no security risks identified. It is safe to use and deploy.",
