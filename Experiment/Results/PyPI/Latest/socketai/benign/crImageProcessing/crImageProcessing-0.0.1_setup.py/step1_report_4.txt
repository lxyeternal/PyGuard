  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package called 'crImageProcessing', specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables used in setup(), but these are static files and do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script loads documentation and dependency information from local files and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic evaluation is present. It is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
