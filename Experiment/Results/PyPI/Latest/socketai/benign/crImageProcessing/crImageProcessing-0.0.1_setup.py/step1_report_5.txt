{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'crImageProcessing', including reading dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package discovery via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into critical operations or external systems are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (README.md, requirements.txt) into variables used in setup(), no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; standard setup script with open/read operations",
  "analysis": "The script reads external files to gather package metadata and dependencies, then calls setup() with this information. There are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external network interactions. The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script, with safe file handling and package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
