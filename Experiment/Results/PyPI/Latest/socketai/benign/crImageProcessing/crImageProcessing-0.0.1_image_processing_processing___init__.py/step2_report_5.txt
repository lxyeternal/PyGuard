  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the absence of actual code and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports acknowledge the lack of code, which limits the ability to confirm any malicious activity.\n- The scores for malware are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of code and suspicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated scores are also 0, indicating no signs of obfuscation were identified, which is reasonable given the lack of code.\n- The security risk scores are mostly low (0.2), which is acceptable considering the reports' conclusions and the lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose, sources, sinks, flows:** All unspecified due to no code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states that no analysis can be performed.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Comment:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with no code to analyze.\n- Correctly assigns zero scores.\n- **Comment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning; no code, no analysis.\n- Scores are zero, consistent.\n- **Comment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly more detailed; mentions a confidence of 0.7 and a security risk of 0.2.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** They recognize the lack of code but note that the code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is low (0.2). This seems reasonable given the cautious approach.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low security risk score reflects the absence of suspicious patterns but maintains some minimal concern due to the inability to fully analyze.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more detailed, mentioning potential data flows and imported modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code appears normal.\n- **Comment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and critical notes:\n\n- **Scores higher than 0.5:** None of the reports assign high scores, which is appropriate given the lack of code. If any report had assigned higher scores without evidence, that would be unreasonable.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior can be inferred.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Also correctly 0, given no evidence of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, which is acceptable for a cautious estimate in the absence of code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — a conservative estimate acknowledging the inability to fully analyze.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. They appropriately reflect the lack of code and the inability to identify malicious behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with best practices when code is unavailable for review.",
