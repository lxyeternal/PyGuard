  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or module, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from files, user input, environment variables, network requests, or data from third-party libraries. Since no code is provided, this cannot be specifically identified.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include data writes to files, network communications, system commands, or environment modifications. Without the actual code, specific sinks cannot be pinpointed.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be analyzed without the code, but typically involves untrusted data propagating through variables to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided to analyze; thus, no anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs, can be identified.",
  "analysis": "No code was provided for review. Without the code, no step-by-step analysis can be conducted, including source, sink, or flow identification.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine purpose, data sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior due to absence of code. Therefore, no specific security risks can be assessed.",
