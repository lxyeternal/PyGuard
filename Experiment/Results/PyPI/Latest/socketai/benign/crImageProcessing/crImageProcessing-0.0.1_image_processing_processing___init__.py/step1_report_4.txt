  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are evident in the code fragment.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from input sources to sinks exists within the given code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are apparent in the visible code. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review indicates that the code does not contain malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The lack of data sources, sinks, or complex control flow suggests no malicious intent. Since only an empty or minimal code fragment is provided, confidence is limited but the observable code does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code snippet. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
