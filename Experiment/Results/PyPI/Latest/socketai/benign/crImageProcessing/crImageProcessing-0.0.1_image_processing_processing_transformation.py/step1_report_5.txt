{
  "purpose": "Resize an input image proportionally using the skimage.transform.resize function.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (presumably an image array), 'proportion' (a float between 0 and 1).",
  "sinks": "The function outputs 'image_resized'; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' and 'proportion' are used to calculate new dimensions, which are passed to resize(), resulting in 'image_resized'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard image processing functions is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function for image resizing and defines a function that validates the 'proportion' input. It calculates new image dimensions based on the input proportion and applies the resize function with anti-aliasing. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code performs a typical image processing task securely and straightforwardly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image resizing function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on image manipulation.",
