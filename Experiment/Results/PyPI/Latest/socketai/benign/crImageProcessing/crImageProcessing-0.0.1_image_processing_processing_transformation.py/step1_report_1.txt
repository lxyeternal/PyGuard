{
  "purpose": "Resize an image based on a given proportion using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Reads input image from the parameter 'image' and the 'proportion' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Returns resized image; no sinks involved as there are no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' and 'proportion' flow into the resize function; no external data flow or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of 'assert' for input validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'resize' from skimage.transform, defines a function to resize an image based on a proportion, validates input with an assertion, calculates new dimensions, performs resizing with anti-aliasing, and returns the resized image. The code performs standard image processing without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No external network or system calls, no obfuscated code, and no hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image resizing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
