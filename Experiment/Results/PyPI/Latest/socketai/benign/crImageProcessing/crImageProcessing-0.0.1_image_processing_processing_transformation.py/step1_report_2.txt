  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' (expected to be an image array), 'proportion' (expected to be a float between 0 and 1).",
  "sinks": "The resize function processes the image array; no direct data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input image and proportion are used to compute new dimensions, then passed to resize, which outputs a resized image.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. The assert ensures 'proportion' is within valid bounds; no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard image processing function from skimage, defines a function to resize images proportionally with validation, and returns the resized image. No untrusted data is used insecurely, no network or file operations are performed, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward image resizing operation with input validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
