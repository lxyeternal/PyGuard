  "purpose": "Resize an input image based on a specified proportion, primarily for image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'image' and 'proportion'.",
  "sinks": "The 'resize' function from 'skimage.transform', which processes the image data.",
  "flows": "Input 'image' is read; 'proportion' influences calculation of new dimensions; 'resize' function processes image based on computed size.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code performs a standard image resize operation with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a resizing function from skimage.transform. It defines a function to resize images proportionally, validating the proportion input. It calculates new dimensions based on the input image shape and the proportion, then applies the resize function with anti-aliasing. No external network calls, no suspicious data handling, and no unusual code constructs are present. The code appears to perform a straightforward image resizing operation without malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image processing utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe, expected operations within image resizing tasks.",
