{
  "purpose": "Resize an image proportionally using skimage.transform.resize",
  "sources": "Reads input image data from the parameter 'image'",
  "sinks": "Returns the resized image; no direct data leak or external data sink",
  "flows": "Image data flows from input 'image' to the 'resize' function, then to the output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward image resize operation. It validates 'proportion', calculates new dimensions, and uses skimage.transform.resize to resize the image with anti-aliasing. No external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no obfuscated or dynamic code present. All functions are standard image processing routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate image resizing function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
