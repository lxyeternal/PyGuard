{
  "purpose": "The code compares two images to find their difference and performs histogram matching for image transfer.",
  "sources": "The functions take images as input parameters, which could potentially be untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data for external effects; no network, file, or system command operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through image comparison and histogram matching functions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. Use of standard libraries with typical image processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard image processing functions from well-known libraries (numpy and skimage) without any suspicious or obfuscated code. It asserts shape equality, converts images to grayscale, calculates structural similarity, and normalizes the difference image. The histogram matching function is straightforward. No hidden code, malicious network activity, or malicious file operations are evident. The code appears to serve legitimate image processing purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate image comparison and histogram matching without any malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and does not process or leak data maliciously.",
