{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to compare two images for differences and perform histogram matching between images.",
  "sources": "Reads two input images (image1, image2) passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data into potentially dangerous operations; output functions are standard image processing routines.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed to compute similarity and histogram matching, with no data being sent externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The functions perform standard image processing tasks without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common image processing libraries and defines two functions: 'find_difference' and 'transfer_histogram'. 'find_difference' asserts that images have the same shape, converts them to grayscale, computes structural similarity, and normalizes the difference image. 'transfer_histogram' performs histogram matching between images. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The code appears to be standard image comparison and processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, performing standard image analysis operations without malicious intent or security risks. It has no suspicious behavior or malicious indicators.",
