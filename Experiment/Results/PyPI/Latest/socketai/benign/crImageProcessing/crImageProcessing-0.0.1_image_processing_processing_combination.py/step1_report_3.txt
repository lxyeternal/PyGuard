{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform image processing tasks, specifically comparing images and transferring histogram properties between images.",
  "sources": "Reads input images via function parameters 'image1' and 'image2', which are expected to be image data arrays.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; functions process images internally and return processed images or similarity scores.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through grayscale conversion, similarity calculation, normalization, and histogram matching; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard image processing tasks with well-known libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries (numpy, skimage) and performs common image comparison and histogram matching operations. Assertions check for consistent image shapes. The functions execute typical image processing workflows: converting to grayscale, computing structural similarity, normalizing difference images, and matching histograms. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code does not interact with external systems, perform network operations, or access sensitive data beyond image processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and functions without any obfuscated or suspicious code segments. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns.",
