{
  "purpose": "The code compares two images to find their difference and performs histogram matching for color transfer.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'image1' and 'image2' which are expected to be image data inputs, possibly from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write data to external systems, network, or file system.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through functions that compute similarity and histogram matching, with no data sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard image processing libraries and functions without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common image processing libraries and defines two functions: one for image difference calculation using structural similarity, and one for histogram matching. The functions handle images assuming they are numpy arrays with proper shapes, performing operations like grayscaling, histogram matching, and normalization. There are no inputs or outputs to external systems, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard image processing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image comparison and processing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It performs legitimate image analysis functions using well-known libraries.",
