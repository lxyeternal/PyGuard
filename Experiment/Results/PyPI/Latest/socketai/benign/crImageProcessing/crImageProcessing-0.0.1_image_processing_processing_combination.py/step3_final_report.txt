  "purpose": "Performs image comparison and histogram transfer using standard image processing techniques.",
  "sources": "Reads input images passed as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Processes images in memory; no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed through grayscale conversion, similarity computation, and histogram matching functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes common libraries (numpy, skimage) to perform image similarity analysis and histogram matching. It converts images to grayscale, computes structural similarity, normalizes the difference image, and matches histograms. There are no external network calls, file operations, or system modifications. Input validation is minimal but appropriate. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions operate solely on provided image data, with no evident security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign image processing utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk primarily related to handling untrusted input images, which is typical for such functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.1.",
