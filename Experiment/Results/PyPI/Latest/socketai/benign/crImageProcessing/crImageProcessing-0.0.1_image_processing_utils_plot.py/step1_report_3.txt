{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to plot images, compare multiple images, and plot histograms of images for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code uses matplotlib functions to display images and histograms; no untrusted data outputs or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input image data flows into plotting functions and is displayed via matplotlib; no data is sent or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports matplotlib.pyplot and defines three visualization functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. These functions display images and histograms based on input data, with no data transformation, external input handling, or network activity. The code solely visualizes provided image data without modifying or transmitting it. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is straightforward and adheres to typical plotting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualization of images and their histograms. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data flows, or security risks detected.",
