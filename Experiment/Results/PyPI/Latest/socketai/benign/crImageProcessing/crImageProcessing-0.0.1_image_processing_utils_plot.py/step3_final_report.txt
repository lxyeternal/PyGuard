{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for displaying images and histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The functions accept image data as parameters; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data is transmitted or written externally; visualization occurs locally within the environment.",
  "flows": "Input images are passed to plotting functions which render them directly; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward visualization routines that display images and histograms locally. It does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute malicious payloads. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The logic is clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
