{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as function arguments (e.g., 'image' in plot_image and plot_histogram; multiple images in plot_result).",
  "sinks": "The code displays images and histograms using plt.show(), which is standard; no sinks perform actions on untrusted data beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into matplotlib plotting functions, with no processing or transmission outside the local environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs are present. Variable naming is straightforward; no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines visualization functions for images and histograms with standard matplotlib calls. It accepts images as inputs and displays them without any data modification or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage appears to be for visualization purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
