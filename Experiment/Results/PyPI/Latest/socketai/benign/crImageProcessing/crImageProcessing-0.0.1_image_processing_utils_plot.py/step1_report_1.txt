{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and their histograms using matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data passed as function arguments; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations via plt.show(); no data is sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments (images) to visualization outputs; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. Functions are standard visualization routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. All functions utilize matplotlib for visualization, processing image data passed as parameters. There are no external data sources, network operations, or file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. The functions serve standard purposes related to image visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign visualization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely displays images and histograms using matplotlib.",
