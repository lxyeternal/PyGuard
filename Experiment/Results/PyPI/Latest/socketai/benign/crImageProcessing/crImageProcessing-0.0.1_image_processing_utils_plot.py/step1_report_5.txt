{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for images, including plotting images, plotting multiple images with titles, and plotting histograms of image color channels.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data from input parameters provided to the functions (image, args).",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib functions display images and histograms; no untrusted data directly affects system state or external resources beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Input images are passed into plotting functions, which then process and display them via matplotlib; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is standard visualization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram. Each function takes image data as input, processes it for visualization, and displays the result using matplotlib. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies solely on the matplotlib library for visualization and does not perform any insecure operations or data handling beyond plotting. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard image visualization code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely displays images and histograms as intended without exposing or transmitting data maliciously.",
