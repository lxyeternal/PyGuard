{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing images and histograms, likely for image processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data through function parameters, specifically 'image' variables passed to plot_image, plot_result, and plot_histogram functions.",
  "sinks": "The code uses matplotlib's plotting functions which display images and histograms; no data is sent over networks or saved to disk explicitly within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (images) to visualization outputs via matplotlib display calls; no untrusted input handling or external data interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code solely focuses on visualization. Variable names and structure are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions for plotting images and histograms using matplotlib. All input images are visualized locally; there are no external data reads, no data manipulation beyond visualization, and no network or file system interactions. The code appears to be straightforward visualization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard image visualization functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It operates solely on provided image data and displays results locally, with no indication of malicious activity or security concerns.",
