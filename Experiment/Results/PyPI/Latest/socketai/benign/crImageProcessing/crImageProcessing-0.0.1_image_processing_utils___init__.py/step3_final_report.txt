  "purpose": "Analysis of obfuscated Python code with dynamic eval/exec to assess malicious intent and security risks.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic eval/exec calls, misleading variable names, encoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file operations, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (obfuscated strings, user input, environment variables) passing through eval/exec to sensitive operations or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec with encoded strings, indirect function calls, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common tactics to conceal malicious behavior. No explicit malicious activity such as data exfiltration or system damage is confirmed, but the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation raises suspicion. The scores assigned (malware 0.3-0.4, obfuscated 0.7, security risk 0.6) are consistent with the analysis, indicating a moderate threat level warranting caution but not definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques that could hide malicious intent. While no direct malicious actions are confirmed, the potential for malicious payloads exists, justifying cautious scoring and further investigation.",
