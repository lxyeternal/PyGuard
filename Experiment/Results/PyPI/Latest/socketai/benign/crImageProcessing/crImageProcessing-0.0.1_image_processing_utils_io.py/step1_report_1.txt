  "purpose": "To read and save images using the scikit-image library.",
  "sources": "The function reads image data from a file path provided as input.",
  "sinks": "The save_image function writes image data to a specified file path.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> imread() -> image data -> save_image() -> file output path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No data leakage, code injection, or backdoors present. Usage of standard library functions without parameters that suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from skimage.io for reading and saving images. It defines two straightforward functions: one to read images with optional grayscale conversion, another to save images. No user input sanitization issues, no external network communications, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The functions perform standard image I/O operations without any hidden or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple utility module for image processing tasks, aligned with typical usage patterns and without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard image input/output operations without any malicious features or security risks. It shows no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
