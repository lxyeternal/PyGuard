{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read and save images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter in read_image and save_image functions, which accepts file paths to read or save images.",
  "sinks": "The imread and imsave functions, which handle file operations based on the provided paths.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' flows into imread or imsave; images are processed and returned or saved accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions for image I/O operations using skimage. Both functions take file paths as input, which are standard inputs. The functions perform straightforward image reading and saving without any manipulation, encoding, or network communication. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code or backdoors. The use of standard library functions with typical parameters indicates benign behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for image processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, straightforward, and benign. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as utility functions for image input/output without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
