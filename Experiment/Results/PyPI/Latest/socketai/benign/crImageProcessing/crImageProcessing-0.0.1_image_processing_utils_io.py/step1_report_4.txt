{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to read and save images using the skimage library.",
  "sources": "The functions read_image and save_image accept user-provided 'path' inputs, which are used to read from and write to the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The 'imread' and 'imsave' functions access the filesystem based on the provided paths. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input paths flow into 'imread' and 'imsave' functions; data from 'imread' could potentially be processed further, but here it is simply returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple wrapper functions around skimage.io's image reading and saving functionalities. It accepts file paths as input and performs basic file I/O operations without additional processing. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behaviors. The functions depend on user input for file paths, which could potentially be misused if user input is malicious, but as is, the code performs standard image I/O operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for reading and saving images, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply wraps existing library functions without adding any malicious logic or exposing sensitive data.",
