{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to read and save images using skimage.io, likely for image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The 'path' parameter in read_image and save_image functions, which accept external file paths for reading and writing images.",
  "sinks": "The imread and imsave functions from skimage.io; these are standard image I/O functions that could process untrusted files but do not inherently introduce malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' flows into imread; image data flows from imread to return; image data flows into imsave along with output 'path'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or malicious functions present. The code uses standard image processing functions with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions for reading and saving images. It uses skimage's imread and imsave without any additional processing, environment variables, or network activity. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The functions accept external paths, which could be exploited if misused, but as written, the code itself does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image I/O utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on trusted library functions and does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
