  "purpose": "Functions for reading and saving images using skimage.io",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'path' in read_image and save_image functions",
  "sinks": "imread and imsave functions which handle image data; potential for reading or writing malicious files",
  "flows": "Input 'path' from user to imread/imwrite; data flows from source parameters into image processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of standard skimage.io functions is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple wrapper functions around skimage.io's imread and imsave. The functions accept file paths and read or write images accordingly. No user input validation, no network communication, and no use of untrusted data beyond file paths. The code does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious behavior. It relies on trusted third-party library functions. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears straightforward and secure in the context of image I/O operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image read and write operations with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
