  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The primary concern lies with Report 1, which exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques that could conceal malicious behavior, warranting further investigation. The other reports show no signs of malicious activity. The current scores are generally appropriate; however, increasing the malware score in Report 1 to 0.6 would better reflect the suspicion level. Overall, the supply chain risk is moderate, driven mainly by obfuscation techniques, and warrants further static analysis or deobfuscation before deployment."
