  "purpose": "Client library for interacting with Google's Gemini API, capable of sending text and image data for content generation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'GEMINI_API_KEY', user-provided 'api_key' argument, image data provided via 'image_bytes' parameter.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Google API endpoint, response parsing, exception raising for API errors.",
  "flows": "API key retrieved from environment or constructor -> used in URL for API request -> optional image data encoded and included in payload -> response fetched and parsed for content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or code that performs unexpected operations. The code properly encodes image data and handles API responses.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an API client with key management through environment variables or constructor arguments, which is standard. It encodes image data securely in base64 before sending, and the API request is made via requests.post with proper error handling. Sensitive data like API keys are only handled internally; no hardcoded secrets are present. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious operations such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The exception handling appears appropriate for the context, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client implementation with proper security practices. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
