  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Google's Gemini API to generate content based on text and optional images.",
  "sources": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, function parameters (api_key, text, image_bytes), HTTP response data.",
  "sinks": "API request to https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/... with API key, response JSON data.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment variable or constructor input -> API request with payload containing text and optional image data -> Response handling and text extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. Proper error handling implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a client with an API key, encoding images to base64, constructing API request payloads, and handling responses. The API key is retrieved securely from environment variables or constructor parameters, with validation. The image encoding uses base64, a standard approach. Request construction and response parsing follow typical patterns. No malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration observed. The code interacts solely with the external Google API over HTTPS, with error handling for request failures. The functions operate as expected for a content generation client without performing any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for Google Gemini, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles API keys securely, encodes images properly, and processes responses safely. There is no indication of malware, data leaks, or supply chain attacks.",
