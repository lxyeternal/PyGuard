  "purpose": "Client for interacting with Google's Gemini API, handling text and optional image inputs securely and efficiently.",
  "sources": "Environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, constructor parameter for api_key, image_bytes input for encoding.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() call to the Google API endpoint, response.json() parsing.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment or constructor -> request payload construction -> POST request to API endpoint -> response handling and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Response parsing assumes a fixed structure, but this is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client that securely manages API keys, encodes images in base64, constructs JSON payloads, and handles responses with proper error checking. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present. The network activity is limited to official Google API endpoints over HTTPS. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture. Minor improvements could include adding request timeouts, but this does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented API client with no malicious intent or security flaws. The analysis and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
