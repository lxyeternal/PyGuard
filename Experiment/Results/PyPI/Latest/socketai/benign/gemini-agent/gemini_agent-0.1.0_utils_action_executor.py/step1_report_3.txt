  "purpose": "The code defines a class ActionExecutor that safely executes GUI automation actions via pyautogui, including running arbitrary Python code snippets with sanitization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to execute_python_action (code string), action_type and kwargs for execute_action_by_type.",
  "sinks": "exec() function call on sanitized code, pyautogui functions (click, typewrite, hotkey).",
  "flows": "Code input -> _sanitize_code() -> exec() -> pyautogui functions.",
  "anomalies": "The _sanitize_code method attempts to restrict imports but relies on regex matching and comments, which can be bypassed. Use of exec() with sanitized code still poses potential risk if sanitization is incomplete. No explicit hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. No network activity or file operations are found.",
  "analysis": "The script provides mechanisms to execute GUI automation commands safely. It sanitizes user-provided code to prevent unsafe imports, but the sanitization method is relatively simple and could be bypassed if an attacker crafts code cleverly. The core risk is the use of exec() on user input; however, the sanitization aims to limit this to certain modules. All functions use safe modules like pyautogui and time, with no apparent malicious activity or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. The potential risk is moderate due to reliance on user input and exec(), but overall, no malicious behavior or malware is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code aims to execute GUI automation commands securely with sanitization. While the sanitization is basic and could theoretically be bypassed, there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk appears low, though the use of exec() warrants caution in untrusted environments.",
