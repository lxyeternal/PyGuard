{
  "purpose": "Provides mechanisms to execute GUI actions and arbitrary Python code with minimal sanitization, potentially allowing misuse.",
  "sources": "Input code string to execute, possibly supplied externally; internal modules 'pyautogui' and 'time' for code execution.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing sanitized code; pyautogui functions performing GUI automation actions.",
  "flows": "Input code -> _sanitize_code() -> exec() -> GUI actions via pyautogui.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial sanitization that only comments out certain import statements, easily bypassed; use of exec() on untrusted input without thorough validation.",
  "analysis": "The code allows execution of arbitrary Python code via exec() after minimal sanitization, which only comments out import statements for modules other than 'pyautogui' and 'time'. This sanitization is insufficient, as malicious code can bypass it. No embedded malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious code execution if untrusted input is supplied, due to the unsafe use of exec(). The code's GUI automation functions are not malicious but could be exploited. Scores should reflect the high risk of arbitrary code execution, with malware score at 0 (no embedded malware), and a high security risk score (~0.8), considering the unsafe design.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain embedded malware or obfuscated malicious payloads but is highly insecure due to the unsafe execution of untrusted code with minimal sanitization. This poses a significant security risk if misused, but the actual code is not malicious in itself.",
