{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'gemini_agent', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author info, dependencies, and entry points; it does not read external input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct sinks that process untrusted input or data. It primarily declares setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script is static and declarative in nature.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present. All parts are typical for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and uses 'setup()' to declare package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code execution, user input, or network activity is involved. Dependencies are standard for a GUI automation and API interaction tool. The email address and URL are publicly available and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is standard and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script that clearly defines a Python package with its dependencies and entry points. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup configuration.",
