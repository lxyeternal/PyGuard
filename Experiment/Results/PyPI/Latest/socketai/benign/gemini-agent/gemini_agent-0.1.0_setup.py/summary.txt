  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security posture relies on the external 'cli:main' implementation, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is very low. No further action is necessary based solely on this code."
