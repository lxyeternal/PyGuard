{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'gemini_agent' Python package for distribution, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, dependency list, author info, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the entry point 'gemini_agent.cli:main' could execute untrusted code if malicious, but not inherently malicious here.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows involving untrusted input; dependencies and entry point are standard setup components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. All elements are typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines package info, dependencies, and entry points. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is present. The dependencies are common libraries used for GUI automation, HTTP requests, environment variable management, image processing, and data validation. The author and contact info are provided, along with a project URL. No code execution, input handling, or data manipulation occurs here that could introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script for package distribution with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks.",
