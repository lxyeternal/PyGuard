  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'gemini_agent' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; reading package metadata and dependencies during setup",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data processing identified",
  "flows": "Not applicable; standard package setup without data flows",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All dependencies are typical for a GUI automation and API interaction tool. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic present. The author email and URL are publicly available and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no input or output flows involving untrusted sources or sinks. The script performs a conventional package setup without any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
