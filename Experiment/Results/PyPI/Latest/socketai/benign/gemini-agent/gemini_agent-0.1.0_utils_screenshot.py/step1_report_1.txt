  "purpose": "Utility for capturing and managing screenshots using pyautogui.",
  "sources": "pyautogui.screenshot(), pyautogui.size(), platform.system()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or external system interactions besides screenshot capture.",
  "flows": "Input data from system calls (platform and pyautogui functions) used internally; no untrusted external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior or suspicious imports beyond standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for capturing screenshots and retrieving screen dimensions. It relies on pyautogui and platform libraries, both common for GUI automation. No user input, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform straightforward tasks without data leakage or malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for capturing screenshots with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain hidden backdoors or malicious code segments. The usage of third-party libraries is typical for this functionality.",
