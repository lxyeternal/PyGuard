  "flows": "Input: platform info and screen capture commands; Output: screenshot bytes and dimensions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no external network calls",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class to manage screenshots, capturing screen images and dimensions via pyautogui. It uses standard library imports (io, platform) and a well-known third-party library (pyautogui). No untrusted input sources, external data flows, or insecure practices are present. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate screenshot functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for capturing screenshots and retrieving screen dimensions. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks.",
