  "purpose": "Utility for capturing and managing screenshots, including retrieving screen dimensions.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS info, pyautogui.screenshot() for capturing screenshots, pyautogui.size() for screen dimensions",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform data transmission",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions perform isolated tasks without external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign screenshot utility leveraging standard libraries and pyautogui. It performs straightforward tasks without network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's functionality. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code's design and implementation are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward screenshot utility with no malicious or security risks. The existing reports accurately assess its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
