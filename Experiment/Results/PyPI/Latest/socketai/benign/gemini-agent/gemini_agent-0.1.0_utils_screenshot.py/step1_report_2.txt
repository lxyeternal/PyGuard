  "sinks": "None; all data handled within the program, no external data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Capture screenshot -> Convert to bytes; Get screen size -> Return dimensions; No external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and common methods for screen capture.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (io, platform) and a third-party library (pyautogui) for taking screenshots. The class initializes platform info, captures screenshots, and retrieves screen dimensions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The code's functions are straightforward, with no external network communication, data leakage, or hardcoded credentials.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a screenshot utility using pyautogui, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
