  "purpose": "Utility for capturing and managing screenshots, including capturing screen images and retrieving screen dimensions.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information using platform.system(), captures screenshots via pyautogui.screenshot(), and gets screen size via pyautogui.size().",
  "sinks": "Returns screenshot bytes and screen dimensions; no untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data flows are limited to internal processing and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard library and widely accepted third-party library pyautogui without any obfuscation or hidden calls.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a screenshot manager, captures screenshots, and retrieves screen size information. It uses standard, well-known libraries without any suspicious or malicious activity. No external inputs are used in a way that could lead to data leakage or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity or system modifications. It is a straightforward implementation of screenshot utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for taking screenshots and retrieving screen size information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
