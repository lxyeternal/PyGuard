  "conclusion": "The code is benign with respect to malware; the main security concern is the insecure practice of hardcoded API keys. No malicious activity or backdoors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.4) are appropriate. Recommendations include removing the hardcoded key, managing credentials securely, and validating user input to prevent potential misuse. Overall, the code is safe but could be improved for security best practices."
