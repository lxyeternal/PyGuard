  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources; analysis based on description and context.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or network effects indicated.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code seems straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as simple and benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The confidence score of 0.8 reflects high certainty in benignity. The low security risk score of 0.2 aligns with the absence of suspicious features. No suspicious signals or anomalies are present, and the reasoning is consistent with the description.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate given the description. Overall, the assessment is sound and aligns with the evidence.",
