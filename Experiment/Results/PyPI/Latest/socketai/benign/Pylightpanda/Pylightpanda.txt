      "conclusion": "The code is free of malware and obfuscation but exposes a command injection vulnerability due to unsafe command string construction with untrusted URL input. The current risk score (~0.4–0.45) is appropriate. Mitigation involves avoiding shell invocation with interpolated strings and validating inputs. The reports are accurate and consistent in their assessment."
