  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify their assessments against the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .core import get\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.0\"\n```\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is minimal: it imports a function `get` from a local module `.core` and sets a version string.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import is relative, which is common in package initialization.\n- The `get` function's implementation is unknown, but importing it alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The reports correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform any network operations.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they all agree on the benign nature of this code snippet.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the code's simplicity.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores:**\n- Since the code is benign, there is no justification for risk scores above 0.5.\n- The `malware` scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are correctly 0.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Importing a function from a local module does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign based on the snippet provided.\n- They acknowledge that the behavior of `get` cannot be determined from this snippet, but that alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If `get` is later used in a way that processes untrusted data, that could change the risk assessment, but based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n- The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.",
