  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: setting a version string and importing a 'get' function from a local 'core' module.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The import is a relative import from a local module, typical in package initialization.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The 'get' function's behavior is unknown, but merely importing it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- **Issue presence:** None of the reports identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code snippet. The code appears benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical flaws:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential improvements:** The reports could mention that without seeing the implementation of 'get', we cannot fully assess potential risks associated with its behavior, but this is a minor point given the current snippet.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, the scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, there is no need to justify higher scores.\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior based on assumptions. The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward module setup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The 'get' function's behavior is unknown, but importing it alone is not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, and no further action is necessary.",
