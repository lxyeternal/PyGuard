{
  "purpose": "The code defines the version of the package and imports a function named 'get' from a local module called 'core'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.core' to access 'get'. No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports a function and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file. No unusual or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a version assignment. The import is a relative import from a local module, which is typical in package initialization. No dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
