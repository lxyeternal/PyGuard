{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module with a version string and imports a function called 'get' from a local module named 'core'.",
  "sources": "The code imports data/functionality from a local module './core'. No external inputs are read directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the import does not involve untrusted sources, and the version assignment is static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a version string. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The imported 'get' function's behavior cannot be determined from this snippet alone, but merely importing it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and appears to be a standard module setup with versioning and a local import. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
