{
  "purpose": "Defines a module with a version string and imports the 'get' function from a local 'core' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .core import get' is a source of data flow if 'get' is used later.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; no data output or external connections are visible.",
  "flows": "Potential flow from the imported 'get' function (if used elsewhere), but not shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no obvious anomalies. The import is relative, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets a version string and imports a function. No data processing, no input/output handling, and no suspicious code patterns. The 'get' function could potentially be used elsewhere, but based on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no evidence of malicious intent. The simplicity suggests this is a straightforward module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with a version and an import; there are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
