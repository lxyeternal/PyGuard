  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Data Flow**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment and a relative import of `get` from a local `core` module.\n   - There are no external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The import of `get` could potentially be used elsewhere, but in this snippet, there's no indication of malicious use.\n\n2. **Presence of Anomalies or Suspicious Patterns**:\n   - No report notes any anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - The code appears to be standard package initialization code, typical for Python modules.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious indicators.\n   - The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Score Reasonableness & Justification**:\n   - The high confidence scores (mostly 1, some 0.9) are justified, given the straightforward, non-suspicious nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - Since the `get` function is imported but not used here, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. However, if in the broader context `get` performs malicious actions, that would be outside the scope of this snippet.\n   - The reports correctly do not assume any malicious intent based solely on this code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & My Own Estimate**:\n   - Given all the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n   - I would assign the following scores:\n     - **Malware**: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n     - **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n     - **Risk**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
