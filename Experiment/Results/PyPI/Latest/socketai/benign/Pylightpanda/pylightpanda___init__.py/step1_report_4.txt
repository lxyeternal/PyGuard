{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module version and imports a function 'get' from a local core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core import get",
  "sinks": "None identified in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with standard import and version declaration; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a standard version string assignment and a relative import of 'get' from a local core module. There are no data inputs, no handling of untrusted data, nor any code that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The import is local, and the version string is static and unchanging. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a minimal module setup with no malicious or anomalous behavior.",
