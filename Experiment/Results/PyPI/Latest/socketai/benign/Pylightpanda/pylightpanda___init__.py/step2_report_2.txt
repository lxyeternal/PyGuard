  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippets are straightforward: they set a version string and import a function from a local module.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or network activity are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n   - The import statement is a relative import from a local module, which is typical in package initialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify the lack of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the lack of any vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any risk or malicious activity; thus, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no data processing or external interactions.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports a local function and sets a version string, there's no malware activity.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code appears benign.\n   - They acknowledge the possibility of the 'get' function doing something malicious, but from this snippet alone, there's no evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization snippet.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
