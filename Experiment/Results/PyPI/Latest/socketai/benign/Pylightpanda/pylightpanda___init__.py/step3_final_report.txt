{
  "purpose": "Module initialization: sets version and imports a local 'get' function.",
  "sources": "Relative import from '.core' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Import of 'get' from local module; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal, straightforward code with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing a function from a local module and setting a version string. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The import is standard for package modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The 'get' function's implementation is unknown, but its import alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any network operations. All signals point to benign, standard package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal nature and lack of suspicious patterns support a safe assessment. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
