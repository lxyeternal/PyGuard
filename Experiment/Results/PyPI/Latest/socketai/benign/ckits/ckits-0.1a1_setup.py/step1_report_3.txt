{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including requirements and custom installation commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'requirements.txt' and imports package attributes from 'ckits.attribute'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code does not handle user input or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading 'requirements.txt' to setting up package parameters, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of 'setuptools' for packaging is standard. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and setup configuration, including reading requirements from a file. It imports attributes from a local module and sets up package info, requiring no external or untrusted input processing beyond reading a file. The custom install class does not perform any malicious actions; it simply calls the parent method. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as expected for package configuration without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
