{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'requirements.txt' file during requirements processing and package metadata variables imported from 'ckits.attribute'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations; no external data outputs or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from a local file to include in installation dependencies; uses imported metadata variables for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup and configuration using standard setuptools functions. It defines a custom install class that executes the default installation process with no additional commands, which is benign. The requirements are loaded from a local 'requirements.txt' file without validation or manipulation. All imported variables are used solely for metadata. There are no code injection points, external data handling beyond reading a file, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It follows standard practices and does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
