{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata, requirements, and a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'requirements.txt' to get dependencies and imports package attributes from 'ckits.attribute'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to untrusted data processing or external system control; no network calls or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from a file and uses imported package attributes for metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install class is standard; no suspicious or unusual code structures detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing package attributes for metadata, reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt', and defining a custom installation command. All operations are straightforward and align with standard packaging practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. No suspicious anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It follows standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
