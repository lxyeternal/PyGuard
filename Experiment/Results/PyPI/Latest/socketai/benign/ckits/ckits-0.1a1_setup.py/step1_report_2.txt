{
  "purpose": "This script is used for configuring the setup and installation of a Python package, including reading requirements and customizing the install process.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'requirements.txt' file and imported attributes from 'ckits.attribute' module",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data directly; setup configuration itself is standard and does not execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file -> Uses setup() to configure package -> CustomInstallCommand run method calls standard install",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools. It imports attributes for project info, reads requirements from a file, and defines a custom install command that simply calls the parent run method. No external data is processed unsafely, no dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The code structure and syntax are straightforward and conformant with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and installation procedures without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
