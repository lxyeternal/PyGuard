{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and custom install commands.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from imported attributes, reads requirements from 'requirements.txt', and uses standard setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is reading the 'requirements.txt' file, which could be manipulated if the file is tampered with, but no untrusted data is executed or used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "The 'read_requirements' function reads data from a file and returns it as a list; the setup() function uses imported metadata and requirements to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, and no external network connections or code execution from untrusted sources are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies using standard setuptools practices. The only file I/O occurs in reading 'requirements.txt', which is typical for setup scripts. No code injection, command execution, or malicious behavior is observed. All imported attributes appear to be from a local module, not external or suspicious sources. The custom install class does not execute any additional or malicious code beyond the standard installation process. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It reads package information and dependencies securely from local sources and defines a custom install command without executing any malicious actions.",
