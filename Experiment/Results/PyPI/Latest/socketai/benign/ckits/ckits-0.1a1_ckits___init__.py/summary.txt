  "conclusion": "Only Report 4 indicates a significant likelihood of malicious or obfuscated code, justified by the presence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and complex control flow. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient information. The overall malware score is approximately 0.6, obfuscation around 0.7, and security risk about 0.75, aligning with the detailed analysis."
