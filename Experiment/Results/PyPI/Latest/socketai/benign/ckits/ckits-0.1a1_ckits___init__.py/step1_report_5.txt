  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the setup or utility functions of a Python package, possibly for data processing or application support.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs (if present). No explicit input sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network connections or file writes, or execution of dynamically generated code if present (none observed).",
  "flows": "Data flow is not explicitly detailed; generally, data may flow from inputs or environment variables to processing functions and outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors are apparent. The code does not include obfuscation or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, primarily comprising standard library imports and typical function definitions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lack of dynamic execution, encrypted payloads, or obfuscated parts further reduces suspicion. Since the code snippet is minimal and standard, no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility or setup code without malicious intent.",
