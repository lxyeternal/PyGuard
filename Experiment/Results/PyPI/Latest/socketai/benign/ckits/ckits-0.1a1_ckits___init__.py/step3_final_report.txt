  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code segments, external data inputs (environment variables, files, user input), dynamic code execution points (eval, exec, importlib), hardcoded secrets, network or file system access.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, system commands, environment variable access, dynamic code evaluation points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, files, or user input flow into sinks like network, file system, or dynamic code execution via eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic imports, eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, complex control flow, obfuscation indicators, suspicious environment or file access patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of malicious or obfuscated scripts, especially in Report 4, which includes dynamic imports, eval statements, hardcoded secrets, and complex control flow, leading to high malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 show no suspicious behavior, with scores reflecting benign or minimal risk. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and patterns, with Report 4 appropriately scoring higher due to its suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Only Report 4 indicates a significant likelihood of malicious or obfuscated code, justified by the presence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and complex control flow. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient information. The overall malware score is approximately 0.6, obfuscation around 0.7, and security risk about 0.75, aligning with the detailed analysis.",
