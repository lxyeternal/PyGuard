      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score reflects the general risk associated with external file dependencies but does not indicate any malicious intent. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "Only Report 4 indicates a significant likelihood of malicious or obfuscated code, justified by the presence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and complex control flow. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient information. The overall malware score is approximately 0.6, obfuscation around 0.7, and security risk about 0.75, aligning with the detailed analysis."
