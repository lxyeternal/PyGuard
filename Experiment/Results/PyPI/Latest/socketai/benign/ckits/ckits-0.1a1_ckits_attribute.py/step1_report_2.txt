  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'ckits' project, including version, URL, description, and author information.",
  "sources": "Literal string assignments, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as this code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only simple string variable assignments to define project metadata such as name, version, URL, description, and author info. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, or external data sources involved. The code does not invoke any functions, external modules, or execute any logic that could be malicious. It appears to be a standard header or metadata section for a Python project, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to document project information and does not contain any code that could compromise security.",
