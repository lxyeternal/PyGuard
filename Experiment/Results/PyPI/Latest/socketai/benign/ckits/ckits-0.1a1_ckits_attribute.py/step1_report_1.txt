  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python project/package",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external data writing)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flows present)",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only variable assignments with project metadata, no suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple set of string variable assignments defining project metadata such as name, version, URL, description, author, and email. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external interactions are present. It appears to be standard boilerplate for a Python project’s metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads, and it serves a purely informational purpose.",
