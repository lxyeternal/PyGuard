  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static variable assignments defining project metadata.\n   - No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and standard for project metadata.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - Since the code is simple metadata, no reason to adjust these scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could compromise security.\n   - No external dependencies or dynamic code execution are involved.\n   - Therefore, a higher risk score is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious instructions or payloads.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities that are not evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward variable assignments.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious metadata declaration typical in Python projects. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n**System's Recommended Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet provided.",
