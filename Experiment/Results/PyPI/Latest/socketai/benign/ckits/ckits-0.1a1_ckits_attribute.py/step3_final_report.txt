{
  "purpose": "This code defines project metadata variables for a Python package, including project name, version, URL, description, author, and email.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments at the module level (__project__, __version__, __urlhome__, __description__, __author__, __author_email__).",
  "sinks": "There are no input sources or external data reads; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings to variables without dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, external data, or malicious payloads are present. The structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign, standard boilerplate code. No security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata declaration typical in Python projects. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The previous assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
