  "purpose": "Define metadata and descriptive information about the 'ckits' project, including version, URL, description, author, and email.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this code only assigns string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The code consists solely of variable assignments with project metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining metadata variables such as project name, version, URL, description, author, and email. There are no dynamic or user-input-dependent operations, no hardcoded credentials beyond author info, no code execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements. The content appears to be standard metadata initialization without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical for Python project setup files and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
