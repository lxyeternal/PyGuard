  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only assigns static string values to variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code sets project metadata variables, a common practice in Python packages for documentation and distribution. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata documentation for the package. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
