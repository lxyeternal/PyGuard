      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a remote script from a Dropbox URL during installation, which is a common tactic for delivering malicious payloads. It uses PowerShell commands to silently download a file named '634364.pyw' and then attempts to run it with 'pythonw.exe', potentially executing malicious code without user consent or awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code from an external source, which poses significant security risks and classifies the script as malicious.",
