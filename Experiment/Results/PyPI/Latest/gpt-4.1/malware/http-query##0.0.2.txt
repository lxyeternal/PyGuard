      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `push_secrets` that reads AWS credentials from the user's local `~/.aws/credentials` file and sends this sensitive information to an external webhook URL specified by the environment variable `WEB_HOOK`. This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive credentials without user consent, which can lead to unauthorized access to cloud resources, data breaches, and other security compromises. The main function also fetches data from a provided URL and displays it, but the core malicious activity is the secret exfiltration, which is hidden behind a conditional check and could be used for malicious purposes such as credential theft.",
