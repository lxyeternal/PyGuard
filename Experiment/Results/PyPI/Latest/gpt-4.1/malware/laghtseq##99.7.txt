      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or compromising the system. This pattern is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute harmful code during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a random number parameter, likely to evade detection and track individual infections. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity, such as spyware or backdoor components.",
