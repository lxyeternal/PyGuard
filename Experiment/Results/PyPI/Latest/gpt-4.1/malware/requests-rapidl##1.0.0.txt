It explicitly states that it does not collect passwords, but the overall behavior resembles malicious data exfiltration. The code is embedded within a package installation process, executing during the 'install' phase, which can deceive users into unknowingly providing sensitive information. Such activity is characteristic of malicious spyware or backdoor behavior, especially given the lack of user awareness and the potential for misuse.",
