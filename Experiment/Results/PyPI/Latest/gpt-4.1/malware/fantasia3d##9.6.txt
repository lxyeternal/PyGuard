      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The code's obfuscation of the actual malicious payload within the 'main' module and its execution during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and current working directory, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign functions and appears designed to secretly gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as tracking, profiling, or further exploitation.",
