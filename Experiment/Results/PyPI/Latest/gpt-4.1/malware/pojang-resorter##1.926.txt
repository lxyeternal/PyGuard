      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, attempts to execute an external executable file located at a specific path within the installed package directory. If this executable exists, it is run automatically without user consent or awareness. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code because it can be used to execute arbitrary or harmful programs on the user's system, potentially leading to malware infection, data theft, or other malicious activities. The code does not provide any legitimate reason for executing an external executable during installation, which strongly indicates malicious intent.",
