      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes arbitrary code during installation by importing a module named 'main' and calling its 'm()' function after the setup process completes. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run malicious payloads, such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing harmful commands without user consent. The code does not provide any legitimate reason for executing code from an external module during installation, which indicates malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the machine's MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs pointing to external servers (decoded from base64) with these details as query parameters. The script sends HTTP requests to these URLs without any apparent legitimate purpose, likely for data exfiltration or tracking. The use of base64 encoding, obfuscated URLs, and silent HTTP requests are common tactics in malicious scripts to hide data collection activities and avoid detection. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, such as spying on the user or stealing system information.",
