      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains logic that downloads and executes a remote payload from an obfuscated URL, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. Specifically, the base64-encoded URL decodes to a suspicious domain, and the script fetches a file from this URL, saves it locally, and then executes it via os.system. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code or malware on the host system, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code's obfuscation of URLs and the use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
