While such techniques are often used for legitimate anti-debugging or anti-tampering purposes, they are also commonly employed by malware to evade detection and analysis. The code terminates execution if any of these checks indicate a virtualized or monitored environment, which can hinder security researchers from analyzing the malware safely.
