      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command that, during the post-installation process, imports the 'pyprettifier' module and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter'. This behavior is suspicious because it may be used to execute code or perform actions during installation that are not directly visible. Additionally, the try-except block writes any exceptions encountered during '_post_install_action' to a temporary file (' /tmp/a'), which could be used to hide or log malicious activity. The overall pattern suggests the code could be used to execute malicious code or perform unwanted actions during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
