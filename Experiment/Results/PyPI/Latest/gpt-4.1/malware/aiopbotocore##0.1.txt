      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that sends an HTTP request to a webhook URL, including the system's hostname and public IP address as query parameters. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it attempts to exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent. The use of a webhook URL and the collection of system data suggest the code is designed to secretly gather and transmit user or system details, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
