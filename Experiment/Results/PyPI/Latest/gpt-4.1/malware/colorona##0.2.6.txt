      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent. It includes functions that exfiltrate data (__exfil__), which attempts to send system information, browser data, and potentially sensitive user data to external URLs. The presence of encoded URLs suggests command-and-control or data collection endpoints. Additionally, functions like __browser__() access browser login databases, and __dscan__() searches for Discord tokens, indicating credential harvesting. The code also gathers system info (__sys__), IP address (__ip__), and potentially sensitive account data (__mc__). The overall structure and functions point toward activities typical of malware, such as data theft, credential harvesting, and covert communication with external servers. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
