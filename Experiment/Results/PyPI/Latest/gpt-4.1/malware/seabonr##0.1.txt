      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated commands that attempt to download and execute a remote payload. Specifically, it constructs a URL from ASCII character codes pointing to a suspicious domain (raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/moneroocean_minero.sh) and then runs a shell command that fetches this script via 'curl' and pipes it directly into 'sh' for execution. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code from an external source, which is a common malicious tactic for deploying malware, cryptominers, or other harmful scripts. The use of obfuscation, silent subprocess calls, and dynamic URL construction strongly suggests malicious intent.",
