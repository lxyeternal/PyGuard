It then exfiltrates this data to an external Discord webhook. Such behavior is characteristic of malware or spyware, aiming to steal personal information without user consent and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server. The code's activities—accessing stored credentials, extracting tokens, and sending data remotely—are typical malicious behaviors associated with information theft and privacy invasion.",
