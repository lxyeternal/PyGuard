      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after performing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code from 'main' can be executed, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful instructions. Such behavior is often used by malware to run malicious payloads during package installation, making this code potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, further confirming malicious intent.",
