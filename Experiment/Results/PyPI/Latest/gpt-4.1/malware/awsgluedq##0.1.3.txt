This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control capabilities, as it contacts an external server without user consent or obvious legitimate purpose. Such activity is characteristic of malicious or potentially malicious code designed to communicate with a command-and-control server, gather information, or perform other nefarious actions during installation.",

Such behavior is often associated with malicious activities like command and control communication, data exfiltration, or environment detection, indicating that the code is likely malicious.",
