      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard installation process to download an arbitrary MP3 file from a remote URL using PowerShell, then automatically opens the downloaded file. This behavior is suspicious because it involves executing remote code and opening potentially unwanted or malicious content without user consent. The download URL could point to malicious or unwanted files, and automatically opening the file may execute embedded malicious scripts or simply annoy the user. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by silently downloading and executing external content during installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery.",
