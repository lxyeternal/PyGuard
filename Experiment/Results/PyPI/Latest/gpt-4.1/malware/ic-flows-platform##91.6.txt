      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during the package installation process, arbitrary code from an external module ('main') is executed without any validation or user consent. Such behavior can be used to run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The code's primary purpose appears to be to execute potentially malicious code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting potentially private information, suggesting it is designed for malicious purposes such as tracking, espionage, or unauthorized surveillance.",
