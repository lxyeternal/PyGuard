Additionally, it makes requests to external servers with user input, potentially for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The presence of hardcoded API keys, suspicious server endpoints, and the unsolicited transmission of user data indicate malicious intent, likely aimed at spying, data theft, or controlling the user remotely.",
