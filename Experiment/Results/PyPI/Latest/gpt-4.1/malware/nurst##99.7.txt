      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or executing harmful commands. This pattern is often used in malicious Python packages to hide malicious payloads within the installation process.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, which are common in malware or malicious scripts designed to gather and transmit user or system information without consent. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and is indicative of malicious intent.",
