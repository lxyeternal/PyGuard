      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple obfuscated and potentially malicious behaviors. It decodes and executes base64-encoded code dynamically via the 'exec' function, which is a common technique used to run hidden or malicious payloads. Additionally, it constructs and evaluates code from hex-encoded strings using 'eval', which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. These dynamic code execution methods are often used to hide malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or performing unauthorized actions. The presence of such obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since the code does not clearly reveal its purpose and employs techniques to evade static analysis.",
