      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a command upon installation (via the CustomInstall class), which checks if the current user is not 'root'. If so, it runs the 'id' command and attempts to generate a directory tree of '/etc/', then encodes this information in base64 and calls send_put_request with the encoded data. However, the send_put_request function raises the encoded string as an exception, which is an unusual and suspicious behavior. This pattern suggests the code is exfiltrating sensitive system information (user identity and '/etc/' directory contents) without user consent, potentially for malicious purposes such as data theft or reconnaissance. The obfuscation of the data encoding and the unconventional use of exception raising further indicate malicious intent.",
