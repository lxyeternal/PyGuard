      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a remote command execution backdoor. It establishes a persistent connection to a specified IP address and port, then continuously listens for commands sent from the server. Upon receiving a command, it executes it on the host system using the shell and returns the output back to the server. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially perform malicious activities such as data theft, system manipulation, or further malware deployment. Such capabilities are characteristic of malicious remote access Trojans (RATs) and are inherently harmful.",
