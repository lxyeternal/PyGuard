      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during or immediately after installation, it runs arbitrary code from an external source, which could be malicious. Such behavior can be used to execute malicious payloads, establish unauthorized access, or perform other harmful actions without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with the imported 'main' module, indicating an intent to execute hidden or malicious code during installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
