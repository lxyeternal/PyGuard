      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect detailed system and network information from the host machine, including hostnames, IP addresses, domain names, and system details, and then send this data to an external webhook URL. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or potentially unwanted surveillance or data exfiltration activities, especially since it does not require user consent and transmits data to an external server. The use of a generic webhook URL (e.g., 'https://webhook.site/gsa') suggests it may be used for testing or malicious data collection. Overall, the code exhibits malicious intent by covertly gathering and transmitting system information without user awareness.",
