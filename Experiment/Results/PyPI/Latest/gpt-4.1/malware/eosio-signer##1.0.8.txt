It then uploads this file to an external IP address via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is malicious, as it attempts to secretly transmit potentially sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. The use of environment variables for private keys and the obfuscated data collection further suggest malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'EOSIOKey' that, upon instantiation, executes system commands to retrieve hostname, user, and network configuration, and then exfiltrates this information by sending it via an HTTP POST request to an external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This behavior indicates data theft and unauthorized data exfiltration. Additionally, the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling, but the embedded system commands and network request are clear indicators of malicious intent, such as spying or data exfiltration without user consent.",
