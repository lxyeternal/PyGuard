      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL, appending the local hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is exfiltrating information about the infected host (the hostname) to an external server without user consent or awareness. Such activity is characteristic of malicious code used for command-and-control communication, data exfiltration, or tracking. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the URL further indicates malicious intent to evade detection or analysis.",
