      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes an external command to send an HTTP request to a webhook URL using 'curl' via subprocess.run(). This action occurs immediately upon execution, without any apparent legitimate purpose such as data collection or configuration. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that exfiltrate information, verify the presence of security measures, or trigger remote actions. The webhook URL could be used to receive sensitive data, confirm the presence of the script, or coordinate malicious activities. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves unauthorized external communication without user consent or transparency.",
