      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('zip.zip') during the installation process. This behavior can be exploited to run arbitrary code embedded within the ZIP file, potentially allowing malicious payloads to be executed on the target system. Such techniques are commonly used in malware to evade detection, execute hidden payloads, or establish persistence. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks related to the package itself and instead focuses on executing external code during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
