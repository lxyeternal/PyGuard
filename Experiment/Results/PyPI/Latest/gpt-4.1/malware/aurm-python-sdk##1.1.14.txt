      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute remote code on the user's machine without explicit consent, potentially leading to remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. Such actions are characteristic of malicious activity, especially since the source URL is external and the code modifies user environment configurations covertly.",
