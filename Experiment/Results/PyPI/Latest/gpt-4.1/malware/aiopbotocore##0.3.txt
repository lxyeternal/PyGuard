      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that sends an HTTP request to a webhook URL, including the system's hostname, OS name, and public IP address. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or tracking, as it collects and transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent. The use of a webhook URL and the timing of this request immediately after installation suggest an intent to secretly gather and send user environment details, which is characteristic of malicious or intrusive behavior.",
