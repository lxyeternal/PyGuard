      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an external source via a Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which can be used for malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware deployment. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
