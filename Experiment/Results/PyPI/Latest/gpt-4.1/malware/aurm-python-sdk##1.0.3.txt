It then attempts to add a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently execute arbitrary code or data on the victim's machine, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not verify the source or content of the downloaded file, making it potentially dangerous. Such actions can be used to establish backdoors, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious operations without user consent.",
