      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, potentially compromising the system or performing unwanted actions without user consent. The code's structure and the invocation of external code during setup are common tactics in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads stealthily.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
