      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains heavily obfuscated and encrypted data segments, which are decoded at runtime using dynamic import and attribute access via 'getattr' and '__import__' with obfuscated byte sequences. These sequences are reversed and decoded to reveal module names, class names, and function names, then invoked dynamically. This pattern is characteristic of malicious code designed to hide its true intent, often used to load and execute malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware without detection. The presence of such complex obfuscation, combined with the use of 'getattr' and '__import__' to dynamically import modules and execute functions, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading static analysis and executing hidden malicious actions.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes code from an external configuration file named 'config.json' via the 'exec' function. This behavior allows an attacker to modify the 'startup_code' value in 'config.json' to execute arbitrary Python code on the host system. Such dynamic execution can be exploited to run malicious commands, install malware, or perform unauthorized actions, making this code potentially malicious. The rest of the code appears to be primarily for visual effects (gradient-colored text), but the critical concern is the use of 'exec' on external input, which is a common indicator of malicious intent or a security vulnerability.",
