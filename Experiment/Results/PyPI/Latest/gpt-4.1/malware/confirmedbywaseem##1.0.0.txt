      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent, potentially enabling tracking, fingerprinting, or further malicious actions. The code appears to be designed to surreptitiously gather and transmit user environment details during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malicious package distribution.",
