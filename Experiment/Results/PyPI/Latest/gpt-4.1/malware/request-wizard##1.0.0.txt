It then exfiltrates this data to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. The script also attempts to gather system information, identify installed wallets, gaming platforms, and files matching certain keywords, and compresses or uploads these files to external servers. Its primary purpose is to compromise user privacy, steal credentials, and facilitate unauthorized access or account hijacking, which classifies it as malicious malware (information stealer and data exfiltration tool).",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits typical characteristics of malware. It downloads content from an external URL ('W4SPGRAB') and writes it to a randomly chosen file within the user's application data or temp directories, which could be malicious payloads. It then executes this payload, potentially running malicious code on the system. Additionally, it creates a registry key in the 'Run' registry to ensure persistence by automatically executing the payload on system startup, disguising it as 'SecurityHealthSystray.exe'. These behaviors—downloading and executing external code, persistence setup, and disguising as legitimate system processes—are common tactics used by malware to infect and maintain control over a system.",
