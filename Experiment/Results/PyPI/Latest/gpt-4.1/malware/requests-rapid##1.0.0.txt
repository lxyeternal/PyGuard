      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly collect detailed user information—including username, hostname, OS details, internal and external IP addresses, and approximate geolocation—and send this data to a remote server without explicit user consent. It does not collect passwords but gathers sensitive network and system data, which can be exploited for malicious purposes such as surveillance, identity theft, or targeted attacks. The implementation is embedded within a package's installation process, making it potentially deceptive and difficult for users to detect. The code explicitly warns against illegal data collection, indicating malicious intent or at least unethical behavior.",
