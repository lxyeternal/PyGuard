      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/...`). This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive metadata (such as service account tokens) from a Google Cloud environment to an attacker-controlled server. Embedding such exfiltration logic within setup scripts and executing it during installation or development setup is a common tactic for malicious actors to harvest credentials or sensitive environment information surreptitiously.",
