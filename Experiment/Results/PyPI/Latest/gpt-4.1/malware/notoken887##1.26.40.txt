      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encoded strings that appear to be designed to hide malicious payloads or commands. The presence of a class named 'TokenCryptor' with methods that perform character replacements to encode and decode data using a wide range of Unicode symbols suggests an attempt to conceal malicious instructions or data. Additionally, the large, repetitive, and seemingly nonsensical string data embedded within the code indicates an effort to obfuscate its true purpose, which is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to evade detection. The code also imports modules like 'requests', 'os', 'random', and 'string', which are commonly used in malware for network communication, file operations, or generating random data, further supporting the conclusion that this is malicious code. Overall, the code's structure, obfuscation techniques, and potential for hidden payloads point to malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration, command and control communication, or other harmful activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a mechanism for encrypting Python source code and then generating a separate 'mainscript.pyw' that, when executed, decrypts and runs the original code dynamically. This behavior is characteristic of obfuscation and concealment techniques often used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. By encrypting the code and executing it at runtime via 'exec', it can conceal malicious payloads, evade static analysis, and make reverse engineering difficult. Additionally, the use of a custom 'TokenCryptor' and dynamic code execution suggests an intent to hide malicious logic or payloads, which is a common tactic in malware or malicious scripts. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by obfuscating and executing potentially harmful code at runtime.",
