This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the user's machine without their consent or knowledge, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as malware distribution or remote code execution. The use of PowerShell commands to fetch and execute external code during installation is a common tactic in malicious scripts.",
