      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, attempts to execute an external executable file located within the package directory ('pojang_resorter/your_executable.exe'). This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code on the user's system without explicit consent. The executable could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising system security. The code does not perform any validation or checks on the executable, making it potentially malicious.",
