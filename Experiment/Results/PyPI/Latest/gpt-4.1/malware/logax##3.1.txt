      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to download an executable or script from a remote URL, save it locally, and then execute it. The URL and filename are obfuscated using base64 encoding. The script checks for a specific marker ('#[//]') in an '__init__.py' file to prevent repeated execution. If the marker is absent, it downloads the payload, executes it, and then appends the marker to '__init__.py'. This behavior indicates an attempt to stealthily fetch and run potentially malicious code from a remote server, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.",
