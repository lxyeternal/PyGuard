      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to secretly exfiltrate Telegram chat data, specifically the 'tdata' folder, by compressing it into a ZIP archive and uploading it to a Telegram bot account via the Telegram Bot API. It then deletes the ZIP file locally. Additionally, it creates a hidden Python script that monitors the parent process and terminates if the parent process ends, which is typical behavior for persistence or stealth. The overall purpose appears to be data theft and covert operation, indicating malicious intent.",
