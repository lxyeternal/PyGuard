      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote payload from an obfuscated URL. It decodes a Base64-encoded URL, retrieves the payload via HTTP, saves it to a local path, and then executes it using os.system. This pattern is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the compromised system. Additionally, the code manipulates a license file and logs activity, which could be used to hide or control malicious operations. Overall, the code's intent to fetch and run external code without user consent indicates malicious intent.",
