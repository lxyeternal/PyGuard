      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that downloads an MP3 file from a remote URL using PowerShell and then attempts to execute it. This behavior is suspicious because it involves fetching and executing a potentially arbitrary file during installation, which could be used to run malicious payloads on the user's system. The downloaded file is an MP3, which is typically harmless, but the act of automatically executing it raises concerns about malicious intent, especially since the code does not verify the file's integrity or purpose. Overall, this pattern resembles malicious behavior often seen in malware or trojans that hide malicious payloads within seemingly benign files and execute them without user consent.",
