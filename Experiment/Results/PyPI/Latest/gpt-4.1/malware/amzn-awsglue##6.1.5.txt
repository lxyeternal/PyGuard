This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to exfiltrate data, verify the presence of the package, or trigger malicious actions on the attacker's server. Embedding such network activity within a package's setup script without user consent indicates malicious intent, especially if the request is hidden or not documented as a legitimate feature.",
