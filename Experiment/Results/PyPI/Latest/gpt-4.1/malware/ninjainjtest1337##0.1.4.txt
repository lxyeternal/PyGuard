      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `get_shell` that establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP address 10.0.0.1 on port 4242, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine. Although this function is commented out in the main execution, its presence indicates malicious intent or capability. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL hosted on a domain associated with a known malicious or testing environment (oastify.com), which could be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The combination of establishing a reverse shell and communicating with a potentially malicious server strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
