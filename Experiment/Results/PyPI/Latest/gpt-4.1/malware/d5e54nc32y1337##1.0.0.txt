      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks that justify such data collection, suggesting its primary purpose is to spy on the user or system environment.",
