This request includes the system's hostname, operating system, and current public IP address, effectively exfiltrating sensitive system information without user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at tracking or compromising the user or system. The code does not perform any legitimate package management functions that justify this data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
