      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `pt()` that downloads an executable file (`sm.exe`) from a remote URL (`https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe`) and executes it on the host machine. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves retrieving and executing potentially harmful payloads without user consent. Additionally, the code's use of random filename generation and execution of downloaded files suggests an attempt to evade detection and persist on the system. The presence of a token encryption/decryption class appears to be obfuscation or a component of a larger malicious scheme, but the core malicious behavior is the silent download and execution of an external executable, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malware or a backdoor.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to encrypt Python source files and generate a separate script ('mainscript.pyw') that decrypts and executes the encrypted code at runtime. This behavior effectively obfuscates the original code, making static analysis difficult and enabling the execution of potentially malicious payloads without easy detection. The use of runtime decryption and execution (via 'exec') can be exploited to hide malicious activities, such as executing harmful code, stealing data, or establishing unauthorized access, all while avoiding straightforward code review. Therefore, the code exhibits malicious intent by facilitating covert execution of obfuscated code.",
