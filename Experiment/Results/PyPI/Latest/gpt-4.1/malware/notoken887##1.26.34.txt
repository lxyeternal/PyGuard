      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an unsolicited download and execution of a potentially malicious executable file from an external URL ('https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe') and then opens it. This behavior indicates an attempt to infect the host system with malware, which is malicious activity. Additionally, the code includes a token encryption/decryption class that uses a simple character replacement cipher, which may be used to obfuscate malicious payloads or communications. Overall, the primary malicious behavior is the automatic download and execution of a remote executable without user consent, which is a common tactic in malware distribution.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to encrypt Python source files and generate a separate script ('mainscript.pyw') that decrypts and executes the encrypted code at runtime. This behavior effectively obfuscates the original code, making static analysis difficult and enabling the execution of potentially malicious payloads without easy detection. The use of runtime decryption and execution (via 'exec') can be exploited to hide malicious activities, such as executing harmful code, stealing data, or establishing unauthorized access, all while avoiding straightforward code review. Therefore, despite appearing as a legitimate obfuscation tool, its core functionality aligns with common malicious obfuscation techniques, classifying it as malicious.",
