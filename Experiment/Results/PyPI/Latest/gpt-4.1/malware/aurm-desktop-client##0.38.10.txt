It then appends a command to source this script in the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile'). This behavior suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary code or establish persistent access, which can be malicious. The script's purpose appears to be to inject potentially harmful code into the user's environment, possibly for remote control, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
