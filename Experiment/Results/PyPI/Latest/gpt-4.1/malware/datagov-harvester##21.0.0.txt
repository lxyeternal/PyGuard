      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information, including hostnames, IP addresses, domain names, and system platform details, and then sends this data to an external webhook URL. This behavior is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, especially since the webhook URL appears arbitrary and is used to transmit potentially sensitive information without user consent. The code does not perform any benign or clearly necessary functions, and its primary purpose seems to be gathering and transmitting system data surreptitiously, which is indicative of malicious intent.",
