      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, dynamically imports and executes a function (`main`) from an external module (`pipofftheoldblock.run`) with a specific argument (`b\"man3\"`). This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially malicious code during installation, which could be used to execute arbitrary or harmful actions on the target system. The use of dynamic imports and execution within a setup script is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads, making this code suspicious and likely malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent. It collects sensitive system information such as the hostname, external IP address, current working directory, environment variables, and the output of a 'git config' command. It then encodes and compresses this data, segments it, and attempts to resolve domain names constructed from these segments, which may serve as a covert communication channel or a way to verify domain availability. Finally, it sends the collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external IP address (64.23.141.119:8080), which is suspicious and likely used for exfiltration of data. The obfuscation techniques, such as encoding, segmenting data, and DNS resolution attempts, are typical of malware trying to hide its malicious activity. Overall, this code appears designed to stealthily gather system information and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server, indicating malicious behavior.",
