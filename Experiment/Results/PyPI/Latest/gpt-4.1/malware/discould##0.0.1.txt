This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. The silent execution further indicates an intent to evade detection and user suspicion, which is typical of malicious scripts designed for exploitation or compromise.",

This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as malware delivery, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The use of PowerShell commands to download and run an external executable, especially from an untrusted source, indicates intent to compromise the host system, potentially leading to data theft, system control, or other malicious actions.",
