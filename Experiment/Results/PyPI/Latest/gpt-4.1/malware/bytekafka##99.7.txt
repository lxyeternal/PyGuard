      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or compromising the system. This pattern is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior suggests data exfiltration, potentially to gather information about the infected system for malicious purposes such as targeted attacks, surveillance, or further exploitation. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and is designed to silently transmit system data to external servers, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
