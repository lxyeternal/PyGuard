      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as downloading, installing, or executing harmful code, or establishing unauthorized access. This pattern is typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to evade detection and execute malicious actions on the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory, which is suspicious behavior. The executable's name suggests it may be a Windows-specific binary, and its execution could be used to run malicious payloads or malware. Additionally, the code logs the process and executes the file without any validation or user consent, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of random status codes and the lack of transparency about what 'windows.exe' does further suggest malicious activity, such as installing malware, backdoors, or performing unauthorized system modifications.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated and designed to hide its true intent. It uses base64 decoding, string reversal, and zlib decompression to dynamically reconstruct and execute code at runtime. This technique is commonly employed to conceal malicious payloads, such as malware, backdoors, or remote code execution exploits. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the execution of dynamically reconstructed code, indicates malicious intent aimed at evading detection and executing potentially harmful operations on the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that execute external scripts and modules with potentially malicious intent. Notably, the 'nukeserver' command imports and calls a 'nukeserver' function from an external module, which strongly suggests destructive behavior such as deleting or damaging server data or infrastructure. Additionally, the 'assign_operator' command imports and executes a function from 'forceop', which could be used to escalate privileges or take control over systems. The presence of these commands, especially 'nukeserver', indicates malicious intent to cause harm or compromise systems. The code's structure facilitates remote or automated execution of destructive actions, making it malicious.",
