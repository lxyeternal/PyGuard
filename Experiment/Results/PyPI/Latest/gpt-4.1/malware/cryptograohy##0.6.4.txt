      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation hook that attempts to import the 'pyprettifier' module and instantiate an 'EmojiConverter' object. This behavior is suspicious because it executes during package installation without any clear legitimate purpose. The code also writes exception messages to a temporary file '/tmp/a', which could be used to exfiltrate error information or serve as a marker for malicious activity. Overall, these actions suggest the code is designed to execute arbitrary code during installation, potentially for malicious purposes such as establishing backdoors, executing payloads, or manipulating the environment without user consent.",
