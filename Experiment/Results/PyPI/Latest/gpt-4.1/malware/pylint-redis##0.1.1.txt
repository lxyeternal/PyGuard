      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then performs an HTTP request to this URL, appending the current hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is likely used for command-and-control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or tracking purposes. The obfuscation and external request without clear legitimate context are common indicators of malicious activity, such as malware or spyware attempting to communicate with a remote server covertly.",
