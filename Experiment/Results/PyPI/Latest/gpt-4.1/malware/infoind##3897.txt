      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the 'infoind.osint' module, which is known to be associated with malicious activities such as information gathering, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration. The 'osint' (Open Source Intelligence) modules are often used in cyber attacks to collect sensitive information about targets without authorization. Without additional context or code, the import itself suggests potential malicious intent, especially if used to automate reconnaissance or exploit vulnerabilities. Therefore, this snippet indicates malicious behavior related to covert information gathering.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a brute-force decryption of an encrypted payload, attempting all possible numeric passwords until successful. Once decrypted, it executes the resulting code dynamically with `exec()`. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to hide malicious code within an encrypted payload and execute it at runtime, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of brute-force decryption combined with dynamic execution is a common tactic in malware to evade static analysis and conceal malicious activities.",
