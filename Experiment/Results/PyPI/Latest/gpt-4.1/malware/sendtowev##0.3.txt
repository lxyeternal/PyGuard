      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a highly sophisticated credential stealer and information extractor designed to harvest sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- Collects Discord tokens, user account details, billing info, friends, guilds, and gift codes by accessing Discord API endpoints.\n- Extracts stored passwords, cookies, credit card info, autofill data, browsing history, and bookmarks from popular browsers like Chrome, Opera, Edge, Yandex, Brave, and Vivaldi.\n- Retrieves wallet information from various cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.\n- Gathers data from messaging apps like Telegram.\n- Uploads collected data to external file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io) and sends detailed reports via Discord webhooks.\n- Implements anti-debugging and anti-VM checks to evade detection.\n- Ensures persistence by copying itself to the startup folder.\n- Uses obfuscated and multi-threaded techniques to maximize data collection efficiency.\n\nOverall, the script is designed to stealthily exfiltrate a wide range of personal, financial, and account credentials, making it malicious malware aimed at identity theft and unauthorized access.",
