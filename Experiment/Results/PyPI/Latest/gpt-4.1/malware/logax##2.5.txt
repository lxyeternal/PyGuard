      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to download an executable or script from a remote URL, save it locally, and then execute it immediately. The URL and filename are obfuscated using base64 encoding, which suggests an attempt to hide the malicious intent. The script also checks for the presence of a specific marker ('#[//]') in an '__init__.py' file to potentially avoid re-execution or to mark its presence. The core malicious behavior involves retrieving potentially harmful payloads from a remote server and executing them without user consent, which is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks.",
