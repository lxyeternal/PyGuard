This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to exfiltrate information, verify the presence of the environment, or trigger malicious actions on the attacker's server. Additionally, the request is made without any clear legitimate purpose, and the code overrides the standard installation process to ensure this request is executed every time the package is installed. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious or backdoored code designed to communicate with an attacker-controlled server without user consent.",

This behavior suggests that the script is attempting to contact a remote server, potentially to download or execute malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities. The URL and port are suspicious and do not correspond to legitimate or well-known services, indicating possible malicious intent such as command and control communication or data exfiltration.",
