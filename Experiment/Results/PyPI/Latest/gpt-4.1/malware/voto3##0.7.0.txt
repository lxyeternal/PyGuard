      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that sends an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL, transmitting the system's hostname and OS information. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to fingerprint or track the system without user consent. The webhook URL appears to be a unique identifier, suggesting it may be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration of system data. While the code itself does not perform direct malicious actions like data theft or system compromise, the hidden data exfiltration mechanism indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior.",
