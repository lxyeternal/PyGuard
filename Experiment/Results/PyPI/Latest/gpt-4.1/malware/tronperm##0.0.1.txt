      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes. It collects a private key (likely a sensitive credential) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron'), which could be used to exfiltrate sensitive information. Additionally, it performs a GET request to another endpoint ('https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/switcher') and returns 1 if the response is empty, otherwise 0. This switcher mechanism suggests the code may be part of a command-and-control setup or a conditional trigger for malicious actions. Overall, the code is designed to steal private keys and communicate with external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
