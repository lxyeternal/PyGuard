      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process, which is not typical for standard setup scripts. This behavior can be exploited to execute arbitrary code embedded within the ZIP file, potentially allowing malicious payloads to run on the target system. The use of zipimport to load code from an external archive during installation is suspicious and indicates malicious intent, especially if the ZIP contains malicious scripts or payloads. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by executing external code during package installation, which can compromise system security.",
