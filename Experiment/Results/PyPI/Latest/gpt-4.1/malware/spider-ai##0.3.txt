      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network requests to external IP addresses and domains, sending user-provided input (text, API keys, and models) to remote servers. The server responses are then returned to the user, potentially enabling data exfiltration or remote command execution. The code does not perform any legitimate processing of the input; instead, it acts as a conduit to external servers, which could be controlled by malicious actors. Additionally, the use of obfuscated or non-standard host headers and the lack of clear purpose suggest malicious intent, such as data theft, remote control, or unauthorized access.",
