      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a remote command execution backdoor. It establishes a persistent connection to a specified remote server (IP 34.30.170.63 on port 3000), then continuously receives commands from the server, executes them on the host machine via the shell, and sends back the output. This allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially perform malicious activities such as data theft, system manipulation, or further malware deployment. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious remote access Trojans (RATs) and is inherently harmful.",
