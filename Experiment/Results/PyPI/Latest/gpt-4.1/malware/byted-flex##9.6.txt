      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or executing unwanted commands. The code's obfuscation of the actual malicious payload within the 'main' module indicates malicious intent, as it leverages the installation process to execute potentially harmful code without explicit user awareness.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or user-beneficial functions and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, profiling, or further exploitation.",
