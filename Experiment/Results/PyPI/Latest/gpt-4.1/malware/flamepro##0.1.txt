      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a code obfuscator that compresses, encodes, and encrypts a given input Python script, then generates a new Python script that, when executed, decodes and decompresses the original code to run it dynamically. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, making detection and analysis more difficult. The obfuscation process involves multiple layers of encoding and encryption, which are typical characteristics of malicious code designed to evade static analysis. While the code itself does not perform malicious actions directly, its purpose is to conceal potentially harmful code, indicating malicious intent.",
