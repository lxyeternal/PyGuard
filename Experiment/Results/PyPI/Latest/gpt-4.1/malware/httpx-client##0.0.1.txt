This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution, which can lead to arbitrary code running on the victim's machine. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, including remote backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware distribution. The code's purpose appears to be to run potentially harmful code from an external source, making it malicious.",
