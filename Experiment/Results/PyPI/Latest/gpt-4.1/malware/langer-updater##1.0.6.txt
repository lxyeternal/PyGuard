      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process. This behavior can be malicious because it allows the execution of arbitrary code contained within the ZIP file, which may be used to run malicious scripts, install backdoors, or perform other harmful actions without explicit user consent or awareness. Such dynamic code execution from external sources is a common tactic in malware to evade static detection and compromise systems.",
