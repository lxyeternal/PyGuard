      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code on the target system. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data, making this code potentially harmful.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, fingerprinting, or further exploitation.",
