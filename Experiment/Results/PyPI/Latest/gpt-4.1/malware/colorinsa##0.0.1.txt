Specifically, it searches for Discord tokens, browser saved passwords, and Minecraft account credentials, which are private and should not be accessed or transmitted without user permission. The code also gathers system information such as username, computer name, hardware ID, and public IP address, likely for identification or targeting purposes. The data is then sent to a specified Discord webhook, indicating an intent to secretly harvest and transmit user data, characteristic of malware or spyware activities.",
