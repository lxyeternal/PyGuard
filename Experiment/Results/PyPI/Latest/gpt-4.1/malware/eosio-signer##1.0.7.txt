      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class `EOSIOKey` that, upon instantiation, executes system commands (`hostname`, `whoami`, `ifconfig`) and sends the contents of a temporary file (`/tmp/r`) to a remote server (`http://61.28.229.27`) via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information, which is malicious. Additionally, the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling and signing functions, but the embedded system commands and network request are clear indicators of malicious intent, such as gathering sensitive system data and transmitting it to an attacker-controlled server.",
