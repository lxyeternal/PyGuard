      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to an external server (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue) during the package installation process. This behavior can be used to exfiltrate information, verify the presence of the package in a specific environment, or trigger malicious actions on the attacker's server. Embedding such network activity within a package's setup script is a common tactic for malicious or backdoored Python packages, especially when the request is hidden within the installation process. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to an external server ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue') without any apparent legitimate purpose. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity such as exfiltration of data, command and control communication, or triggering malicious actions on the server. The code's simplicity and lack of context indicate it may be part of a malicious payload designed to connect to a remote server for malicious purposes.",
