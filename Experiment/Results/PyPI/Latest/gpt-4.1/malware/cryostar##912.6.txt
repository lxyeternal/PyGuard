      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during installation. Such behavior can be exploited to run arbitrary malicious code on the target system without user consent or awareness, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The code's structure and the automatic invocation of external code during setup are common tactics used in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
