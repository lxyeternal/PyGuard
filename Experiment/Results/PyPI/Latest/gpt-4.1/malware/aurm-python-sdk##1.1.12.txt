It then attempts to add a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary code or establish persistent access on the victim's machine, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the declared package, indicating that its primary purpose is likely malicious.",
