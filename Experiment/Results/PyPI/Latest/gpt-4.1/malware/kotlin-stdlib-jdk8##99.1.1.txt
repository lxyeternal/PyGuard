      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then makes an HTTP request to this URL, including the current hostname and module name as query parameters. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or communication with a remote server controlled by an attacker. The code does not process or validate the response content beyond printing it, indicating it may be used to receive commands or payloads. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious activity such as command-and-control communication or data theft.",
