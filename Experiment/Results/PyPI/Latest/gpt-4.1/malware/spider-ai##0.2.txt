      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration by sending user-provided input to external IP addresses (104.236.72.47) via HTTP GET requests. It appears to act as a proxy or relay, potentially capturing sensitive user input (texts, API keys, models) and transmitting it to remote servers under the guise of legitimate API calls. The presence of hardcoded headers, suspicious hostnames, and the repeated pattern of relaying user data to external servers strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data theft, command and control communication, or other nefarious activities.",
