      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports a module named 'main' and calls its 'm()' function. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation phase, which could be used to run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform other harmful actions without user consent. The code does not provide any legitimate reason for executing 'm()' during setup, indicating potential malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the machine's MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these details as query parameters. The URLs are decoded from base64 and appear to be external servers controlled by an attacker. The script sends HTTP requests to these URLs with the collected data, likely for exfiltration purposes. This behavior indicates data harvesting and potential command-and-control communication, which are characteristic of malicious activity such as malware or spyware. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and is designed to stealthily transmit user and system information to external servers, confirming its malicious intent.",
