      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities. The code's structure indicates an attempt to execute additional code automatically during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to compromise systems or perform unwanted actions without user consent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or user-beneficial functions and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system details to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as profiling, surveillance, or further exploitation.",
