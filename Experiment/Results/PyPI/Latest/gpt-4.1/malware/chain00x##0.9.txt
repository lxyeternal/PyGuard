      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior where, during installation, it makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/'). This request is likely used for tracking, exfiltration, or command-and-control purposes without user consent. The commented-out code suggests an attempt to gather system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, which could be used for fingerprinting or further malicious activities. Overall, the code's primary malicious aspect is the silent external communication during installation, which can be used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
