      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon installation. Such behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution without explicit user consent, potentially leading to malicious activities like installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing harmful payloads. The code's structure and the automatic invocation of external code during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated within the code and include a random number as a parameter, likely to evade detection or caching. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying or gathering intelligence on the infected system.",
