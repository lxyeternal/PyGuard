      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, gathers sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker (http://qpaw5pjg.requestrepo.com). This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The purpose appears to be to collect system details covertly, potentially for further exploitation or tracking. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign actions with this data, confirming its malicious intent.",
