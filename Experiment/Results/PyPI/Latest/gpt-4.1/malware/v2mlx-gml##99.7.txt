      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform harmful actions such as downloading malware, opening backdoors, or executing other malicious operations. This pattern is often used in malicious Python packages to hide malicious payloads that execute during installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or used for data exfiltration. This behavior indicates an attempt to gather and transmit potentially sensitive user and system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or command-and-control communication.",
