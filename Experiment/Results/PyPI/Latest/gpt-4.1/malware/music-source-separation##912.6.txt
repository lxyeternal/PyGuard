      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it will run arbitrary code from an external module, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unwanted actions without user consent. The code does not perform any obvious legitimate setup tasks with the imported 'main' function, indicating potential malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a random number parameter, likely to evade detection and tracking. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying or gathering intelligence on the infected system.",
