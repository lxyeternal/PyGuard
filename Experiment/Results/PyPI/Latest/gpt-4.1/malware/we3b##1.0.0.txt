      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes decrypted code fetched from an external source. Specifically, it uses the 'requests' library to retrieve encrypted payload data, decrypts it with the 'Fernet' symmetric encryption, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation, which can be used for various malicious activities such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or further compromising the system. The presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic code execution, and external data retrieval are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
