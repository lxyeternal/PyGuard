      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code can be executed without the user's knowledge or consent. Such a pattern is often used to run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the target system. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with the imported 'main' function, indicating that its primary purpose is likely malicious code execution during package installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, further confirming malicious intent.",
