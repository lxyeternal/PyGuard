This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking without user consent. Additionally, the request is made both at the module level and within a custom install command, indicating an attempt to ensure the request is executed regardless of how the package is installed. Such activity is characteristic of malicious or potentially unwanted behavior, as it can be used to gather information about the environment or communicate with a command-and-control server without user knowledge.",

Such behavior can be used to exfiltrate data, trigger malicious payloads, or communicate with a command-and-control server. The URL appears arbitrary and potentially malicious, indicating that this code could be part of a malicious operation such as data theft, remote command execution, or malware control. Without additional context, this activity is considered malicious.",
