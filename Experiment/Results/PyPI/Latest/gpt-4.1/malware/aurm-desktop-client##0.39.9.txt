It then appends a command to source this script in the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile'), effectively executing or loading potentially malicious code every time a new shell session starts. This behavior can be used to persist malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the user's environment without their knowledge. The code's intent to modify user shell configurations and execute remote code indicates malicious activity.",
