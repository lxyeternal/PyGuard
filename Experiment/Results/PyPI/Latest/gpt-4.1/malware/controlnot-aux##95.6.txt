      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that the code is designed to execute arbitrary or potentially malicious code during installation, which is a common tactic used by malicious packages to run harmful scripts without user awareness. The lack of any visible validation, security checks, or benign purpose further indicates malicious intent, especially since executing code from an external module during setup can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming malicious intent.",
