      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation script that, upon execution, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent, potentially for reconnaissance or tracking purposes. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the described package, and the external request to an obscure URL strongly suggests malicious intent.",
