      "malicious_behavior": "The code exfiltrates environment variables by sending them to an external Google Chat webhook, which can be used to harvest sensitive information such as system configurations, environment settings, or credentials. Additionally, the code includes a function that attempts to run 'printenv' via subprocess, but it does not correctly handle the output, which suggests an intent to gather environment data. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent to secretly collect and transmit sensitive system information without user consent.",
