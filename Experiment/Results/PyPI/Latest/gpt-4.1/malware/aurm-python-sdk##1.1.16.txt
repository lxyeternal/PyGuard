      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior effectively sets up a persistent backdoor or remote code execution mechanism, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the compromised system by running the specified Python script. The code operates silently, suppressing exceptions, and modifies user environment files without explicit user consent, which are common traits of malicious activity.",
