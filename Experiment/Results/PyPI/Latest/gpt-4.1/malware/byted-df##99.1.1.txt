      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then makes an HTTP request to this URL, including the current hostname and package name as query parameters. This behavior suggests the code is attempting to contact a remote server to possibly exfiltrate information or receive commands, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as command-and-control communication or data exfiltration. The use of an unverified SSL context further indicates an attempt to avoid SSL verification, which is common in malicious scripts to prevent detection or interference. Overall, this code exhibits typical traits of malicious behavior aimed at covertly communicating with an external server.",
