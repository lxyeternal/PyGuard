This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. Running external executables during package installation is a common tactic for malware or backdoors, especially if the executable's purpose is not transparent or verified. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by executing potentially harmful code during setup.",
