      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute automatically upon package installation, taking a screenshot of the user's screen and sending it to a remote Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes malicious activity because it captures potentially sensitive visual information without user consent and transmits it to an attacker-controlled server. Additionally, the code installs required packages silently, which could be used to further compromise the system or facilitate other malicious actions. Overall, the code's intent to secretly collect and exfiltrate user data without explicit permission classifies it as malicious.",
