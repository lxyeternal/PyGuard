      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that, upon package installation, sends an HTTP request to a specified webhook URL. This request includes the system's hostname and public IP address, effectively exfiltrating sensitive system information without user consent. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is characteristic of malicious activity, especially since it is embedded within a seemingly legitimate setup script. The use of a webhook URL and the collection of system details suggest malicious intent to monitor or identify infected systems.",
