      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that collect the user's public IP address and geolocation information, then send this data via a Telegram bot without user consent. Additionally, it makes requests to external servers with user input, potentially for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and server endpoints, combined with the unsolicited data collection and transmission, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at spying on users and exfiltrating data.",
