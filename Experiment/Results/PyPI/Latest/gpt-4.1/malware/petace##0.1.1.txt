      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then performs an HTTP request to this URL, appending the current hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is likely used for command-and-control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or tracking purposes. Such activity is characteristic of malicious scripts that attempt to secretly communicate with external servers, potentially to receive commands, send sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions. The obfuscation and silent network activity strongly indicate malicious intent.",
