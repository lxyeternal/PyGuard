      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code from 'main' can be run, which could be used to execute malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform other harmful actions without user awareness. The code's structure and the invocation of external code during setup indicate malicious intent, especially if the 'main' module contains malicious logic.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information to malicious servers.",
