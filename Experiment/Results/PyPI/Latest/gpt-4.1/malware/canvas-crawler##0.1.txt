This behavior is characteristic of a 'canary token' or 'ping' mechanism used to detect when the package is installed, potentially alerting an attacker or malicious actor. While the package claims to be harmless and only sends a notification, the act of silently exfiltrating system details without user consent is malicious and can be used for reconnaissance or tracking purposes.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP request to a canary token URL that includes the hostname and username of the machine executing the script. Canary tokens are typically used as traps to detect unauthorized access or code execution. By triggering this request upon import, the code effectively acts as a 'beacon' or 'spy' that notifies an external server when the script is run, potentially revealing sensitive environment details without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or at least intrusive tracking activity, as it can be used to monitor or confirm the presence of the script on a system without the user's knowledge.",
