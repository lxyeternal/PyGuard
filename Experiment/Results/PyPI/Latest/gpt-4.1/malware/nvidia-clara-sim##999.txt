      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function `custom_command()` that constructs a URL string and then dynamically executes it using `eval()`. The URL is assembled from obfuscated string parts, which suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose. When invoked, it likely performs a malicious action such as executing remote code or downloading and executing malicious payloads from an external server. The code is integrated into standard setup commands (`install`, `develop`, `egg_info`), meaning this malicious behavior is triggered during typical package installation or development setup processes. This pattern is characteristic of malicious Python code designed to infect systems or execute harmful operations covertly.",
