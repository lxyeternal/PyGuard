      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior effectively sets up a persistent backdoor or remote code execution mechanism, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by running the shell command. The code operates silently, with exception handling that suppresses errors, making it difficult for users to detect or prevent this malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits clear malicious intent by establishing persistent remote access and executing arbitrary code without user consent.",
