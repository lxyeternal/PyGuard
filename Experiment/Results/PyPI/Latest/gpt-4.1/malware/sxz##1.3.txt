      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded ZIP archive containing a malicious payload, writes it to a file named '.Devil', and then executes it using Python. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently deploy and run malicious code on the host system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encoded archives and automatic execution without user consent strongly suggests malicious intent.",
