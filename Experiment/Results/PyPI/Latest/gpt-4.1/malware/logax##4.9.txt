      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated logic that retrieves a URL and filename via base64-encoded strings, downloads a file from the URL, executes it, and then deletes it. This pattern indicates an attempt to execute remote code or payloads stealthily, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as malware downloaders or backdoors. The obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest intent to evade detection and perform harmful actions on the host system.",
