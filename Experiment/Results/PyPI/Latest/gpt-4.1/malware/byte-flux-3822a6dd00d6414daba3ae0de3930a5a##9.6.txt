      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code on the target system. The presence of such a pattern indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads within the installation routine, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or system compromise.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and current working directory, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to secretly gather and transmit potentially identifying information for malicious purposes.",
