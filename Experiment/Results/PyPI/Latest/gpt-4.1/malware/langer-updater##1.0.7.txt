This behavior can be exploited to run arbitrary code embedded within the ZIP file, potentially allowing malicious payloads to execute on the target system. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code, as it bypasses normal code review and can conceal harmful activities. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the package itself, further indicating malicious intent.",
