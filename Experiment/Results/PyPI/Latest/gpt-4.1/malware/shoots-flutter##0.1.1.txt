      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then makes an HTTP request to this URL, including the local hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is attempting to contact a remote server without user knowledge, potentially for malicious purposes such as command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or tracking. The use of an unverified SSL context further indicates an intent to connect to potentially malicious or untrusted servers, bypassing SSL security checks. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious or suspicious activity, including obfuscation, hidden communication, and potential data leakage.",
