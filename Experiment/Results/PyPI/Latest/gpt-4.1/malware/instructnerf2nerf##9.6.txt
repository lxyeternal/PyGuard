      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (`CrazyInstallStrat`) that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a `main()` function from an external module named `main`. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The `main()` function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. This pattern is commonly used in malicious Python packages to hide malicious payloads within setup scripts, making the code potentially harmful.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system details to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as profiling, surveillance, or further exploitation.",
