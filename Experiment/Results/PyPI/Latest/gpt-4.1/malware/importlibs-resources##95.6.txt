This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which could be used to run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform other harmful actions without the user's knowledge. The presence of such code indicates an attempt to embed malicious behavior into the package installation routine.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming the malicious intent.",
