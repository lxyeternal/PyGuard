      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains two separate payloads designed to execute potentially harmful actions. On Windows systems, it decodes a base64-encoded PowerShell script that writes a PowerShell script file to the user's appdata directory, executes it, and then deletes the script file. The base64 string likely encodes malicious commands, such as downloading or executing further payloads. On POSIX systems, it downloads an executable binary from a remote URL, sets its permissions to be executable, and runs it in the background, which could be used to install malware or perform unauthorized activities. Both behaviors are characteristic of malicious code aimed at executing arbitrary commands, downloading malicious payloads, or establishing persistence, thus classifying this code as malicious.",
