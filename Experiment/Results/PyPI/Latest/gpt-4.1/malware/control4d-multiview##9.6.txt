      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or remote control. The code's structure and the invocation of external code during setup are common tactics used to conceal malicious activities, making this code potentially malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to potentially malicious servers.",
