      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically constructed Python code that appears designed to execute hidden or malicious payloads. It uses complex string manipulations, dynamic attribute access, and indirect imports to conceal its true intent. The presence of large, seemingly random data blobs and the use of obfuscation techniques strongly suggest it is intended to hide malicious behavior, such as downloading, executing, or exfiltrating data, or executing malicious code without detection. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, aiming to evade static analysis and execute harmful actions.",
