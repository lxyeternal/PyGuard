      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, executes a system command to create an empty file at /tmp/ran. While this action alone may seem benign, it is often used as a marker or trigger for malicious activities such as signaling that the malware has been installed, or as part of a larger malicious payload. The use of os.system to execute a shell command during installation is suspicious, especially if the purpose of the file creation is unclear or if the code is distributed from untrusted sources. This behavior indicates an attempt to perform an action outside the normal scope of package installation, which can be considered malicious or at least suspicious.",
