      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors indicative of a credential-stealing malware or information stealer. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Data Collection of Sensitive Information:**\n   - Extracts Discord tokens from local storage files, which can be used to hijack user accounts.\n   - Retrieves saved browser passwords from Chrome's local database, potentially exposing user credentials.\n   - Reads configuration files from popular Minecraft launchers (ATLauncher and LunarClient), potentially capturing account credentials.\n   - Gathers system information such as username, computer name, hardware ID, and public IP address.\n\n2. **Data Exfiltration:**\n   - Sends all collected data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request to a URL decoded from a base64 string, which is likely controlled by the attacker.\n   - The data is formatted and sent in a way that suggests it is meant for malicious collection and analysis.\n\n3. **Stealth and Evasion:**\n   - Uses obfuscated URL (base64-encoded) to hide the destination.\n   - Reads sensitive data from various locations without user consent.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to silently collect sensitive user data and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server, which is characteristic of malicious malware or spyware. This behavior is highly malicious and intended for unauthorized data theft.",
