      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior effectively executes remote code on the user's machine without explicit consent, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The purpose appears to be to establish persistence and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to remote command execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
