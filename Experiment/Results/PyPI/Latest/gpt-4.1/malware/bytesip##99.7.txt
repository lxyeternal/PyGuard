      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing unwanted operations. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity within the setup process, making it potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or used for data exfiltration. This behavior indicates an attempt to gather and transmit potentially sensitive user and system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or reconnaissance.",
