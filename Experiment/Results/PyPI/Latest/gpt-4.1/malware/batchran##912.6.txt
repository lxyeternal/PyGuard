This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during the package installation process. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, download malware, or perform other harmful actions without the user's knowledge or consent. The code's structure and the timing of executing external code during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
