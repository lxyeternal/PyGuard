      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information, including public IP address, geographic location, and potentially sensitive data such as username and system details. It then transmits this data to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The presence of functions that gather system info and send it to an external URL, combined with the context of the package description labeling it as 'malicious' and for 'research purposes only,' strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code structure suggests it could execute malicious actions upon installation or execution, such as data exfiltration, without user consent. Overall, this code exhibits typical behaviors of malware or spyware aimed at unauthorized surveillance and data theft.",
