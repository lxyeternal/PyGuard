It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL, which could be used for unauthorized data exfiltration or surveillance. The use of system commands to gather environment details and the transmission of this data to an external service without user consent indicates malicious intent, especially since it operates covertly during package installation.",
