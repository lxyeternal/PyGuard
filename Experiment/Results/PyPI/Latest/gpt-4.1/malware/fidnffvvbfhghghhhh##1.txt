      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a`). This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials (Google Cloud access tokens) to an attacker-controlled server. Embedding such token theft within setup or development commands is a common tactic for malicious actors to stealthily harvest credentials during package installation or development processes. Therefore, the code exhibits malicious intent aimed at unauthorized data exfiltration.",
