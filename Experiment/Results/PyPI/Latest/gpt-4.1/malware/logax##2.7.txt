      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or transparency. It decodes a base64-encoded URL, retrieves a file from that URL, saves it locally, and then executes it via an os.system call. This pattern is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code manipulates a license file and appends specific markers, which could be used for persistence or anti-analysis measures. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent and functionality.",
