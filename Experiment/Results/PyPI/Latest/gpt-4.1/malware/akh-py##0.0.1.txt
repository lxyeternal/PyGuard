      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to contact an external server via an HTTP GET request to a canarytokens.com URL, which is typically used for tracking or triggering alerts when the code runs. This behavior suggests the code is designed to detect if it is being executed in a sandbox or analysis environment, or to notify an attacker of its execution. Additionally, commented-out code indicates an intention to send system information (such as OS details and current directory) to a Discord webhook, which could be used for exfiltration of system data. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious or potentially malicious scripts used for reconnaissance, tracking, or data exfiltration.",
