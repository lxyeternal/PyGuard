It then attempts to execute this script by adding a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently execute arbitrary code or malicious payloads on the victim's machine, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The code's primary purpose appears to be to silently install and execute potentially malicious code without user consent, classifying it as malicious.",
