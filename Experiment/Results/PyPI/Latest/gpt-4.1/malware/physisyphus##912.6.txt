      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, during the installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon package installation. Such behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during setup, potentially leading to malware installation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities without user consent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, suggesting the script is designed to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information covertly.",
