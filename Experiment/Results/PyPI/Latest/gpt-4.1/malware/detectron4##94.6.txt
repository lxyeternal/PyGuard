      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or compromising the system. This pattern is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or user-beneficial functions and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to potentially malicious servers.",
