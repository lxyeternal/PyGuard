      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a function called `collect_data` during the installation process of the package. This function is imported from `ironic_secureboot_driver.main` and is also set as a command-line entry point. The purpose of collecting and potentially transmitting system information without explicit user consent or awareness indicates malicious intent. Such behavior can be used for unauthorized data collection, surveillance, or other malicious activities, especially if the `collect_data` function gathers sensitive information or communicates with external servers. The integration of this function into the installation process suggests an attempt to run malicious code covertly during package setup, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",
