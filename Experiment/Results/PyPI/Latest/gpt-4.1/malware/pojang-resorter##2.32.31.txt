      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern is typical of malware attempting to hide its true intent by hiding the payload through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation. The payload likely performs harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or remote command execution. The use of dynamic code execution and layered decoding strongly indicates malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory, which is suspicious behavior. The executable's name suggests it may be a Windows-specific binary, and its execution could be used to run malicious payloads or malware. Additionally, the code logs the process and executes the file without any user confirmation or validation, indicating potential malicious intent to silently run harmful code. The use of random status codes and lack of transparency further suggest malicious activity aimed at executing arbitrary or harmful code on the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses base64 decoding, string reversal, and zlib decompression to hide its true intent. The payload, once decoded and decompressed, is executed via `exec()`, which is a common technique for running malicious code. This pattern indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system resources, potentially leading to malware infection, data theft, or unauthorized access. Overall, this code is malicious and intended for harmful activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to execute potentially harmful scripts or functions based on command-line input. Notably, it includes a command 'nukeserver' which directly calls a function 'nukeserver()' imported from an external module, suggesting destructive behavior such as server destruction or data wiping. Additionally, the 'assign_operator' command invokes a function 'assign_operator' from an external module, which could be used to escalate privileges or control. The script dynamically executes other Python scripts ('init_bot.py', 'do_snapshot.py', 'show_help.py') without validation, which could be exploited to run malicious code. Overall, the presence of a command explicitly named 'nukeserver' and the ability to execute arbitrary scripts or functions indicates malicious intent or behavior, potentially aimed at damaging or compromising systems.",
