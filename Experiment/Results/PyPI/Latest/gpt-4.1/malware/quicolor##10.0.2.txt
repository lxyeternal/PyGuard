      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden functionality designed to exfiltrate user data from Telegram Desktop by compressing the Telegram data directory and uploading it to a Telegram chat via a bot API. This behavior is concealed within functions that appear to be for color formatting and utility purposes, making it less obvious to casual inspection. The code also installs signal handlers and spawns watcher processes to ensure the data upload completes even if the main program terminates. Such activity is characteristic of malicious data theft or espionage, especially since it targets user-specific application data without explicit user consent or notification.",
