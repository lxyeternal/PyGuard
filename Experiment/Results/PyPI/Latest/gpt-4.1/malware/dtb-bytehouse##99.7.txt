      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code from 'main' can be run, which could be used to execute malicious payloads, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or performing other harmful actions. The code's structure indicates an intent to run potentially malicious code automatically during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
