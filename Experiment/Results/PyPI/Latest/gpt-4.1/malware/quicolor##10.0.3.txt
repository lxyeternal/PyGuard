It employs background threads, signal handlers, and process watchers to ensure the data transfer completes even if the main program exits prematurely. This behavior is concealed within a seemingly benign color formatting utility, indicating an intent to surreptitiously collect and transmit sensitive user information, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
