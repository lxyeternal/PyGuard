It decodes base64-encoded URLs and file paths, then attempts to read a file from the local filesystem whose path is determined dynamically from the decoded content. Subsequently, it sends the contents of this file via an HTTP POST request to a remote server. This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive or configuration data from the compromised system to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding for URLs and file paths, along with the dynamic file reading and network transmission, are common techniques in malicious scripts aimed at data theft or command-and-control communication.",
