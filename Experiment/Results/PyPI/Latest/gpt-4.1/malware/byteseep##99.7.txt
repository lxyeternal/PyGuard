      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or modifying system files. This pattern is commonly used in malicious Python packages to execute harmful code during installation, making this code potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to external URLs with this data embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with malicious or malicious-like activity (e.g., oast domains used for security testing or command-and-control). This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as spyware, malware, or command-and-control communication. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and is designed to secretly transmit system information to external servers, confirming its malicious intent.",
