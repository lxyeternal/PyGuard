      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation script that, during package installation, constructs a string based on the current user's login name and system hostname, encodes it in base64, and then performs a DNS lookup to a domain that appears to be controlled by an attacker. This DNS query likely serves as a covert channel or beacon to exfiltrate or signal information about the infected host to an attacker-controlled server. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used for tracking, command-and-control communication, or data exfiltration without the user's knowledge.",
