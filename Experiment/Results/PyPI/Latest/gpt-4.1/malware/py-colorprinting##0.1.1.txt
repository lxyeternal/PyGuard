      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from an external URL, extracts its contents, and executes an executable file ('ore-miner.exe') from the extracted files without any validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver and run malware on the victim's system. The use of a seemingly innocuous URL, combined with silent download and execution, suggests an intent to conceal malicious payloads and compromise the host system.",
