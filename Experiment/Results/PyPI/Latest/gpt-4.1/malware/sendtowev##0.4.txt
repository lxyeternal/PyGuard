      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a highly sophisticated information stealer and remote data exfiltration tool. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- Collects sensitive user data from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.), including passwords, cookies, credit card info, autofill data, browsing history, and bookmarks.\n- Extracts Discord tokens, user account details, friends list, guild memberships, Nitro gift codes, and other personal information.\n- Gathers system information such as IP address, geolocation, and environment details.\n- Checks for virtual machine or debugger detection to evade analysis.\n- Uploads stolen data to external file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io) and sends the information to a Discord webhook.\n- Attempts to find and exfiltrate wallet data from cryptocurrency applications.\n- Searches user directories for files containing keywords related to passwords, tokens, and sensitive data.\n- Kills certain processes related to debugging or analysis tools.\n\nOverall, the script is designed to stealthily harvest a wide range of personal and sensitive data from infected systems and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers, indicating malicious intent.",
