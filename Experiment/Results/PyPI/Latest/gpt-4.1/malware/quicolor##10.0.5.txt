      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden mechanisms to exfiltrate user data by compressing and uploading Telegram data folders to an external Telegram bot, effectively stealing private chat histories and media. It employs covert background threads and subprocesses to perform these actions silently, even when the main program terminates. The code also manipulates signal handlers and registers cleanup routines to ensure the data upload completes, indicating an intent to persist and operate stealthily. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious data theft and unauthorized surveillance.",
