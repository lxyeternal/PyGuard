      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a malicious payload during installation by capturing a screenshot of the user's screen and sending it to an external Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized surveillance and data exfiltration, violating user privacy. The script also installs required packages silently, which could be used to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the code's primary purpose appears to be spying on the user without consent, making it malicious.",
