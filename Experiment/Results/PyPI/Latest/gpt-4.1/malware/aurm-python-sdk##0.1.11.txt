      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and saves it as '~/.fleetwood.py'. It then appends a command ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior indicates an attempt to execute remote code on the user's machine automatically upon installation, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The code could be used to run arbitrary code, potentially leading to remote command execution, data theft, or system compromise. Such actions are highly suspicious and typically malicious.",
