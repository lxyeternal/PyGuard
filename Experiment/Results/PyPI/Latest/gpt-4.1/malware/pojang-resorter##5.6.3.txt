      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system resources or data. This pattern is typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to evade detection and execute harmful actions on the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory, which is suspicious behavior. The executable's name suggests it may be a Windows-specific binary, potentially malicious. The script does not perform any legitimate or safe operations; instead, it silently runs an external executable without user consent or validation, which could be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. Additionally, the use of logging and random status codes appears to mask or obfuscate the true intent, further indicating malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to install and execute a file named 'pojangsetup.exe' from a 'libs' directory, adding a shortcut to the Windows startup folder to ensure persistent execution. This behavior suggests an intent to maintain persistent presence on the infected system, which is characteristic of malware. The executable's name and the act of adding it to startup without user consent are common tactics used by malicious actors to establish persistence and potentially perform malicious activities such as remote control, data theft, or other harmful operations.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to execute potentially harmful scripts or functions remotely or locally, including a command named 'nukeserver' which suggests destructive behavior. The 'nukeserver' command imports and calls a function from 'nukeserver.py', which, based on its name, likely performs destructive actions such as deleting data, shutting down servers, or causing damage. Additionally, the code can execute arbitrary scripts like 'init_bot', 'do_snapshot', 'show_help', and 'forceop', which could be used for malicious purposes such as unauthorized control, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The presence of a command that explicitly references 'nukeserver' strongly indicates malicious intent, especially if used without proper authorization or context. Overall, the code's structure and command options suggest it is intended for malicious control or destruction of systems.",
