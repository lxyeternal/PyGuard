      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation script that, upon execution, retrieves the current system's hostname and username, encodes this information in base64, and constructs a domain name with this encoded data. It then performs a DNS lookup (`nslookup`) on this dynamically generated domain. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking, as it sends system-specific information to an external server controlled by an attacker. The use of `os.popen` to execute a command that contacts an external domain indicates malicious intent, potentially for reconnaissance, data theft, or establishing a backdoor connection.",
