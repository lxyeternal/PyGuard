The package description labels it as a 'Malicious backdoor package', indicating malicious intent. Such a package could be used to distribute malicious code or backdoors under the guise of a legitimate package. The high version number and the description suggest an attempt to deceive users or package repositories, potentially leading to the installation of harmful code or backdoors on victim systems.",

Additionally, there are commented-out lines indicating the intention to collect and exfiltrate system information (hostname, IP address, username) to the attacker's server. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at gaining unauthorized access and control over the target machine.",
