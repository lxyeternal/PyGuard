      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process, which can be used to execute arbitrary code without the user's knowledge or consent. This behavior is suspicious because it bypasses standard package installation procedures and can be exploited to run malicious payloads. The use of zipimport and importlib to load code from an external archive indicates an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious activities, such as executing malicious scripts or payloads embedded within 'my.zip'.",
