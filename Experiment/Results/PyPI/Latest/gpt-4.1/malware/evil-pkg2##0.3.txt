Additionally, it sets up a package named 'evil-pkg2' with a description that appears harmless but could be used to distribute malicious payloads or backdoors. The combination of making an external request to a potentially malicious server and installing a package with a suspicious name indicates malicious intent, such as exfiltrating data, downloading further malicious payloads, or establishing persistence.",
