      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, during the installation process, imports a module named 'main' and executes its 'm()' function. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code at install time, which could be used to run malicious payloads, download malware, or perform other harmful actions without user consent. The code does not reveal what 'main.m()' does, but executing code during installation is a common tactic in malicious packages to compromise systems or perform unauthorized activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It then encodes this data and sends it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated using base64 encoding, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. This behavior suggests data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity, such as spyware or backdoor communication. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting potentially sensitive information, confirming its malicious nature.",
