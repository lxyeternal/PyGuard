      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior bypasses static code analysis and normal package distribution mechanisms, potentially allowing an attacker to embed and execute malicious payloads on the target system without explicit user consent. The use of zipimport to load code from an external archive during setup is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, especially if the contents of 'my.zip' are controlled by an attacker.",
