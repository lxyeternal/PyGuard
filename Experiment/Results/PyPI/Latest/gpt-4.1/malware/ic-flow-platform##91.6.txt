      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity behind the setup process, making it potentially malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit potentially identifying information for malicious purposes.",
