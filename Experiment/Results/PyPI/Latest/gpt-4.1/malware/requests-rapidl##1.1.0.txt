It does not collect passwords but explicitly states that it does not do so to avoid legal issues. The collection and transmission of user data during package installation, especially without clear disclosure or user approval, constitutes malicious behavior, as it can be used for unauthorized surveillance, data theft, or other malicious purposes.",
