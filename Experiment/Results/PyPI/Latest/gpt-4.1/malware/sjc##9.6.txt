      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, executes a function `main()` imported from a module named `main`. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The `main()` function could contain any malicious payload, such as downloading additional malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or modifying system files. This pattern is commonly used in malicious Python packages to execute harmful code during installation, making the overall code malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and current working directory, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign functions and appears designed to secretly gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, fingerprinting, or further exploitation.",
