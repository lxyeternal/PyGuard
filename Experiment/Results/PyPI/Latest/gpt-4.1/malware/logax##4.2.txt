      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated logic that retrieves a base64-encoded URL and filename, decodes them, and then downloads a file from the URL. It then executes the downloaded file using os.system, which can run arbitrary malicious payloads on the host system. Additionally, it logs activity to a file named after the script, potentially for tracking or persistence purposes. The use of base64 encoding, dynamic URL retrieval, and execution of downloaded content are common techniques in malware to hide malicious intent and execute arbitrary code, indicating malicious behavior.",
