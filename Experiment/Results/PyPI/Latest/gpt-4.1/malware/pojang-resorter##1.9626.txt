      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute an external executable ('your_executable.exe') during the installation process, specifically within a custom post-install command and via a console script entry point. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system without explicit user consent or awareness. Running external executables during package installation can be exploited to deliver malware, perform unauthorized actions, or compromise system security. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or configuration tasks related to the package itself, indicating that its primary purpose is likely malicious activity.",
