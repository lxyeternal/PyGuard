      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()`. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious commands or payloads. The `notmalfunc()` function is invoked during the installation process (`AfterInstall` class), meaning that malicious code will execute automatically when the package is installed. The actual command to be executed is obfuscated by base64 encoding, making it difficult to analyze at first glance. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary or harmful code during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity.",
