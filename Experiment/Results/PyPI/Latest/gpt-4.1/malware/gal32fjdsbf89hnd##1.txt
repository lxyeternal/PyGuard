      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials (Google Cloud access tokens) to an attacker-controlled server. The function is invoked during the installation, development, and egg info commands, meaning it will run whenever the package is installed or developed, potentially without user awareness. This pattern is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at stealing cloud credentials for unauthorized access or further exploitation.",
