      "malicious_behavior": "The code installs a custom setup process that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port (192.168.239.158:1234). It constructs a Python command that creates a socket connection back to the attacker's machine, redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, spawns a bash shell, and then closes the socket. This behavior effectively grants remote control over the compromised system to an attacker, which is a clear malicious activity designed for unauthorized access and potential exploitation.",
