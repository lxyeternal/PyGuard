      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payload execution logic that is only triggered on Windows systems. It decrypts and decompresses a large, complex payload using multiple layers of encoding, cryptographic operations, and compression, then executes it dynamically via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoor functionality, as it aims to hide malicious code from static analysis and execute potentially harmful actions at runtime. The code also checks for debugging or analysis environments, which further indicates malicious intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to run hidden, encrypted malicious payloads, making it highly malicious.",
