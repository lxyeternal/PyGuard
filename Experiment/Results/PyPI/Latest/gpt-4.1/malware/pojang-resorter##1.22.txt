      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon package installation, attempts to execute an external executable file ('your_executable.exe') located within the installed package directory. This behavior is suspicious because it automatically runs an external program without user consent or explicit permission, which can be used to execute malicious payloads, malware, or unwanted software on the user's system. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions after installation.",
