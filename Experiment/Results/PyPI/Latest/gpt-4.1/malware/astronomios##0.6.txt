      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted logic that, upon execution, decrypts and runs hidden payloads. It performs environment checks (such as detecting debuggers, virtual machines, or analysis tools) and terminates if suspicious conditions are met. The core payload is encrypted with multiple layers (base64, LZMA, AES, ChaCha20, and custom hashing), making it difficult to analyze statically. This behavior suggests the code is designed to evade detection, potentially to execute malicious activities such as malware installation, data exfiltration, or remote command execution. The use of cryptographic techniques, environment checks, and the dynamic execution of decrypted code strongly indicates malicious intent.",
