      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, during the installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module 'main'. This behavior suggests that the code is designed to run arbitrary or potentially malicious code at install time, which is a common tactic used by malicious packages to execute payloads without user awareness. The code does not perform any obvious legitimate setup tasks beyond this, and the invocation of an external 'main' function during installation is suspicious, indicating malicious intent to execute hidden or harmful code during package installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or user-beneficial functions and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, profiling, or further exploitation.",
