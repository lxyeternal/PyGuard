      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior effectively sets up persistent execution of remote code whenever the user opens a terminal session, enabling remote command execution or malware persistence. Such actions are characteristic of malicious activity, as they compromise user control and security by executing arbitrary code from an external source without user consent.",
