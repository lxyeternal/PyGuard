      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to exploit a known vulnerability by making an HTTP GET request to an external URL (likely a canarytoken or burp collaborator URL) which can be used to detect if the code has been executed in a target environment. Additionally, the code contains commented-out lines intended to send system information (OS details and current working directory) to a Discord webhook, which could be used for reconnaissance or exfiltration of environment data. The presence of these behaviors indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution (RCE) and information gathering, which are typical in malicious scripts designed for exploitation or surveillance.",
