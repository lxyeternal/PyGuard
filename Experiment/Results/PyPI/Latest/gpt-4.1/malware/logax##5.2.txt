      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden functionality that downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or transparency. Specifically, it decodes a base64-encoded URL pointing to a potentially malicious resource, downloads a file from that URL, and then executes it immediately. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code from an external source, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware deployment, or backdoor installation. Additionally, the code writes a marker ('#[//]') into an __init__.py file within the 'logax' package directory, which could be used to identify infected environments or maintain persistent malicious behavior. Overall, the code's actions—downloading, executing external code, and covertly modifying files—are typical malicious behaviors designed to compromise the host system.",
