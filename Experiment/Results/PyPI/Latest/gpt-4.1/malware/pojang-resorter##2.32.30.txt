      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated, indicating an intent to hide malicious intent. Such behavior is typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to run hidden or harmful code on the target system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory, which is suspicious behavior. The executable's name suggests it may be a Windows-specific binary, and its execution could be used to run malicious payloads, malware, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system. Additionally, the code does not perform any legitimate or safe operations beyond executing this external file, and the use of subprocess.run without validation or restrictions indicates potential malicious intent. Overall, this code appears designed to silently execute potentially harmful code, making it malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses base64 decoding, string reversal, and zlib decompression to hide its true intent. When executed, it likely retrieves or executes malicious code, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to execute potentially harmful scripts or functions based on command-line input. Notably, it can invoke a 'nukeserver' function from an external module, which by its name suggests destructive behavior such as deleting or damaging server data. Additionally, the 'assign_operator' command imports and executes a function from an external module, which could be used to escalate privileges or take control of a system. The code's structure allows for dynamic execution of scripts and functions that could be malicious if misused, especially given the presence of commands like 'nukeserver' and 'forceop'. Overall, the script facilitates remote or command-line triggered malicious actions, indicating it is malicious.",
