      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Specifically, it performs the following suspicious actions:\n\n1. **Sleep Delay:** It introduces a 5-second delay at startup (`__import__('time').sleep(5)`), which can be used to evade quick detection or to synchronize malicious activities.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Decoding and Execution:** It decodes a large base64-encoded string, which is further transformed through XOR operations with the value 3, and then executes the resulting code via `exec()`. This obfuscation makes it difficult to analyze the payload directly and suggests an intent to hide malicious code.\n\n3. **Potential Malicious Payload:** The decoded code likely contains malicious behavior such as establishing unauthorized network connections, data exfiltration, or executing arbitrary commands, which are typical in malware or backdoors.\n\nOverall, the combination of obfuscation, delayed execution, and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious intent. The code is designed to hide its true purpose and execute potentially harmful actions on the host system.",
