      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden mechanisms to exfiltrate Telegram chat data by compressing the user's Telegram data folder and uploading it to an external Telegram bot controlled by an attacker. It employs background threads and detached processes to perform these actions covertly, even when the main application terminates. The script also logs detailed information about its operations, including process start times, file sizes, and errors, which can be used for debugging or tracking. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious data theft and unauthorized surveillance, indicating that the code is intentionally designed to compromise user privacy without consent.",
