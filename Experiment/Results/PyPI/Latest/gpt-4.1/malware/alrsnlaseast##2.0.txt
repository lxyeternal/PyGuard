      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to detect if the 'torchvision' module is installed, and if so, it executes a shell command that fetches a script from a remote server (http://43.155.40.182:8080/favicon.txt) and pipes it directly into bash for execution. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, as it involves remote code execution without any validation or user consent. The remote server could deliver any malicious payload, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
