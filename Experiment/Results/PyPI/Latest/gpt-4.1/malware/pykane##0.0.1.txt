This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. The lack of user prompts, the silent execution, and the external download from an untrusted source strongly suggest malicious intent.",

This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. The process of downloading and executing an unknown executable from the internet without validation or user approval is a common tactic in malware distribution and indicates malicious intent.",
