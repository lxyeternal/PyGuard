      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string stored in the variable __safety_token__, which decodes to a URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z') and appears to be used for retrieving external content. This pattern is often associated with malicious scripts that fetch and execute remote payloads, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The presence of such encoded data and the reference to an external URL strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since the code does not perform any meaningful operations beyond storing this encoded string.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and starts a new thread that executes the result of the function 't' called with '__safety_token__' as an argument. Since 't' and '__safety_token__' are imported from a local module, their contents are unknown, but the pattern suggests that 't(__safety_token__)' likely returns malicious code or a payload that is executed immediately in a separate thread. This behavior is characteristic of obfuscated or malicious scripts aiming to run hidden or unauthorized code without detection, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful activities.",
