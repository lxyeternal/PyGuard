      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute potentially malicious payloads during the package installation process, making it malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs appear to be command-and-control or data collection endpoints, and the code does not perform any legitimate or benign function. Therefore, it is classified as malicious.",
