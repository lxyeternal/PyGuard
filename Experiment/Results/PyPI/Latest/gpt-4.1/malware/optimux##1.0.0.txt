This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it secretly collects and exfiltrates user environment data without user consent, potentially enabling malicious actors to track or identify the system. The use of os.system to run a curl command embedded with shell variable expansions further indicates an intent to gather and transmit private information surreptitiously.",
