      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code on the target system. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data, making this code potentially harmful.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting potentially private information, suggesting it is designed for malicious purposes such as tracking, espionage, or unauthorized surveillance.",
