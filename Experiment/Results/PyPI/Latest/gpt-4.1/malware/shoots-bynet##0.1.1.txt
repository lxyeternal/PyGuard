      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then performs an HTTP request to this URL, appending the current hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is attempting to contact an external server covertly, potentially to exfiltrate information (such as the hostname) or to receive commands. The use of base64 encoding and unverified SSL context further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure the connection succeeds even if the server's SSL certificate is invalid. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or suspicious activity, such as command-and-control communication or data exfiltration.",
