      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be hidden within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during the package installation process. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, malware, or backdoors without user awareness, making it potentially harmful. The code's primary purpose appears to be to execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, further confirming malicious intent.",
