It decodes a list of integers into a script, writes it to a temporary file, and then executes it via a base64-decoded command piped directly into bash. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code, likely a reverse shell or other malicious payload, without user consent. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and base64 encoding are common techniques to hide malicious intent, confirming that this code is malicious.",
