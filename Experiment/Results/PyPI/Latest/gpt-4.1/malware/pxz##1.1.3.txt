This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The use of a private IP address suggests it is intended for an attacker-controlled server, further confirming malicious intent. Although the code appears to be packaged as a legitimate Python package, the primary purpose is to surreptitiously gather and send system information, which is a common tactic in malware or spyware.",
