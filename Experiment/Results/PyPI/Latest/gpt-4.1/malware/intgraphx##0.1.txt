      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to dynamically import 'zlib' and 'base64', then reverses and decodes a base64-encoded string, decompresses it, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or manipulating files, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful actions. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and executing concealed malicious code.",
