      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a specific URL during the package setup process. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, such as tracking, exfiltration, or triggering malicious payloads without user consent. The request occurs immediately upon installation, which can be used to identify or compromise systems without the user's knowledge. Additionally, the package description references a 'Dependency confusion Attack' and a 'Remote code execution (RCE)' vulnerability, suggesting malicious intent or exploitation potential.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to perform remote code execution (RCE) by making an HTTP GET request to an external URL, which is likely a canarytoken or Burp Collaborator URL. Such URLs are commonly used to detect when a target system runs the code, indicating potential malicious activity or reconnaissance. Additionally, the commented-out code suggests an intent to gather system information (OS details and current directory) and send it to a Discord webhook, which could be used for exfiltration of sensitive data. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed for reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or triggering remote actions without user consent.",
