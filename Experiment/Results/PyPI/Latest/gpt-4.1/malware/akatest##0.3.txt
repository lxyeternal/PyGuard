This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data or notify an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as command-and-control communication or data exfiltration. The use of subprocess to invoke curl indicates an intent to perform network operations outside the normal Python environment, which can be a red flag for malicious intent.",
