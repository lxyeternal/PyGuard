      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation class that, during the package installation process, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is indicative of malicious activity because it exfiltrates user and system data without user consent, potentially for malicious purposes such as profiling, tracking, or further exploitation. The code does not perform any legitimate installation-related functions with this data, suggesting intent to covertly gather information, which classifies it as malicious.",
