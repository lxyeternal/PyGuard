      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The code does not reveal what 'main' does, but executing code from an external module during setup is a common tactic to hide malicious activities. Therefore, this code is potentially malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system details, potentially for tracking, profiling, or malicious control purposes.",
