      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that, upon installation, sends an HTTP request to a specified webhook URL, including the system's hostname and public IP address. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of sensitive system information without user consent. The use of a webhook URL suggests an attacker could be collecting victim data remotely, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions related to the package's stated purpose, further supporting its malicious intent.",
