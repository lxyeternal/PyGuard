      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains behavior indicative of malicious activity, including downloading and executing external payloads. Specifically, it decodes base64-encoded URLs and filenames, retrieves a file from a remote server, saves it locally, and then executes it via os.system. This pattern suggests an attempt to fetch and run potentially harmful code from an external source, which is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks. Additionally, the code logs activity with timestamps, possibly to monitor or record its actions. Overall, these behaviors are typical of malicious scripts designed to compromise a system or execute arbitrary code.",
