This behavior indicates an attempt to download and execute potentially malicious payloads without user consent, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of 'wget' to fetch an external file and execute it silently is a common tactic in malware distribution.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote server (122.51.221.63/pytorch), makes it executable, and runs it in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading and executing malware, remote command execution, or establishing a backdoor. The use of 'nohup' and background execution further suggests an attempt to persist or operate covertly, indicating malicious intent.",
