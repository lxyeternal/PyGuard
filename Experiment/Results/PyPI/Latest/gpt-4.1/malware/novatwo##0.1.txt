Specifically, it fetches a script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt', decodes it, and decrypts it using a secret key embedded within the code. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the host system, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, backdooring, or data exfiltration.",
