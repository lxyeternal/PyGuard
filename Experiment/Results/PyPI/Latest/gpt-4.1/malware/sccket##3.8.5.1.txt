      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate files from the host system by uploading them to a remote Telegram bot. It scans the current directory and subdirectories for files (excluding ZIP files and previously sent files), then sends each file as a document to a specified Telegram chat. Additionally, it retrieves the device's hostname and IP address but does not utilize this information meaningfully. The core malicious behavior is the unauthorized collection and exfiltration of files, which can include sensitive data, to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot, indicating clear malicious intent.",
