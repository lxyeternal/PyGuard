This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading malware, remote access tools, or other harmful payloads. The environment variable check appears to be a simple anti-analysis or anti-sandbox measure, but the core behavior of fetching and executing external code without user consent is malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote server (122.51.221.63/pytorch), makes it executable, and runs it in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading and executing malware, remote command execution, or establishing a backdoor. The use of 'nohup' and background execution further suggests an attempt to persist or operate covertly, indicating malicious intent.",
