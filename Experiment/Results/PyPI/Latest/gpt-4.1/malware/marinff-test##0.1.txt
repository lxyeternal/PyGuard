      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP address and port. It encodes this command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via a shell, establishing a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior allows remote control over the compromised system, enabling malicious activities such as data theft, system manipulation, or further exploitation. The presence of hardcoded IP and port, combined with the automatic execution of a reverse shell during installation, clearly indicates malicious intent.",
