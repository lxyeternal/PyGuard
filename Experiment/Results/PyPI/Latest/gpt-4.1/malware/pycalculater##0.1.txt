      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed string, which likely contains malicious code. The payload is executed immediately via `exec()`, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code on the host system. This pattern is typical of malware that aims to hide its true intent through obfuscation and dynamic code execution, making it highly malicious and potentially harmful.",
