This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The code executes this data collection and transmission during the package installation process, which is deceptive and can occur without the user's knowledge or consent. Such behavior indicates malicious intent, as it compromises user privacy and security by secretly transmitting system details to an external entity.",
