      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code from 'main' can be executed without user consent or awareness. Such behavior can be exploited to run malicious payloads, install backdoors, or perform other harmful actions on the target system. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute potentially malicious code during the package installation process, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malicious package distribution.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming the malicious intent.",
