      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to secretly access specific directories on an Android device's storage (namely 'DCIM/Screenshots' and 'DCIM/Camera'), locate image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png), and upload these images to a remote Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as spyware or data theft. The code operates silently, with exception handling that suppresses errors, further suggesting an intent to avoid detection and maintain persistence.",
