      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `push_secrets` that reads AWS credentials from the user's local configuration file (`~/.aws/credentials`) and sends this sensitive information to an external URL specified by the environment variable `WEB_HOOK`. This behavior is highly malicious because it exfiltrates potentially critical security credentials without user consent, enabling unauthorized access to cloud resources, data theft, or further malicious activities. The code's primary purpose appears to be secret theft and data exfiltration, which classifies it as malicious.",
