      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP address and port. It encodes this command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via a shell, effectively establishing a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior allows remote control of the compromised system, enabling malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system manipulation. The presence of hardcoded IP and port, along with the reverse shell payload, clearly indicates malicious intent.",
