      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation script that, upon package installation, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it involves unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent, potentially enabling attackers to gather information about the target system for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance or further exploitation.",
