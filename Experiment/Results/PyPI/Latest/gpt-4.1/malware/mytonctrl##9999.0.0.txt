      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation class that, during the package installation process, exfiltrates sensitive system information—specifically the hostname, current working directory, and username—to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is covert and unauthorized, indicating malicious intent such as data theft or surveillance. The exfiltration occurs without user consent and is embedded within the setup script, which is a common tactic for malicious package distribution. Therefore, the code is malicious due to its unauthorized data exfiltration activity.",
