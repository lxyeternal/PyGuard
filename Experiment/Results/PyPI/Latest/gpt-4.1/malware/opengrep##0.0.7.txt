      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly collects system information such as the user ID and hostname and sends it to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration, which can be used for malicious purposes like reconnaissance, tracking, or unauthorized surveillance. The code also suppresses warnings and disables SSL verification, which are common tactics to hide malicious activity and avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to covertly gather and transmit sensitive system information without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
