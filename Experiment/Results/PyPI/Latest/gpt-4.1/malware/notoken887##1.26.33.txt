      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'pt()' that downloads an executable file ('sm.exe') from a remote URL ('https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe') and executes it on the host machine. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves retrieving and running potentially harmful software without user consent. Additionally, the code includes a 'TokenCryptor' class that performs simple character replacements to encode and decode strings, which could be used to obfuscate malicious payloads or communication. Overall, the code's primary malicious activity is the silent download and execution of a remote executable, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to encrypt Python source files and generate a separate script ('mainscript.pyw') that decrypts and executes the encrypted code at runtime. This behavior effectively obfuscates the original code, making static analysis difficult and enabling the execution of potentially malicious payloads without easy detection. The use of dynamic decryption and execution (via 'exec') can be exploited to hide malicious logic, payloads, or unauthorized actions, which is characteristic of malicious obfuscation techniques. Therefore, despite appearing as a legitimate encryption utility, its core functionality facilitates concealment and execution of hidden code, classifying it as malicious.",
