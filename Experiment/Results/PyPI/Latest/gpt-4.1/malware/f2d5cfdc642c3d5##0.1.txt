      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a command upon installation (via a custom setup command), which checks if the current user is not 'root'. If so, it gathers system information by running 'id' and collecting the directory tree of '/etc/', then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP PUT request to an external server ('blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com'). This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code's purpose appears to be to stealthily collect and transmit sensitive system information, potentially for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance or unauthorized data collection.",
