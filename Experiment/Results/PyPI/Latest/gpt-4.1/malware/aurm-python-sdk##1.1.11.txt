It then attempts to add a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior suggests an attempt to persist malicious code execution by automatically executing the downloaded script whenever a new shell session starts. Such actions can be used to establish persistent backdoors, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or package installation activities that justify this behavior, indicating it is malicious.",
