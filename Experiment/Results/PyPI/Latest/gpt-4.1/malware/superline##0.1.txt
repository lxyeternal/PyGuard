      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly sophisticated malware (trojan/spyware) designed to stealthily extract sensitive user data and system information. It performs numerous malicious activities including stealing browser credentials (passwords, cookies, history, autofills), harvesting Discord tokens, capturing webcam images, extracting system info, Wi-Fi passwords, and other personal files. It also injects malicious scripts into Discord applications, disables Windows Defender, blocks antivirus sites, and attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to escalate privileges. The malware then compresses all collected data into an archive, uploads it to external file hosting services, and reports the information via a webhook or Telegram bot, effectively exfiltrating private data and maintaining persistence on the infected system. Its behavior aims to compromise user privacy, facilitate account hijacking, and enable remote control or data theft, clearly classifying it as malicious.",
