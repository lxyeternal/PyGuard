      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during or immediately after installation, arbitrary code from 'main' can be executed without user consent or awareness. Such a pattern is often used by malicious actors to embed backdoors, payloads, or other harmful scripts that run automatically upon package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting potentially private information, suggesting it is designed for malicious purposes such as spying, data theft, or establishing a command-and-control channel.",
