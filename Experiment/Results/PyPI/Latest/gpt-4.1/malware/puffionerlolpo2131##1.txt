      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/c100b39f-8d06-40c4-bc5f-64e251fcc6ad`). This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates sensitive credentials (access tokens) from the environment to an attacker-controlled server, enabling unauthorized access or further malicious activities. The code is integrated into the setup process, meaning it will execute during installation, potentially without the user's knowledge or consent.",
