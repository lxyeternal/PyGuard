      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string stored in the variable __safety_token__, which decodes to a string that appears to be a URL or command related to remote control or data exfiltration. The presence of such encoded data suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as communicating with a command-and-control server or exfiltrating data. Although the code does not explicitly execute the decoded content, the obfuscation and the nature of the encoded string indicate malicious behavior, potentially used for malicious command execution or data theft.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and starts a new thread that executes the result of the function 't' called with '__safety_token__' as an argument. Since 't' and '__safety_token__' are imported from a local module, their contents are unknown, but the pattern suggests that 't(__safety_token__)' likely returns malicious code or a command. Executing this code in a separate thread without any validation or sanitization is highly suspicious and indicates an attempt to run potentially harmful code stealthily. This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary malicious payloads, evade detection, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system.",
