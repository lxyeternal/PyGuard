This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent, potentially for reconnaissance or tracking purposes. The use of a seemingly random or obfuscated URL further suggests malicious intent, especially since it is embedded within a package setup script, which is typically not expected to perform such actions.",
