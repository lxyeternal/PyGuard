Specifically, it constructs a URL string and uses shell commands to fetch and run code from that URL, redirecting output to suppress visibility. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
