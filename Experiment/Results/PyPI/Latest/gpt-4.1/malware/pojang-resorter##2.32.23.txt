      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon installation, attempts to execute an external Windows executable ('libs/windows.exe') located within the package's 'libs' subfolder. This behavior is suspicious because it involves running an arbitrary executable during installation, which could be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or perform malicious activities without user consent. The presence of such code suggests an intent to execute potentially harmful code post-installation, making the overall package potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern is typical of malware attempting to hide its true intent by hiding the payload through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation. The payload likely performs harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or remote command execution. Overall, this code is malicious due to its obfuscation and execution of hidden code, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.",

The obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as they are commonly used to evade detection and analysis.",
