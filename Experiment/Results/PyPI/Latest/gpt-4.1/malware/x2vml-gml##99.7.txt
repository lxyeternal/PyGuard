      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it will run arbitrary code from an external module, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads or establish unauthorized access on the target system. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with the imported 'main' function, indicating an intent to execute hidden or malicious code during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with malicious or suspicious activity (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This behavior suggests the code is designed to exfiltrate system information to remote servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance, tracking, or further exploitation. The use of random URL paths and the obfuscated nature of the request pattern further indicate malicious intent.",
