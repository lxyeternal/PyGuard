      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden functionality designed to exfiltrate user data from Telegram Desktop by compressing the Telegram data folder and uploading it to a Telegram chat via a bot API key. It employs covert techniques such as spawning background threads, creating detached processes, and registering cleanup handlers to ensure the data transfer occurs even if the main program terminates. The code also obfuscates its intent by embedding the data collection and upload logic within functions that are invoked indirectly, making it difficult for casual inspection. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious data theft and unauthorized surveillance, indicating that the code is malicious.",
