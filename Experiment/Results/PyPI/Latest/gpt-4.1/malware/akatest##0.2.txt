      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to send a GET request to a specified webhook URL using the 'curl' command executed via subprocess. This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data or notify an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as command-and-control communication or data leakage. The use of subprocess to invoke external commands for network communication is often associated with malicious scripts aiming to evade detection or perform covert operations. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its potential to send data or signals to an external entity without user consent.",
