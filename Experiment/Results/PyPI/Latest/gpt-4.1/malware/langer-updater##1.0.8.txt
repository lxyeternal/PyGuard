      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior bypasses standard package installation mechanisms and can conceal malicious payloads, making it potentially harmful. The use of zipimport to load code from an external archive and executing a function ('hello') from it indicates an intent to run code that is not part of the original package, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide malicious payloads.",
