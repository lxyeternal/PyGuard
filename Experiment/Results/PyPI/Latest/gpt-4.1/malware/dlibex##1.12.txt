      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a remote URL ('https://blockatlaspro.com/testupp.py'), saves it to a system directory within the user's AppData folder with a unique filename, sets the file attribute to hidden, and then executes it silently. This behavior indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious code without user awareness or consent, which is characteristic of malware or malicious payload delivery. The use of hidden files and silent execution further suggests malicious intent to evade detection and persistence.",
