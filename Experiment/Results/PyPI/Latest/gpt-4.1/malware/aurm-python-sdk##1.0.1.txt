It then attempts to execute this script by appending a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior can lead to arbitrary code execution, persistent backdoors, or data exfiltration, especially since the downloaded content is not verified or sandboxed. Such actions are characteristic of malicious activity, as they enable remote code execution and persistence without user consent or awareness.",
