      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. This pattern is often used in malicious Python packages to execute harmful code during installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or used for data exfiltration. The purpose of this behavior is to secretly gather and transmit user and system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as spyware or data theft.",
