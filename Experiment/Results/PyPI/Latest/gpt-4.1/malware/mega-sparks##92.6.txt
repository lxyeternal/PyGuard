      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that the package is designed to run arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic used by malicious packages to execute malicious payloads without user awareness. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions directly within the provided snippet, but the invocation of external code ('main') during installation indicates potential malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other harmful components. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its capability to execute arbitrary code during setup.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
