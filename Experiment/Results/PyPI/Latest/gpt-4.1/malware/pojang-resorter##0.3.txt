      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute automatically upon installation of the package, taking a screenshot of the user's screen and sending it to a specified Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes malicious activity because it captures potentially sensitive visual information without user consent and transmits it to an external server. Additionally, the code installs required packages silently, which could be used to facilitate further malicious actions. Overall, the code's intent to secretly collect and exfiltrate user data classifies it as malicious.",
