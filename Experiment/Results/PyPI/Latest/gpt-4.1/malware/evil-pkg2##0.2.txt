Additionally, it sets up a package named 'evil-pkg2' with a package directory 'evil_pkg2', which could be used to distribute malicious code or backdoors. The combination of making an external request to a suspicious endpoint and setting up a package with a name implying malicious intent indicates malicious behavior, possibly for command and control, data exfiltration, or malicious package distribution.",
