      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code fetched from an external source via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to run malicious payloads silently during package installation, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to conceal harmful activities and target specific operating systems.",
