This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control capabilities, which are typical malicious behaviors. The request is made without user consent or awareness, indicating an attempt to communicate with a potentially malicious server, possibly to send system information, receive commands, or perform other harmful actions. The code's primary purpose appears to be to embed this malicious network activity into a package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malicious package distribution.",
