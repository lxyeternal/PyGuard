Decoding this string reveals a URL (`https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z`) which likely points to an external resource. Such behavior suggests the code is designed to fetch or reference external content, potentially for malicious purposes such as retrieving malicious payloads, exfiltrating data, or executing remote code. The presence of an obfuscated URL indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent, which is characteristic of malicious scripts.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and starts a new thread that executes the result of the function 't' called with '__safety_token__' as an argument. Since 't' and '__safety_token__' are imported from a local module, their contents are unknown, but the pattern suggests that 't(__safety_token__)' likely returns malicious code or a payload that is executed immediately in a separate thread. This behavior is characteristic of obfuscated or malicious scripts aiming to run hidden or unauthorized code without detection, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful activities.",
