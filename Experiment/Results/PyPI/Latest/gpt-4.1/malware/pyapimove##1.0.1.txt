      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly search for a specific folder named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, locate the 'Telegram.exe' executable within that folder, and then collect and compress files from that folder while excluding certain files and directories. It then uploads the resulting archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, potentially stealing sensitive user data associated with Telegram, and transmitting it to an attacker-controlled server. The code operates stealthily, avoiding certain directories and files, and dynamically determines the upload URL segment, which are common tactics in malicious data theft tools.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly search for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, locate the 'Telegram.exe' executable within those folders, and then create a compressed archive of the folder contents excluding certain files and directories. It then uploads this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The process includes dynamically determining a directory number by querying the server, which suggests an attempt to avoid overwriting previous uploads. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, potentially capturing user data or sensitive information from targeted directories without user consent. The use of obfuscation, selective file exclusion, and remote data transfer strongly suggest malicious intent, such as spying, data theft, or malware distribution.",
