      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly collects sensitive system information such as the user ID and hostname and sends it to an external server without user consent. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity used to gather information about the infected system for malicious purposes. The code also suppresses warnings and ignores request exceptions, which can help it operate covertly and avoid detection or debugging efforts. Overall, these actions are characteristic of malicious code designed to spy on the user and transmit data to an attacker-controlled server.",
