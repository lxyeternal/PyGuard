      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to detect the presence of the 'torchvision' library, and if found, it executes a shell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote server at 'http://192.3.209.43:8080/favicon.txt'. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, as it involves remote code execution, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The use of 'curl' piped directly into 'sh' indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code fetched from an external source without any validation, representing a clear security threat.",
