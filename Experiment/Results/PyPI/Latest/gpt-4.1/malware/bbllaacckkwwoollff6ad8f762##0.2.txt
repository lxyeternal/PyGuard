      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains behavior indicative of malicious intent. Specifically, during installation, it executes code fetched from a remote server ('http://blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/rw/b') via an HTTP GET request, and then executes the retrieved code using the `exec()` function. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, the code attempts to send data to a remote server via an HTTP PUT request, potentially exfiltrating information. The use of obfuscated or suspicious URLs and the execution of remote code during installation are classic indicators of malicious activity.",
