      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module 'main'. This behavior suggests that during package installation, it triggers arbitrary code execution from an external source, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to run malicious payloads or establish unauthorized access, making this code potentially harmful.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the /realtime_p/pypi/ endpoint with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, fingerprinting, or further exploitation.",
