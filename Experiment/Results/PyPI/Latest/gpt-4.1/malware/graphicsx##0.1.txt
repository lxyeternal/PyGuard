      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed string, which likely contains malicious code. The use of such obfuscation techniques—reversing the string, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression—aims to hide malicious intent and evade detection. When executed, it can run arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful actions. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts intended to conceal and execute malicious payloads.",
