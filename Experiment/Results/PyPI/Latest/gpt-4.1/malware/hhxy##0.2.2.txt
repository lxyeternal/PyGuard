This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware. The script's content and purpose are unknown, and executing such scripts from untrusted sources poses significant security risks. Therefore, this code is malicious as it facilitates remote code execution and potential malicious activities.",
