      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a curl command to send an HTTP request to a specific URL, which appears to be a webhook endpoint. This behavior suggests that the script is exfiltrating data or notifying an external server, potentially as part of a malicious operation such as data theft, command and control communication, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of subprocess to invoke curl indicates an attempt to perform network activity outside the normal program flow, which is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to communicate with external servers without user awareness.",
