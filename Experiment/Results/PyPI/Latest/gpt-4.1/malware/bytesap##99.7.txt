      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code on the target system. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or modifying system files, making this code potentially harmful.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, potentially for tracking, profiling, or further malicious activities. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting system information, which is characteristic of malicious payloads designed to spy on or compromise the host system.",
