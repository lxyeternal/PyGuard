It extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, system information, and potentially Minecraft account details, then sends this information to multiple external URLs via webhook POST requests. The obfuscated URLs, combined with the data harvesting activities, strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at spying, credential theft, and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
