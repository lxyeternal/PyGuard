      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it will run arbitrary code from an external module, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads or establish unauthorized access on the target system. The code does not perform any obvious benign actions beyond package setup, indicating that its primary purpose is likely to execute malicious code during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming the malicious intent.",
