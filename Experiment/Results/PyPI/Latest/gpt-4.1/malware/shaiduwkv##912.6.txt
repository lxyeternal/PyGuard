      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon package installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, payloads, or malware without user consent, making the package potentially harmful. The code's obfuscation of the malicious activity within the install process indicates malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a random number as a parameter, likely to evade detection and track individual infections. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity, such as spyware or backdoor communication.",
