      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden functionality designed to exfiltrate user data by creating a ZIP archive of the Telegram Desktop data directory (located in the user's AppData folder) and uploading it to a remote Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API. This behavior is concealed within functions that appear to handle color formatting and console output, which are legitimate features. The backup process is triggered automatically when certain functions are called, and it runs in a background thread, making it less obvious. The code also attempts to clean up the ZIP file after uploading. Such activity indicates malicious intent to secretly collect and transmit sensitive user data without user consent, classifying it as malicious behavior.",
