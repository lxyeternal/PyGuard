It writes a script that continuously fetches commands from a remote server and executes them locally, effectively allowing an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine. The script is designed to run silently in the background, hide itself (on Windows), and set itself to execute on system startup, enabling persistent access. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious remote access trojans (RATs) and are intended for unauthorized control, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
