      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from an external ZIP archive ('my.zip') during the installation process, which can be used to execute arbitrary malicious code. This behavior bypasses standard package installation mechanisms and can be exploited to run malicious payloads without user awareness. The use of zipimport to load code from an external archive and executing a function ('hello') from it indicates an attempt to hide malicious activities within the package setup process, making it potentially harmful.",
