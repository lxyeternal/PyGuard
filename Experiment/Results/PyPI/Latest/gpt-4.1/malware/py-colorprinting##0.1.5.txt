      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from an external URL ('https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip'), extracts its contents, and executes a specific executable ('ore-miner.exe') from the extracted files. This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run potentially malicious payloads from an external server, which can be used for remote code execution, malware installation, or other malicious activities. The use of threading to perform this operation asynchronously further suggests an intent to conceal or delay detection. Overall, these actions are characteristic of malicious code designed to compromise the host system.",
