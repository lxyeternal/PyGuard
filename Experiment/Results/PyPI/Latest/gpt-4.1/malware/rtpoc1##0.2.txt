      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a check on the hostname's SHA-1 hash and, if it does not match a specific value, it attempts to silently send an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior suggests the code is designed to 'phone home' or communicate with a remote server, potentially for tracking, exfiltration, or command-and-control purposes. The use of a hostname hash check indicates an attempt to evade detection or restrict execution to certain environments. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious activity, especially given the silent network request and obfuscated hostname verification.",
