      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to perform automated transactions on multiple blockchain networks (Ethereum, BSC, and Solana) by sending maximum possible funds from a specified private key to designated validation contract addresses. This behavior suggests it is designed to drain or deplete the sender's account balances by repeatedly transferring funds to these addresses, which could be malicious if used without user consent. The code does not include any user prompts, safeguards, or explanations, indicating it may be intended for malicious purposes such as draining funds or executing unauthorized transactions. Therefore, it is classified as malicious behavior.",
