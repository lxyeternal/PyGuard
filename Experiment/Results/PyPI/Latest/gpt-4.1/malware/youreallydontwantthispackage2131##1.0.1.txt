      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external server (`https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip`). This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates sensitive credentials (Google Cloud access tokens) to an attacker-controlled server, potentially enabling unauthorized access or further malicious activities. The code is integrated into the package installation process, ensuring the malicious payload executes whenever the package is installed or developed, making it a form of supply chain attack or backdoor.",
