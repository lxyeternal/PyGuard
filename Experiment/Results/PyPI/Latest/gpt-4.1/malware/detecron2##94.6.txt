      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main.py', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing unwanted operations. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity within the installation process, making it potentially malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming malicious intent.",
