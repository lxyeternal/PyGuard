      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'pt()' that downloads an executable file ('sm.exe') from a remote URL ('https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe') and executes it on the host machine. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves retrieving and running potentially harmful software without user consent. Additionally, the code's obfuscation through a custom token encryption/decryption method suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose, which is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to encrypt Python source code and generate a separate script ('mainscript.pyw') that decrypts and executes the encrypted code at runtime. This obfuscation technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, making analysis and detection more difficult. The use of 'exec' to run decrypted code dynamically, combined with the encryption/decryption process, suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities, such as executing hidden malicious scripts or payloads without easy detection. Additionally, the code's structure and behavior resemble typical obfuscation tactics employed in malicious scripts to evade static analysis and facilitate stealthy execution.",
