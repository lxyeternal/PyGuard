      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-installation hook that executes during package installation, which sends an HTTP request to an external webhook URL containing the system's hostname, OS name, and public IP address. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it attempts to exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent. The use of a webhook URL and the collection of system details suggest the code is designed for tracking or potentially malicious surveillance purposes, rather than legitimate package installation.",
