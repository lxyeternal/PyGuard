      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to clandestinely collect sensitive user data, including system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account details, and then exfiltrate this data to remote servers via multiple webhooks. It employs techniques typical of malware, such as accessing local storage, decrypting or reading encrypted passwords, harvesting tokens, and sending the data without user consent. The use of base64-encoded URLs for command-and-control servers, combined with the collection of potentially private information, indicates malicious intent aimed at data theft and unauthorized surveillance.",
