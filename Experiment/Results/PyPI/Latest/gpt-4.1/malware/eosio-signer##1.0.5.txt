It then uploads this file to an external IP address via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is malicious as it attempts to secretly transmit potentially sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. The use of environment variables for private keys and the silent collection of system details further suggest malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'EOSIOKey' that, upon instantiation, executes system commands to retrieve hostname, user, and network configuration, then immediately uploads the contents of '/tmp/r' to an external server at 'http://61.28.229.27'. It also writes hostname, user, and network info into '/tmp/r'. This behavior indicates data exfiltration and system reconnaissance, which are typical malicious activities. Additionally, the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling and signing functions, but the embedded system commands and external data transfer strongly suggest malicious intent, such as stealing system information or private keys.",
