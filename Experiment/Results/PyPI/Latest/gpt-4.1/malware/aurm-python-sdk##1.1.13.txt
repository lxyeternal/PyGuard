It then attempts to execute this script by appending a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently execute arbitrary code or malicious payloads on the victim's machine, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the package itself, suggesting that its primary purpose is malicious.",
