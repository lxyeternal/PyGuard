It then sends these seed phrases in plain text to a Telegram chat via a bot API. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive user information, such as seed phrases, to an external attacker-controlled channel. Such activity is characteristic of malicious code designed to steal private keys or recovery phrases, potentially leading to theft of funds or identity compromise.",
