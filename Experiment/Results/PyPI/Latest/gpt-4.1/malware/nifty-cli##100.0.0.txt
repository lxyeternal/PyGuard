This behavior can be used for malicious purposes such as tracking, data exfiltration, or triggering malicious payloads without user consent. The use of obfuscation (Caesar cipher decoding) and the integration into the setup script indicates an intent to conceal malicious activity, classifying this as malicious code.",
