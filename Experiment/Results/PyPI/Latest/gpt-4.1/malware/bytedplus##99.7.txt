      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, imports and executes a function `main()` from a module named `main`. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the `main()` function, which is executed automatically upon installation. Such behavior is often used to run malicious payloads without user consent, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as installing backdoors, malware, or executing harmful scripts on the target system. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity within the installation process, making it suspicious and potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
