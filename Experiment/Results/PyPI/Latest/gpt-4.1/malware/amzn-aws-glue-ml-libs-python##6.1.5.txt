This behavior can be used to exfiltrate data, verify the presence of the malware, or trigger malicious actions on the attacker's server. Embedding such network activity within a package's installation routine is a common tactic for malicious code, especially if the request is hidden or not clearly documented. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior intended to communicate with an external server without user consent.",

This behavior suggests that the script is attempting to contact a remote server, potentially to download malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or execute commands. The URL and port are suspicious and do not correspond to legitimate services, indicating malicious intent such as command and control communication or data exfiltration.",
