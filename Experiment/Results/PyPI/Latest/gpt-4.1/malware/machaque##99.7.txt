      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized network connections, or modifying system files. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute code outside the normal setup process, raising suspicion of malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate function and appears designed to gather and transmit potentially private information covertly, making it malicious.",
