      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it will run arbitrary code from an external module, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the target system. The code does not specify what 'main' does, but the pattern of executing code during installation is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate function and appears designed to gather and transmit potentially private information covertly, making it malicious.",
