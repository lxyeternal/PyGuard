      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated through multiple layers of decoding and decompression, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. It decodes and executes several payloads, including base64-encoded, marshaled, zlib-compressed, and hex-encoded code snippets. These layers likely conceal malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or installation of backdoors. The repeated decoding and execution of embedded code strongly suggest an intent to run hidden, potentially harmful operations on the host system, making this code malicious.",
