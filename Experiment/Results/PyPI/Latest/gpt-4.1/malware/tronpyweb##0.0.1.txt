      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes. It collects a private key (likely sensitive information) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron'), which could be used to exfiltrate private data such as cryptographic keys or credentials. Additionally, it performs a GET request to check a 'switcher' endpoint, potentially to determine whether to execute further malicious actions or to control its behavior remotely. The overall pattern suggests data theft and remote control capabilities, characteristic of malicious or spyware code.",
