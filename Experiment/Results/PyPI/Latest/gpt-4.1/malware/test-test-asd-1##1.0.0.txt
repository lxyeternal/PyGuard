      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, retrieves the current system's hostname and username, encodes this information in base64, and then constructs a domain name with this encoded data. It then performs a DNS lookup (`nslookup`) on this domain, which points to a suspicious and likely malicious domain (`tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun`). This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate system information covertly via DNS queries, a common technique used by malware or malicious actors to gather environment details or establish command-and-control communication channels without raising suspicion. The use of obfuscated data and DNS-based exfiltration indicates malicious intent.",
