      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or compromising the system. This pattern is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads during installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
