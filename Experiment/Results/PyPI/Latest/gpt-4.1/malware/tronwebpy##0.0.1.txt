      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate a private key by sending it to an external server ('https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron') via an HTTP POST request. The private key is included in a data structure that is likely intended to be sent as JSON, although the syntax used ('{'ptivat_key', private_key}') is invalid and would cause an error. If corrected, this behavior indicates an attempt to steal sensitive information (private keys), which is malicious. Additionally, the code fetches a 'switcher' value from another external server, possibly to determine whether to execute further malicious actions, which is characteristic of malicious or maliciously controlled scripts. Overall, the intent to exfiltrate private keys and the use of external command-and-control servers strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
