This behavior suggests that during the package installation process, arbitrary code from an external module ('main') is executed without any validation or user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it can run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system during installation. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks that justify executing external code, indicating malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming malicious intent.",
