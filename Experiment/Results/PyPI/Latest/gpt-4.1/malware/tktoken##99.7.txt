      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon package installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, potentially compromising the system or executing unwanted actions without user consent. The code's structure and the automatic invocation of external code during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection points, suggesting the script is designed to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information for malicious purposes.",
