      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be an obfuscated or encrypted payload that loads a runtime component (__pyarmor__) and executes it with a large, seemingly random byte string. This pattern is characteristic of code that is designed to conceal malicious intent, such as hiding malicious payloads, malware, or unauthorized code execution. The presence of a runtime loader combined with a large, opaque data blob suggests that the script is intended to run hidden or protected code, which could perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or executing malicious payloads without detection. Without deobfuscation or further context, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
