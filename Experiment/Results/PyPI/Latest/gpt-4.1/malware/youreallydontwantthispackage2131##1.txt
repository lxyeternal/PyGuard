This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials (Google Cloud service account token) to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is malicious. The code is designed to run during installation, development, or egg info commands, making it likely to be used as a backdoor or credential theft mechanism.",
