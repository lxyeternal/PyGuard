      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly collects system information such as user ID, hostname, and environment variables, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration, which is commonly associated with malicious activities like spying, unauthorized surveillance, or preparing for further exploitation. The code also suppresses warnings and ignores request exceptions, which can hinder detection and troubleshooting, further indicating malicious intent.",
