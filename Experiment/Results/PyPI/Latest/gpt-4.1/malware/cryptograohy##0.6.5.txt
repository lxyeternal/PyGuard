      "malicious_behavior": "The code installs a package named 'pyprettifier' during the post-installation process, which may be used to modify or obfuscate text or code. While 'pyprettifier' itself is not inherently malicious, the behavior of automatically installing and importing additional packages during setup can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as installing malware, backdoors, or spyware without user consent. Additionally, the code writes exception messages to a temporary file '/tmp/a', which could be used to exfiltrate information or hide malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious or potentially unwanted software.",
