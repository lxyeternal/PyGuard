      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string which, when decoded, executes the command 'test'. While the command itself ('test') appears benign, the use of base64 decoding combined with exec() is a common obfuscation technique used to hide malicious payloads. This pattern suggests that the code is designed to conceal potentially harmful commands or scripts that could be malicious. Without further context or additional payloads, it is prudent to classify this as malicious behavior due to its obfuscation and execution of dynamically decoded code.",
