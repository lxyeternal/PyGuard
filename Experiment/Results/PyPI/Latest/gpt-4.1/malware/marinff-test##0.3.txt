      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP address and port. It encodes this command in base64, then decodes and executes it via a shell command. The reverse shell, when run, connects back to the attacker's machine, providing remote access with shell privileges. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it facilitates unauthorized remote control of the compromised system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious actions.",
