      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, download malware, or perform other harmful actions without user consent. The code's structure and the automatic invocation of external code during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, suggesting the script is designed to spy on the user or system and transmit potentially sensitive information to malicious actors.",
