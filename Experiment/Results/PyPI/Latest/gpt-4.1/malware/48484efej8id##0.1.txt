      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setup script that includes a post-installation function 'run_after_install', which executes a base64-encoded payload. When the package is installed, this function runs automatically, decoding and executing the embedded code. The decoded content is a simple print statement ('test'), but the use of base64 encoding and execution of dynamically decoded code is a common technique to hide malicious activities such as downloading, installing, or executing harmful payloads without immediate detection. This behavior indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent, making the code potentially malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string which, when decoded, executes the command 'test'. While the command itself ('test') appears benign, the use of base64 decoding combined with exec() is a common obfuscation technique used to hide malicious payloads. This pattern suggests that the code is designed to conceal potentially harmful commands or scripts, making it suspicious. Without further context or additional payloads, it is difficult to determine the exact malicious intent, but the obfuscation itself is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
