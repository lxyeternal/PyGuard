This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at reconnaissance and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of a private IP address for the server further suggests an attacker-controlled infrastructure. Although the code appears to be packaged as a legitimate Python package, the embedded data collection and exfiltration functionality indicate malicious intent.",
