      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically loads and executes external code by reading multiple files ('test_address_list3.py' and 'test_address_list2.py'), processing their contents, decoding them from base64, and then executing the combined payload via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that attempt to obfuscate their true intent, often to evade detection. The use of file reading, base64 decoding, and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads, which could include malware, backdoors, or other harmful activities. Without inspecting the contents of the external files, the code's behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, as it facilitates the execution of potentially harmful code obtained from external sources.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be obfuscated, with base64-encoded strings and hexadecimal representations that decode to Python code. Analyzing the decoded content reveals that it constructs and executes Python code dynamically, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Specifically, the code appears to generate and run a Python script that may attempt to execute system commands or perform actions without explicit user consent. The use of dynamic code generation, obfuscation, and potential execution of system commands indicates malicious intent, such as executing arbitrary code, potentially downloading or running malicious payloads, or compromising system security.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions related to generating Bitcoin addresses, private keys, and cryptographic operations, which are often used in cryptocurrency wallet applications. However, several functions such as 'get_virtual_address', 'detect_address', and 'init_set' dynamically execute code loaded from external or encoded sources, which can be exploited to run arbitrary malicious code. Additionally, the presence of base64-encoded URLs and file operations that write to potentially sensitive locations suggest an attempt to download or execute remote payloads. The code's structure and obfuscated parts indicate an intent to hide malicious activities, such as stealing private keys, installing malware, or establishing remote control. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the code's obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and cryptographic functions that could be used for malicious purposes.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be obfuscated and encodes a payload that, when decoded, performs network communication with a remote server, potentially exfiltrating data or executing arbitrary commands. It constructs and sends HTTP POST requests with encoded data, likely to a command-and-control server, indicating malicious intent such as data theft, remote code execution, or command control. The use of base64 encoding, dynamic request construction, and obfuscation techniques strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at covertly communicating with an attacker-controlled server.",
