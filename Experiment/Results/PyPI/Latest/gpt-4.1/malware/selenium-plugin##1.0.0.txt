      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a post-install hook that executes a command to run a function (`run_autostart_setup`) from the module `selenium-plugin.autostart` using `pythonw`. This behavior suggests that upon installation, the package attempts to execute code that could potentially set up persistent or background processes without explicit user consent. The use of `pythonw` (which runs Python scripts without a console window) indicates an intent to run silently, which is often associated with malicious or unwanted activity such as establishing persistence, auto-start mechanisms, or executing malicious payloads. The code does not provide any safeguards or user prompts, and the function `run_autostart_setup` is not defined within the provided snippet, raising suspicion that it may perform malicious actions like establishing backdoors, spying, or other harmful behaviors.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from an external URL, extracts its contents, searches for an executable file within the extracted files, and then adds that executable to the current user's startup registry key. This behavior is characteristic of malware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as it automatically executes malicious or unwanted code upon user login without user consent. The use of a hardcoded URL, automated download, extraction, and persistence setup strongly suggests malicious intent, such as establishing persistence for malware or remote control.",
