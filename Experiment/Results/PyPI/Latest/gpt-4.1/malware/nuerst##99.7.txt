      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or executing unwanted commands. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior within the installation process, making it potentially malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and is designed to secretly transmit system data to external servers, making it malicious.",
