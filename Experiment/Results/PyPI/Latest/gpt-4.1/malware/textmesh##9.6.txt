      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module 'main'. This behavior suggests that during package installation, arbitrary code from 'main' is run, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads or establish unauthorized access, making this code potentially harmful.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming its malicious intent.",
