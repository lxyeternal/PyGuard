      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon installation. Such behavior is often used to run malicious payloads without user consent or awareness, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, malware installation, or system compromise. The code itself does not perform any obvious malicious actions directly but relies on executing external code ('main') during setup, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further confirming malicious intent.",
