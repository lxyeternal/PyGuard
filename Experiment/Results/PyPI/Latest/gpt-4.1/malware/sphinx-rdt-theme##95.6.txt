      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during the package installation process, arbitrary code from an external module ('main') is executed without any validation or user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it can be used to run malicious scripts, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the user's system during installation. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical, but the execution of external code during installation is a significant red flag indicating malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostnames, usernames, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the external URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, further confirming malicious intent.",
