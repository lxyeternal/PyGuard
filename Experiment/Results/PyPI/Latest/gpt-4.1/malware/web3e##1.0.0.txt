      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install class that executes an encrypted payload during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts and executes code using the Fernet symmetric encryption module, which is a common technique to obfuscate malicious scripts. The payload is only triggered on Windows (nt) systems, and the use of encrypted data suggests an attempt to evade detection. This behavior indicates the code is designed to silently run malicious code during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
