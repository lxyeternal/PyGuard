      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom installation class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted payload using the Fernet encryption scheme. This payload is likely malicious, potentially executing arbitrary code, malware, or backdoors without user consent. The obfuscation, use of encryption, and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at compromising the target system.",
