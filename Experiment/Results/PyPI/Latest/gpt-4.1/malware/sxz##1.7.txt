      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded ZIP archive, writes it to a file named '.Devil', and then executes it as a Python script with command-line arguments. After execution, it deletes the file. This behavior indicates the script is designed to download, extract, and run potentially malicious code dynamically, which is a common tactic for malware delivery, obfuscation, or remote code execution. The use of base64 encoding, temporary file creation, and cleanup further suggests malicious intent to conceal the payload and avoid detection.",
