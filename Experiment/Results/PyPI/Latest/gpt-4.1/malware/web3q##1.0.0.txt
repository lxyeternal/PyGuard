      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it uses the 'cryptography' (Fernet) module to decrypt an embedded payload and executes it via 'exec', which can run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise during the package installation process. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are common tactics in malicious Python packages to evade detection.",
