      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from a module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it will run arbitrary code from an external module, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to execute malicious payloads or establish unauthorized access when the package is installed, making it potentially harmful.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
