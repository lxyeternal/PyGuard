      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. This pattern is often used in malicious Python packages to execute harmful code during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, which are common in malicious scripts aiming to gather information about the infected system without user consent. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond this data collection and transmission, indicating malicious intent.",
