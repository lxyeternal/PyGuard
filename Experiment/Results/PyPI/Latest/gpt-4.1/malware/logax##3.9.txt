      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated behavior designed to download and execute a remote payload. It decodes base64-encoded URLs and filenames, retrieves a file from a remote server, saves it locally, and then executes it via os.system. This pattern is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware download, or backdoor installation. Additionally, the code writes a specific marker ('#[//]') into an '__init__.py' file to possibly mark or control subsequent behavior. Overall, these actions suggest the script is intended to perform malicious operations, including downloading and executing potentially harmful code.",
