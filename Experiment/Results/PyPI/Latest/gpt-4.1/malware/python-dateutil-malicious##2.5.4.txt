It then sends this data to an external server controlled by an attacker via an HTTP POST request. This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive data without user consent, indicating malicious intent such as reconnaissance or data theft. Additionally, the package is named to suggest it is a legitimate dependency ('python-dateutil-malicious') and is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks, further indicating malicious intent.",
