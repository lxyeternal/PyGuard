      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, gathers sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://burpcollaborator.net). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves covertly exfiltrating potentially sensitive user and system data without user consent or awareness. The use of a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net) further suggests malicious intent, as it is commonly associated with security testing and reconnaissance activities. Overall, the code is designed to surreptitiously collect and transmit user environment details, which is a typical tactic in malicious or spyware-like operations.",
