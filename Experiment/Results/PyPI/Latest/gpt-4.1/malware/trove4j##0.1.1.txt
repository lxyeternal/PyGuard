      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, which appears to be an obfuscated way to hide the destination address. It then makes an HTTP request to this URL, appending the current hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is attempting to contact an external server without user knowledge, potentially to exfiltrate information (such as the hostname) or to receive commands. The obfuscation and external communication are common indicators of malicious activity, such as command-and-control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or tracking. Therefore, this code is likely malicious.",
