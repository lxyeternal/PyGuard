      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated and encrypted payload, likely part of a protected or packed malicious script. The presence of a runtime decryption or unpacking mechanism (e.g., the call to `__pyarmor__`) suggests that the code is designed to conceal its true intent. Such obfuscation is commonly used to hide malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code, establishing backdoors, or performing unauthorized actions on the host system. The code's structure and the use of a runtime decryption function indicate an intent to evade detection and analysis, which is characteristic of malicious software.",
