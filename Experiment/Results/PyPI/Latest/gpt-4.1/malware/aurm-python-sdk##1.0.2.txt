It then attempts to execute this script by appending a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently execute arbitrary code or data fetched from an external source, which could be malicious. Such actions can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise, especially since the external URL is not controlled or verified by the user. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by downloading and executing remote content without user consent or validation.",
