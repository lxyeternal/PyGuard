      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main.py', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing unwanted operations. The code's structure indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code automatically upon package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with malicious or suspicious activity (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This behavior suggests the script is designed to exfiltrate system information to remote servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance, tracking, or further exploitation. The use of random URL paths and the obfuscated nature of the request pattern further indicate malicious intent.",
