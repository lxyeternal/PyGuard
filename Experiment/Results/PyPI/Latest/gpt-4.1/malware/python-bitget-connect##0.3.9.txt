      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains two separate payloads designed to execute potentially harmful actions. On Windows systems, it decodes a base64-encoded PowerShell script that writes a PowerShell script to the user's appdata directory, executes it, and then deletes it. The embedded PowerShell script appears to be obfuscated and likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. On POSIX systems, it downloads a binary file from a remote URL, sets its permissions to be executable, and runs it in the background, which could be a malicious payload. Both behaviors are typical of malware attempting to establish persistence, download additional malicious components, or compromise the system.",
