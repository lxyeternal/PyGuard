This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive information without user consent or awareness. The use of an external URL (which appears to be a temporary ngrok tunnel) further indicates an attempt to hide or obfuscate the malicious activity. Such behavior can be used for espionage, credential theft, or other malicious purposes.",
