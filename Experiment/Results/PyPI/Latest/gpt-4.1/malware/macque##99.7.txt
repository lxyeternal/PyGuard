This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing unwanted commands. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute potentially malicious payloads during the package installation process, making it malicious.",

This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond gathering and transmitting potentially private information, suggesting it is designed for malicious purposes such as spying, tracking, or unauthorized data collection.",
