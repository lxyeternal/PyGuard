It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker (the URL appears to be a malicious or suspicious domain). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at fingerprinting or exfiltrating user environment details without user consent, which can be used for further exploitation or targeted attacks.",
