This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary code embedded within the ZIP file, which is a common tactic for delivering malicious payloads. The use of importlib and zipimport to load and run code from an external archive during setup indicates an intent to execute potentially harmful code without explicit disclosure, making this behavior malicious.",
