      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. The code's structure indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code automatically during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information to malicious servers.",
