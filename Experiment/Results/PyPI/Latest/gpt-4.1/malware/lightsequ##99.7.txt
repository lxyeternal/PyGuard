      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during installation. Such behavior is often used to run malicious payloads without user consent or awareness, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, malware installation, or system compromise. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with the imported 'main' function, indicating that its primary purpose is likely malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with malicious or malicious-like activity (e.g., oast domains used for security testing or command-and-control). This behavior suggests the code is designed for data exfiltration or reconnaissance, potentially as part of a malware or spyware operation. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function and is likely intended to secretly gather and transmit user environment data to malicious servers.",
