      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly search for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, locate the 'Telegram.exe' executable within those folders, and then create a compressed archive of the folder contents excluding certain files and directories. It then uploads this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, as it collects potentially sensitive files from user directories and transmits them to an attacker-controlled server without user consent. The use of obfuscation techniques such as dynamic directory numbering and exclusion lists further suggests malicious intent aimed at stealth and persistence.",
