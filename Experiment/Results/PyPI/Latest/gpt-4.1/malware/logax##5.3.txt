      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL, saves it to the local system, and then executes it without any user consent or validation. This behavior is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks, as it can be used to deliver malicious payloads, compromise the host system, and perform unauthorized actions. The use of base64 encoding for URLs and filenames, dynamic file download, and silent execution further suggest an intent to obfuscate malicious activity.",
