      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `confirm_transaction` that constructs a message with sensitive information, including the wallet's secret key (converted to hex), and sends it via a Telegram bot API. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate private key data, which is malicious. The code appears to be designed to secretly transmit sensitive wallet information to an external attacker-controlled Telegram chat, potentially enabling theft or unauthorized access to the user's funds. The rest of the code consists of placeholder functions with no operational logic, but the presence of the secret key exfiltration makes the overall code malicious.",
