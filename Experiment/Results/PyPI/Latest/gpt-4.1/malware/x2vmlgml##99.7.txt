      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized network connections, or modifying system files. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute additional code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to compromise systems upon installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a unique random number in the request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at gathering information about the infected system without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function beyond data collection and transmission, confirming its malicious intent.",
