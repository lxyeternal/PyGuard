      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted logic that, upon execution, decrypts and runs potentially malicious payloads. It performs environment checks (such as detecting debuggers, virtual machines, or analysis tools) and then executes encrypted code that is decrypted at runtime. This decrypted code likely performs malicious activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or persistence mechanisms. The use of heavy obfuscation, environment detection, and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at evading detection and analysis.",
