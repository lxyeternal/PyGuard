This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is typical of malicious scripts aiming to gather sensitive information without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to its package name and instead focuses on covertly harvesting system data and transmitting it to an external server, indicating malicious intent.",
