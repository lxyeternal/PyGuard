      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes. It collects a 'private_key' parameter, which is likely sensitive information such as a private cryptographic key, and then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron'). This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially confidential information. Additionally, the code fetches a 'switcher' value from another external URL, which could be used to control or trigger malicious actions remotely. Overall, the code is intended to steal private keys and communicate with an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
