This behavior constitutes malicious activity because it involves unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, the code is integrated into a package setup script with an entry point that executes during installation, enabling automatic execution of the data collection and exfiltration process whenever the package is installed. This covert data harvesting and transmission pose significant privacy and security risks, classifying the code as malicious.",
