      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string that, when executed, prints a message indicating 'hello monkey boys'. This message is likely a decoy or a distraction, but the use of 'exec' on decoded data is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. The code's structure suggests it is designed to conceal its true intent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Without additional context or further payloads, it is difficult to determine the exact malicious actions, but the obfuscation and use of 'exec' strongly indicate malicious intent.",
