This hook sends an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook URL, including the system's hostname, OS name, and public IP address as query parameters. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is malicious. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or configuration tasks that justify such network activity, and it appears designed to secretly collect and transmit system information to an external server.",
