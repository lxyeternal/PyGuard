This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials (access tokens) from a compromised or malicious environment to an external server, which is a common tactic in malicious activities such as data theft or unauthorized access. The code is embedded within custom setup commands, which could be used to covertly run malicious actions during package installation or development setup, further indicating malicious intent.",
