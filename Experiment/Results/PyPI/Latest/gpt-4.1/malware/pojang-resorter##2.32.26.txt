      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern is typical of malware attempting to hide its true intent by hiding the payload through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation. The payload likely performs harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or remote command execution. The use of dynamic code execution and layered decoding strongly indicates malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory without any user interaction or validation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that execute potentially harmful binaries, which could be used to deploy malware, perform unauthorized actions, or compromise the system. The code also suppresses output from the executable, making detection and analysis more difficult, further indicating malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses base64 decoding, string reversal, and zlib decompression to hide its true intent. The payload, once decoded and decompressed, is executed via `exec()`, which is a common technique for executing malicious code. This pattern suggests the code is intended to run hidden or harmful operations, such as installing malware, stealing data, or establishing unauthorized access. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that execute external scripts and modules with potentially malicious intent. Notably, the 'nukeserver' command imports and calls a 'nukeserver' function from an external module, which strongly suggests destructive behavior such as deleting or damaging server data or infrastructure. Additionally, the 'assign_operator' command imports and executes a function from 'forceop', which could be used to escalate privileges or take control of systems. The presence of commands like 'nukeserver' and 'forceop' indicates malicious intent, potentially aimed at compromising, damaging, or gaining unauthorized control over systems. The code's structure facilitates remote command execution, which is a common trait of malware or backdoors.",
