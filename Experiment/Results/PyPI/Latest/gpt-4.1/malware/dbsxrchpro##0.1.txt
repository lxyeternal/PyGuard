      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code via exec(). This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious activities such as downloading and executing malware, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful operations. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to evade detection and analysis.",
