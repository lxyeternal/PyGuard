      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using exec. The decoded payload imports modules related to file handling, system operations, and HTTP requests, and then performs network requests to a specific URL ('http://127.0.0.1:8000/inject/DaTDCxiSvq9OA6r'). It also appears to process some data and potentially execute further code. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts that download, execute, or communicate with remote servers, possibly to exfiltrate data, install malware, or perform other harmful actions. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
