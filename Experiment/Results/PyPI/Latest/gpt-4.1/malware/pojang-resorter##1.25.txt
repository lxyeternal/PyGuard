      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon package installation, attempts to execute an external executable file ('your_executable.exe') located within the installed package directory. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code without user consent or awareness. Running external executables during installation can lead to malware execution, system compromise, or other malicious activities, especially if the executable is malicious or tampered with. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an external program during the installation process, which is a common tactic used in malware distribution.",
