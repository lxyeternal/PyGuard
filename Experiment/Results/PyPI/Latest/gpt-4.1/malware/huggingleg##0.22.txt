      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute a file from an external IP address ('1.13.187.150') using 'wget', then sets execute permissions and runs it in the background. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it could be used to download and run malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads without user consent. The check for an environment variable 'X' suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution conditions. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious activity aimed at remote code execution and persistence.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote server (122.51.221.63/pytorch), makes it executable, and runs it in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading and executing malware, remote command execution, or establishing a backdoor. The use of 'nohup' and background execution further suggests an attempt to persist or operate covertly, indicating malicious intent.",
