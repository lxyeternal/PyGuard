      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The 'main' function could perform any malicious activity, such as downloading malware, establishing unauthorized network connections, or executing harmful commands. This pattern is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a unique random number in the request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying on the user or system. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function beyond data collection and transmission, confirming its malicious intent.",
