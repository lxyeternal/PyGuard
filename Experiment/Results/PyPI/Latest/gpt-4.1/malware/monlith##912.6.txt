This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code at install time, which could be used to run malicious payloads, modify system state, or perform unauthorized actions without user consent. The code does not provide any legitimate reason for executing 'main' during installation, indicating it is likely intended for malicious purposes such as backdooring or executing malicious scripts upon package installation.",

This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously, making it malicious.",
