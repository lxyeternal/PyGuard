      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables from the host system by sending them to an external Google Chat webhook. This behavior can be used maliciously to gather sensitive information such as environment configurations, credentials, or other secrets stored in environment variables. Additionally, the code does not include any user prompts or safeguards, indicating it operates covertly. The use of external communication channels to transmit potentially sensitive data without user consent is a hallmark of malicious activity.",
