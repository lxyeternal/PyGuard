      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and writes its contents to a local file ('~/.fleetwood.py'). It then appends a command ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') if not already present. This behavior effectively executes remote code on the user's machine without explicit consent, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The purpose appears to be to establish persistence and execute arbitrary code, potentially allowing remote control or data exfiltration. Such actions are highly suspicious and characteristic of malware or backdoor behavior.",
