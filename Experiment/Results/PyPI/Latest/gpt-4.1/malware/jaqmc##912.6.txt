This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically upon package installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, malware, or unauthorized actions without user consent, making the package potentially harmful.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. The URLs are obfuscated with seemingly random subdomains and include a random number as a parameter, likely to evade detection or caching. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying or gathering information for malicious purposes.",
