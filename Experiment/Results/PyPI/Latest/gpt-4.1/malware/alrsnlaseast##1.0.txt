      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a shell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote URL via curl piped directly into bash. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, as it can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code only proceeds with this action if the 'torchvision' module is importable, which may be used as a trigger or check for specific environments. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious payloads designed to compromise systems by executing remote code.",
