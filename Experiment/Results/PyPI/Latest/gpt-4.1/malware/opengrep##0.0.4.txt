      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://40393dc29bdc15fd0245e3ac19611ae3.m.pipedream.net) with the hostname of the URL as a parameter. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking of the environment where the code runs, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code also suppresses all warnings and silently ignores request exceptions, making detection and debugging difficult. Overall, this pattern indicates an attempt to covertly communicate with an external server, likely for malicious purposes such as data theft, command and control, or reconnaissance.",
