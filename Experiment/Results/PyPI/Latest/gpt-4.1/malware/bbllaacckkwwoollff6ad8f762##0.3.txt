      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a command (`ls -alh /run/secrets/`) on a specific system user ('modelarts') and then encode the output in base64 (with padding characters '=' removed). It then sends this encoded data via an HTTP PUT request to a remote server controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, where sensitive or system information is being secretly collected and transmitted without user consent. The code is embedded within a setup script, which can execute during package installation, making it potentially stealthy and difficult for users to detect. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by surreptitiously gathering system information and transmitting it to an external server, constituting a clear security threat.",
