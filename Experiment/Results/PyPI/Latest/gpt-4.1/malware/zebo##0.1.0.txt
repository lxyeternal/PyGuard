      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a potentially malicious script during installation by running an inline Python command that imports and calls the function `i_am_cute` from the module `zebo.scripts.runner`. This behavior suggests an attempt to run arbitrary or hidden code post-installation, which could be used to perform malicious actions such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing unwanted commands. The presence of a function named `i_am_cute` is suspiciously informal and may be a placeholder or a decoy, but the core concern is the execution of code during setup without explicit user consent or awareness. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to operate as a remote surveillance and keylogging malware. It performs multiple malicious activities, including capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, and exfiltrating sensitive data to a remote server. It also ensures persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder, enabling it to run automatically on system boot. The code communicates with a remote server to receive commands such as taking additional screenshots, uploading logs, and executing other actions, which indicates remote control capabilities. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious spyware or remote access trojans (RATs), aimed at covertly monitoring and stealing user data without consent.",
