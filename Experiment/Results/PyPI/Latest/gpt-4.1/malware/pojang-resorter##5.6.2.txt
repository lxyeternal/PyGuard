      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded, reversed byte string, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern is typical of malware attempting to hide its true intent by hiding the payload through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation. The payload likely performs harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or remote command execution, although the exact malicious activity cannot be determined without executing or fully decoding the payload. Overall, this code is malicious due to its obfuscation and dynamic execution of hidden code.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subdirectory, which is suspicious behavior. The executable's name suggests it may be a Windows-specific binary, and its execution could be used to run malicious payloads or malware. Additionally, the code logs the process and includes random status messages, which may be designed to obfuscate or mask malicious activity. Overall, executing an external binary without validation or user consent is a common indicator of malicious intent, especially if the binary's purpose is unknown or untrusted.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to automatically add a specific executable ('pojangsetup.exe') to the Windows startup folder and then executes it. This behavior suggests persistence mechanisms commonly used by malware to ensure the malicious executable runs on system startup without user consent. The use of 'win32com.client' to create a shortcut and 'subprocess.Popen' to run the executable indicates an intent to maintain persistent, possibly hidden, execution. Such actions are characteristic of malicious software aiming to establish persistence and potentially perform malicious activities in the background.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that execute external scripts and modules with potentially malicious intent. Notably, the 'nukeserver' command imports and calls a 'nukeserver' function from an external module, which strongly suggests destructive behavior such as deleting or damaging server data or infrastructure. Additionally, the 'assign_operator' command imports and executes a function from 'forceop', which could be used to escalate privileges or take control over systems. The presence of commands like 'nukeserver' and 'forceop' indicates malicious intent, as they imply destructive actions or unauthorized control. Overall, the script appears designed to remotely trigger harmful operations, making it malicious.",
