      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits clear malicious intent by collecting sensitive user data from the victim's system without consent. It extracts Discord tokens, browser stored passwords, system information (including HWID), and potentially Minecraft account details. The data is then exfiltrated by sending it to multiple external URLs via HTTP POST requests, which are encoded in base64 and decoded at runtime, making detection more difficult. The code's purpose appears to be espionage, credential theft, and unauthorized surveillance, which are typical behaviors of malware or spyware. Additionally, the code does not perform any legitimate or benign functions, further confirming its malicious nature.",
