This action can leak sensitive information such as environment configurations, credentials, or other private data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code disguises this activity under the guise of a package setup script, which is a common tactic to evade detection. Such behavior is indicative of malicious intent aimed at data theft or reconnaissance.",
