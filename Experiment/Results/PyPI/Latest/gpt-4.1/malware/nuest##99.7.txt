      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during the installation of the package, arbitrary code from 'main' is executed, which could be malicious. Such behavior is often used to run malicious payloads, establish backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the target system. The code does not perform any visible or legitimate setup tasks related to the package itself, indicating that its primary purpose is likely to execute malicious code during installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, potentially for tracking, profiling, or malicious purposes. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and is designed to secretly transmit user and system data to external servers, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
