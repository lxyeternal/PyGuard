      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute a function `send_to_webhook()` immediately after the package installation completes, as part of a custom install command. This behavior suggests an attempt to trigger an external webhook without explicit user consent, which can be used for malicious purposes such as exfiltrating data, notifying an attacker of the installation, or executing arbitrary code remotely. Additionally, the presence of a console script entry point that directly calls `send_to_webhook()` further indicates an intent to execute code outside normal package functionality, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data leaks. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by automating external communication during or after installation, which is a common tactic in malicious package distribution.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to send a GET request to a specified webhook URL using the 'curl' command executed via subprocess. This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data or notify an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or unauthorized monitoring. The use of subprocess to invoke curl indicates an intent to perform network communication outside of standard Python libraries, which can be a tactic to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by establishing external communication that could be used for nefarious purposes.",
