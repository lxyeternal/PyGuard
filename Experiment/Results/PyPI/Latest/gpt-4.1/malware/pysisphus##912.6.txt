      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main.py', which could perform harmful actions such as executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized network connections, or compromising the system. The code's structure indicates an intent to execute potentially malicious code automatically during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and appear to be part of a command-and-control or data collection infrastructure, further suggesting malicious intent.",
