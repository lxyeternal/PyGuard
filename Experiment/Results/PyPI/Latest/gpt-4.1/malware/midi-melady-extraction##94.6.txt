      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (`CrazyInstallStrat`) that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a `main()` function from an external module named `main`. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the package installation phase, which can be exploited to run malicious code without user awareness. The code does not specify what `main()` does, but executing external code during installation is a common tactic used by malware to compromise systems or establish persistence. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed solely to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
