      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs a URL by decoding base64-encoded strings, which appear to be obfuscated. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL, appending the hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests the code is likely communicating with a remote server to exfiltrate information (the hostname) without user consent or awareness. Such activity is characteristic of malicious scripts used for command-and-control communication, data exfiltration, or tracking. The obfuscation via base64 encoding further indicates an intent to hide the true destination or purpose of the request, which is a common tactic in malicious code.",
