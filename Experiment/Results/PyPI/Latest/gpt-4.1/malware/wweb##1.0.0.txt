      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes an embedded payload using Fernet encryption. This payload is likely malicious, as it is hidden within the setup script and only executed during installation. The use of encryption, conditional execution based on OS, and dynamic code execution are common techniques in malicious installers to evade detection and run arbitrary malicious code on the target system.",
