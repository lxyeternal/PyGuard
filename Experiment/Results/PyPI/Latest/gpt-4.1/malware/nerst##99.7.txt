      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'main' function, which is executed automatically during installation. Such behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious scripts, potentially compromising the system or executing unwanted actions without user consent. The code's structure indicates an intent to hide malicious activity within the installation process, making it suspicious and potentially harmful.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs and sends HTTP requests to multiple external URLs with these details embedded as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by an attacker or used for data exfiltration. This behavior indicates the code is designed to secretly gather and transmit potentially sensitive user and system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or command-and-control communication.",
