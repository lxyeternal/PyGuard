      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard setup process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process, which can be exploited to run malicious code on the target system without explicit user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious or backdoored Python packages designed to compromise systems or perform unauthorized actions during installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or fingerprinting, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary function beyond information gathering and transmission, suggesting it is designed for malicious purposes such as tracking, profiling, or preparing for further exploitation.",
