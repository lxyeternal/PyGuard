      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to perform remote code execution by downloading and executing a payload from an external URL, which is likely malicious. It retrieves platform-specific scripts intended to establish reverse shells back to an attacker-controlled IP and port (10.0.0.1:4444). The payloads are fetched dynamically, modified to include the attacker's IP and port, and then executed in the background using subprocess.Popen. This behavior enables the attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system control, or further malicious activities. Additionally, packaging this code as a Python package with misleading metadata further facilitates its distribution and execution under the guise of legitimate software.",
