      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a comprehensive malware designed for data theft, system manipulation, persistence, and malicious injection. It performs extensive credential harvesting from browsers, social media, gaming platforms, and messaging apps, including extracting tokens, cookies, passwords, and sensitive files. It also includes modules for injecting malicious scripts into Discord, stealing files from user directories, and establishing persistence via startup mechanisms (registry, scheduled tasks, startup folders). Additionally, it contains anti-debugging and anti-VM checks to evade detection. The code exfiltrates all stolen data to a remote webhook or uploads it to file hosting services, facilitating unauthorized access and potential misuse of user credentials, personal files, and system information. Overall, it exhibits typical behaviors of a malicious info-stealer, remote access trojan, and persistence malware.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'cometlogger' with the description 'Comet Token Grabber'. The package name and description strongly suggest that it is intended to create a token grabber, which is a malicious tool designed to steal users' Discord tokens or other sensitive information. The keywords such as 'tokengrabber' and 'discord' further support this malicious intent. Although the script itself only contains setup configuration and does not perform malicious actions directly, it is likely part of a malicious payload intended to be distributed and used for stealing tokens or other private data from victims' systems.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a malicious builder or dropper script designed to generate various types of payloads (e.g., .exe, .ink, .scr, .py, .ini, .sys). It prompts the user for webhook URLs, which are likely intended for exfiltration or command-and-control purposes. The script then proceeds to build these payloads, potentially embedding the webhook URLs into them. Additionally, it calls an external executable 'utils/upx.exe' multiple times, which suggests it may be compressing or obfuscating the payloads to evade detection. The overall structure and behavior—collecting webhook URLs, building payloads, and possibly compressing them—are characteristic of malware distribution tools, especially those used for creating trojans, RATs, or other malicious payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious as it facilitates the creation and distribution of potentially harmful payloads intended for malicious use.",

This behavior indicates an injection or backdoor mechanism, potentially allowing remote control or malicious activity on the compromised system. The use of obfuscated code, dynamic file modifications, and process manipulation strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at hijacking or spying on Discord users.",

It actively checks for debugging tools, process monitors, and network indicators associated with analysis environments. Additionally, it terminates processes related to reverse engineering (e.g., Wireshark, Fiddler, Process Hacker) and checks system identifiers (HWID, username, hostname, IP, MAC) against blacklists, which could be used to prevent execution in sandbox or analysis environments. These behaviors suggest the code is designed to evade detection and analysis, characteristic of malicious software aiming to hide its presence and prevent reverse engineering.",

This behavior is characteristic of malware or potentially unwanted programs aiming to maintain persistent access, often used in malware campaigns to survive reboots and conceal their presence.

It gathers user details, hardware identifiers, system specifications, disk usage, network information, geolocation data, and Wi-Fi passwords.

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple behaviors indicative of malicious intent. It manipulates a Windows executable (likely a PyInstaller-compiled binary) by removing or altering metadata, signing it with a certificate (potentially a malicious or unauthorized certificate), and modifying its internal structure. Specifically, it replaces certain strings related to PyInstaller and timestamp data, which can be used to evade detection or analysis. The 'PumpStub' function appears to modify the executable's binary data by zeroing out parts of it, possibly to remove or alter embedded code or payloads. Additionally, 'RenameEntryPoint' changes the executable's entry point by replacing a known string with random data, potentially to obfuscate or hijack execution flow. These actions are characteristic of malware attempting to evade detection, tamper with executable integrity, or embed malicious payloads. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with common malware techniques aimed at obfuscation, evasion, and unauthorized modification of executables, indicating it is malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes. It reads an encrypted file ('blank.aes') from a temporary directory, decompresses and decrypts its contents, and then dynamically loads the decrypted module. This behavior suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads within encrypted and compressed data, which are only decrypted at runtime to evade static analysis. The use of AES-GCM encryption, zlib decompression, and dynamic module loading indicates an intent to conceal malicious code and execute it stealthily, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data theft, remote code execution, or system compromise.",

It appears to generate a payload that is obfuscated, encrypted, and compressed, then packaged into a file ('blank.aes') which is likely intended to be delivered or executed on a target system. The code includes functions to inject code dynamically from a remote URL, obfuscate and junk code to evade detection, and create encrypted payloads with AES-GCM, which suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities. Additionally, it manipulates system files, such as 'version.txt' and system directories, and attempts to extract version information from system executables, possibly for fingerprinting or evasion. The presence of functions like 'WriteSettings' that configure various modules (e.g., webcam capture, password theft, cookie theft, system info collection, fake error messages, Discord token theft, etc.) strongly indicates malicious intent, as these are common features in malware designed for data exfiltration, system compromise, or remote control. Overall, the code is designed to build, obfuscate, and encrypt malicious payloads, making it highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior.",
