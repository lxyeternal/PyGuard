This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code fetched from an external source, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as malware delivery, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The use of Base64 encoding obscures the URL and filename, further suggesting an intent to hide malicious intent. Overall, this script is designed to covertly download and execute potentially harmful code, making it malicious.",
