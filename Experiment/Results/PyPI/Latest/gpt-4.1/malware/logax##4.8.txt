      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated logic that retrieves a URL and filename via base64-encoded strings, downloads a file from the URL, executes it, and then deletes the file. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute remote code without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware download, or backdoor installation. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and dynamic behavior suggest an intent to hide malicious intent from casual inspection.",
