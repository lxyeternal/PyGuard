      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a remote URL ('https://blockatlaspro.com/test.py'), saves it to a hidden location within the user's AppData directory, and then executes it silently. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code fetched from an external source without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware distribution, or backdoor installation. The use of 'SetFileAttributesW' to set the file as hidden and suppressing output during execution further suggests an intent to conceal the malicious script's presence and activity.",
