      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an encoded URL and filename from base64 strings, decodes them, and then proceeds to download a file from the URL. If the download is successful, it executes the downloaded file without any validation or sandboxing, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious payload delivery, as it can be used to fetch and run malicious executables or scripts on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code's obfuscation via base64 encoding and the lack of any legitimate purpose strongly suggest malicious intent.",
