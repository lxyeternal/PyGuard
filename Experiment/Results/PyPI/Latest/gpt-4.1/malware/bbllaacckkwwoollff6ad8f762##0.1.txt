This behavior indicates data exfiltration, where the attacker is collecting system information and transmitting it without user consent. The code is embedded within a setup script and executes during installation, making it potentially malicious as it can silently gather sensitive system data and send it to an external server, which is characteristic of malicious or backdoor activity.",
