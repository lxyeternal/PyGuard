      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard installation process, imports and executes a 'main' function from an external module named 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded in 'main', which could perform harmful actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. The code's obfuscation of the malicious activity within the install process indicates malicious intent, as it leverages the setup script to execute potentially harmful code during package installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as host name, user name, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs under the '/realtime_p/pypi/' path with a random number parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information to external servers, potentially for malicious purposes such as surveillance, fingerprinting, or further exploitation.",
