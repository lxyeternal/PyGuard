      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation process, imports and executes a function named 'main' from a module called 'main'. This behavior suggests that during installation, arbitrary code can be executed without explicit user consent or awareness. Such a pattern is often used to run malicious payloads, establish persistence, or perform unauthorized actions on the target system. The code's structure and behavior are characteristic of malicious or potentially harmful software, especially since it executes code during the installation process.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious and likely serve as command-and-control or data collection endpoints, suggesting the script is designed to spy on the user or system.",
