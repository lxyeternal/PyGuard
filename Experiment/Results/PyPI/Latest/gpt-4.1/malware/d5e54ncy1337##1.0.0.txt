      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a malicious behavior known as a 'phone home' or data exfiltration mechanism. During installation, it collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This allows the attacker to gather potentially sensitive environment details without user consent or awareness, which can be used for further malicious activities such as targeted attacks, reconnaissance, or exploitation. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks related to the package itself, indicating its primary purpose is to secretly collect and transmit data.",
