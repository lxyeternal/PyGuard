      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation class that, during the package installation process, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent, potentially for tracking, profiling, or malicious purposes. The code does not perform any legitimate installation-related modifications or checks, and the external request to an IP address suggests malicious intent to gather system information surreptitiously.",
