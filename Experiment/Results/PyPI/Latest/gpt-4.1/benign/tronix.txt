      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate a private key by sending it via an HTTP POST request to an external server. The function 'perm' takes a private key as input, constructs a data structure containing the key, and then sends this data to a remote server ('https://68076f26e81df7060eba3e58.mockapi.io/tron'). This behavior indicates an attempt to steal sensitive information, which is malicious. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to the same server and checks the response, possibly to verify if the exfiltration was successful or to receive further instructions. Overall, this code is malicious as it aims to secretly transmit private data to an attacker-controlled server.",
