      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple behaviors indicative of malicious intent. It includes functions to remotely discover and connect to a command-and-control server via UDP broadcast and TCP connection, potentially allowing an attacker to control the compromised system. It can download and execute arbitrary software files, which could be used to install malware or unwanted programs. Additionally, it can modify system network settings and enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), potentially creating backdoors for unauthorized remote access. The use of toast notifications may serve as a distraction or confirmation of control. Overall, these capabilities—remote command execution, software installation, network configuration manipulation, and RDP enabling—are characteristic of remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, making this code malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functionalities that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating and deleting user accounts with administrative privileges, executing arbitrary PowerShell commands, and remotely controlling connected clients via a custom TCP server. It can disable or enable internet access on the host machine, install or uninstall software, and initiate remote desktop sessions. These capabilities, especially when misused, can compromise system security, facilitate unauthorized access, and perform malicious activities like installing malware, exfiltrating data, or maintaining persistence. The presence of remote command execution, user account manipulation, and network control features strongly indicates malicious intent or behavior.",

It can run arbitrary PowerShell commands, install software from specified paths, fix Windows system issues, and display toast notifications. These capabilities enable malicious actors to remotely manipulate the infected machine, execute arbitrary code, install potentially unwanted or malicious software, and perform system modifications without user consent. The presence of such remote command execution features and system modification functions strongly indicates malicious intent.",
