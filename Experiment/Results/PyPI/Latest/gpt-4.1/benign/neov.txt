This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive session data, which is often used to hijack user sessions or access private accounts. The use of a Telegram channel for data exfiltration is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection and facilitate remote data theft. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious intent by collecting potentially sensitive session files and transmitting them to an external entity.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches for files with specific extensions in a given directory and then uploads these files to a Telegram chat using a bot token. This behavior suggests data exfiltration, as it can be used to secretly collect and transmit potentially sensitive files without user consent. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and the automated sending of files to an external service are common indicators of malicious activity, especially if used without user knowledge or authorization.",
