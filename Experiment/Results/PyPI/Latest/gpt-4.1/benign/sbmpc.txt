      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a 'keylogger' module written in C++, which captures and logs keystrokes by monitoring keyboard input states and writing them to a file ('keylog.txt') in an infinite loop. This behavior is characteristic of malicious keylogging software designed to secretly record user activity without consent, potentially leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or other malicious uses. The presence of this keylogger code classifies the overall code as malicious. Other code snippets are primarily implementations of cryptographic algorithms, data structures, or UI components, which are benign in isolation, but the inclusion of the keylogger indicates malicious intent.",
