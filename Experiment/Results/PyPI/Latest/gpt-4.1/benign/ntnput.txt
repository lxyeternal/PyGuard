      "malicious_behavior": "The code provides functions to simulate low-level input events such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard presses by directly invoking undocumented or less commonly used Windows system calls (e.g., NtUserInjectMouseInput, NtUserInjectKeyboardInput). This capability can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as automating unauthorized input actions, controlling the user's system without their consent, or creating remote access tools (RATs). The use of direct system calls bypasses standard input APIs, making detection and monitoring more difficult, which is characteristic of malicious or stealthy software. Overall, the code appears designed to enable automated, potentially covert input injection, which is a common technique in malware and remote control tools.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code dynamically constructs and executes shellcode that performs a direct system call by manually setting up CPU registers and invoking the syscall instruction. It retrieves syscall IDs from Windows native functions (ntdll.dll), constructs a small machine code payload to invoke these syscalls, and executes it in memory. This technique is commonly used to bypass API hooks, evade detection, or perform low-level operations that are not easily monitored by standard security tools. Such behavior is characteristic of malware or rootkit-like activities aiming to perform privileged operations stealthily, making this code highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
