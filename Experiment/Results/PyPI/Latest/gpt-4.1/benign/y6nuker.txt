The package name and description strongly suggest that the tool is intended to perform destructive actions on Discord servers, such as mass deletion, spam, or other disruptive activities. While the setup script itself does not contain the malicious behavior directly, it indicates the presence of a tool designed for malicious purposes. Therefore, the code is associated with malicious intent, and the package is likely intended to be used for malicious activities targeting Discord communities.",
