      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a module named 'uaua.uauator' and then immediately calls a function named 'main' with the command-line arguments. The module name 'uaua.uauator' is suspicious and does not correspond to any known standard or reputable library, suggesting a possible typosquatted or malicious package. The code itself is minimal and does not show explicit malicious operations, but the use of a suspicious, likely obfuscated or malicious module combined with immediate execution of its main function on script start is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is typical in malware that hides its payload inside obscure or custom modules and triggers execution without user interaction or consent. Given the context and the suspicious import, this code likely serves as a loader or entry point for malicious behavior embedded in the imported module."
