      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. It includes functionality to discover a server on the network via UDP broadcast, connect to that server, and send the hostname, indicating silent host fingerprinting and potential control. It uses subprocess calls to execute PowerShell commands that change the network profile to Private and enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which can facilitate unauthorized remote access. The code downloads files from the connected server over TCP, saves them to the user's home directory, and executes them silently, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential payload delivery without user consent. The presence of a toast notification about the system being controlled by an administrator is likely a deceptive or minimal user notification. The combination of network discovery, remote connection, silent download and execution of software, and system configuration changes (enabling RDP and firewall rules) strongly indicates malicious intent, such as establishing persistent remote control and executing arbitrary payloads. There is no evidence of user consent, validation, or legitimate business logic justifying these actions. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
