      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, dynamically imports and executes a module named 'zip' from a local zip archive file 'zip.zip'. This is done via the standard Python zipimport and importlib mechanisms. The module's 'hello()' function is called during installation. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, file writing outside the package data, or execution of arbitrary or remote code. The dynamic import from a local zip file is unusual but can be a legitimate packaging technique to include resources or modules in a compressed form. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as base64 decoding, shell command execution, network calls, or environment variable harvesting are present. The package name 'code-beautifyer' is generic and not suspicious. The code reads a README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. Overall, the code does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics or key risk indicators outlined in the knowledge base."
