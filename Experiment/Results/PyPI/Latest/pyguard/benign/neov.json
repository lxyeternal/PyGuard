      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports two functions, find_files and send_file_to_telegram, from a relative module named '.pytzv'. It then searches the '/root' directory for files with the '.session' extension and, if any are found, sends each file to Telegram using send_file_to_telegram. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it targets a sensitive system directory ('/root'), searches for files with a '.session' extension which likely contain session or credential data, and exfiltrates these files over the network to Telegram without any user interaction or consent. The automated collection and transmission of potentially sensitive session files to an external service is a classic hallmark of malicious data exfiltration malware. The lack of any user notification, the targeting of sensitive files, and the network exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines functions to recursively find files with a given extension and send those files to a hardcoded Telegram chat via a bot token. The presence of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID used to exfiltrate files is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This code can be used to stealthily collect files from the victim's system and send them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account without user consent or notification. The lack of any user interaction, combined with automated file discovery and network exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint, matches typical malicious data exfiltration patterns. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware that steals user documents or sensitive files and sends them to attackers. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
