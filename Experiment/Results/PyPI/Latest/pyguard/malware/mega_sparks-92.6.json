      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code snippet itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically retrieved or encoded code. There is no evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or environment manipulation. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the main module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and sending it to non-standard, suspicious domains, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the domains used are not recognized as benign or trusted endpoints. Therefore, this code is performing automated, covert data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
