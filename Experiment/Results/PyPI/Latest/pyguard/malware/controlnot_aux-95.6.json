      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that overrides the standard install command to run additional code during installation. Specifically, it imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main' immediately after the package installation steps. While executing code during installation can be abused for malicious purposes (e.g., supply chain attacks), this code snippet itself does not show any direct evidence of malicious behavior such as obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, or suspicious file operations. The package metadata and dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') are common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to definitively assess the overall behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated, silent exfiltration of environment and user data to suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The base64 encoding of MAC addresses before transmission further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive host information without user consent."
