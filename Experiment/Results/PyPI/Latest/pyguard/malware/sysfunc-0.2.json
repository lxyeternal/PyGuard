      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts, which decrypt and execute the actual payload at runtime. Such obfuscation is often used to hide malicious behavior, including but not limited to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of Pyarmor runtime with encrypted payload, this code strongly indicates malicious intent or at least attempts to conceal its true functionality, which is a hallmark of malware or potentially unwanted programs."
