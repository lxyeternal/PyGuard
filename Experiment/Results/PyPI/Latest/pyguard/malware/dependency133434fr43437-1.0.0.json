      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that, during the installation process, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfop2kwz8m2bxoo.oast.fun), which is an attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction testing. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent, constituting automated data exfiltration. The use of a custom install hook in setuptools to perform network communication and exfiltrate system information is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external endpoint is not a known trusted service. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
