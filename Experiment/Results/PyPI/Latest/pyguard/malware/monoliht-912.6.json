      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear attacker-controlled and are not associated with any legitimate service. The use of randomized query parameters and encoding of environment data in the URL query string is a common technique to evade detection and exfiltrate data stealthily. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are unusual and likely malicious infrastructure. This pattern of automated environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential or environment information stealing malware."
