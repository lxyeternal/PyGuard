It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) during the package installation process (triggered by the on_install function linked in the setup entry_points). This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it constitutes automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The lack of user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic, combined with the hardcoded external server and automatic network communication, aligns with typical malware patterns for system fingerprinting and data theft. Therefore, this code is malicious."
