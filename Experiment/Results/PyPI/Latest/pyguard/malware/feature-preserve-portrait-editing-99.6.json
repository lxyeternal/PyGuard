      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function m() from a module named main without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution or payload delivery. The package name and metadata appear generic and do not provide legitimate context for executing code at install time. The immediate execution of code during installation without user consent or validation is strongly associated with malicious intent, as it can be used to run unauthorized or harmful actions on the user's system. This pattern is a well-known vector for malware in Python packages and is considered a critical risk indicator."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 to obfuscate the data. It then constructs HTTP GET requests to three hardcoded, base64-encoded URLs that decode to suspicious, non-standard domains not associated with legitimate services. The collected system information is sent silently and automatically to these external servers without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses via system commands (getmac on Windows, ifconfig on Linux/macOS) combined with base64 encoding and network exfiltration is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The obfuscation of URLs and data encoding further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code runs automatically when executed. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting, indicating that the code is malicious."
