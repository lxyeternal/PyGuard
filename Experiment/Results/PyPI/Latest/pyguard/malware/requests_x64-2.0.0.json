      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://send.tresorit.com/a#oPaBw2_7GrteEiXwSSI29g) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to the current working directory, and then immediately executes it silently (suppressing stdout and stderr). This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, as it automates retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The execution occurs automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check of the downloaded executable. The use of subprocess.run to execute a downloaded binary without any safeguards, combined with silent failure handling, strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name and metadata appear to mimic a legitimate package ('requests_x64'), which is a common tactic to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including remote executable download and execution during installation, lack of user consent, and use of suspicious URLs, confirming it is malicious."
