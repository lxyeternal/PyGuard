      "malicious_behavior": "The function confirm_transaction collects the wallet's private key material by calling wallet.secret().hex(), which exposes sensitive secret key data. It then sends this private key along with transaction details (from_token, to_token, amount, dex) as a plaintext message via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint and chat ID. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials (private keys) to an attacker-controlled external server without user consent or notification. Such direct collection and transmission of private keys is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The presence of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID used for data exfiltration further confirms malicious intent. The rest of the code consists of empty stub functions and imports unrelated to this behavior. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealing private keys and exfiltrating them over the network."
