      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses base64 decoding to hide its true content and immediately executes the decoded code using exec and compile, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique commonly used in malware. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes a script that performs a network request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r), reads its content, and executes it. Afterward, it attempts to start a new thread to execute a shell command that runs the downloaded code with a replaced file extension, indicating dynamic code execution from a remote source. This pattern of obfuscation, remote code fetching, dynamic execution, and threading for stealth is strongly associated with malicious behavior, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. There is no legitimate user interaction, validation, or transparency, and the code executes automatically upon import, which is typical of supply chain or installation-time malware."
