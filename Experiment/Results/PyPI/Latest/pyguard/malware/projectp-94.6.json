      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and transmission to suspicious endpoints, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, specifically automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting. The code does not perform any benign operations such as logging, user consent, or legitimate network communication. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
