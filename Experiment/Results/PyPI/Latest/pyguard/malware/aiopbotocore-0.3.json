      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system name (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of host identity information during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The code executes this data exfiltration in the install hook without any user interaction, validation, or legitimate business logic, indicating intent to stealthily collect and leak system information. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL controlled by an attacker further confirms malicious intent. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
