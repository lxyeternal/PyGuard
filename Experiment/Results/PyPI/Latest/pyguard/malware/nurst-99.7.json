      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code snippet itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or decoded code. There are no suspicious imports or hardcoded external URLs, no evidence of data exfiltration, no use of eval/exec, subprocess spawning, or other typical malicious behaviors. The package name 'nurst' is not obviously typosquatted or suspicious. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully guarantee safety, but based on this snippet alone, the code does not contain any direct malicious behavior or strong indicators of malware. It appears to be a benign use of setuptools customization to run code after installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent or notification. It then constructs URLs with these details encoded as query parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external domains that appear attacker-controlled (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, validation, or business logic justifying this behavior. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple obscure URLs further suggests evasion and data leakage attempts. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated, non-consensual collection and exfiltration of user and system information to hardcoded suspicious domains is a hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance components."
