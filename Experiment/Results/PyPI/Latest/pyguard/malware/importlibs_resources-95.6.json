      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 to obfuscate the data. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of user and environment information without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation technique in malware. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and not associated with legitimate services. The code also uses subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses, which is part of environment reconnaissance. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the data sent is sensitive and privacy-related. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of credential or environment data theft and exfiltration, making this code malicious."
