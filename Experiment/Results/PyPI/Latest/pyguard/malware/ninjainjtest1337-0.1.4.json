      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function get_shell that creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (default 10.0.0.1) on port 4242 and then redirects a shell (/bin/sh) stdin, stdout, and stderr to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows remote command execution on the victim machine. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (av9f3cmae8dr818jkwjzemvek5qxen2c.oastify.com) without any user interaction or legitimate business logic. The combination of reverse shell capability and network communication to a suspicious external domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code lacks any user notification or consent, does not perform any benign or legitimate application logic, and includes hardcoded suspicious URLs. These factors align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, backdoor creation, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."
