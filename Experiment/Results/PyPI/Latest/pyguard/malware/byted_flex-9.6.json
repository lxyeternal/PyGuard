      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. The package name 'byted-flex' and author information are generic and anonymous, which is suspicious. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key malicious indicator is the execution of arbitrary code at install time via the setup.py install hook, which is a known vector for malware to execute payloads on user systems during package installation. There is no indication of user notification, validation, or sandboxing before executing the main() function. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the targeting of non-standard, suspicious domains, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code performs environment reconnaissance and stealthily transmits potentially sensitive information to external servers, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the network activity is performed in the background, further supporting the classification as malicious."
