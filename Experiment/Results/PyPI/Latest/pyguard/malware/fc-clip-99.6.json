      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports a function m() from a module named main and executes it immediately without any user interaction or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware because it enables execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized code on the user's system at install time. The package name 'fc-clip' and author details appear generic and do not provide legitimacy. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The critical risk indicator here is the execution of arbitrary code during the install phase without user consent or validation, which is a known vector for malicious payload delivery and remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, obfuscated (base64-encoded) external URLs that appear suspicious and attacker-controlled. The network communication is done silently without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses via system commands (getmac on Windows, ifconfig on Linux/macOS) combined with base64 encoding and exfiltration to multiple external endpoints is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The obfuscation of URLs and the automated, background transmission of system identifiers strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with data exfiltration or reconnaissance behavior commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code runs automatically when executed. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
