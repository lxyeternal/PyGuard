      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects the local system's hostname and current username, concatenates them into a string, base64-encodes this string, and then constructs a DNS lookup command (nslookup) targeting a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain with the encoded data as a subdomain. This behavior is a classic example of covert data exfiltration, where system identifying information is sent to an external server without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, the execution of a shell command during installation, and the contact with a suspicious external domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks and malware that hijack package installation processes to perform stealthy reconnaissance and data leakage."
