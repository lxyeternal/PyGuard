      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses multiple layers of obfuscation: it reverses a base64-encoded string, decodes it, then decompresses it using zlib, and finally executes the resulting code with exec. This pattern of obfuscation combined with immediate execution of decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec on dynamically decoded and decompressed data without any validation or user interaction is a hallmark of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution hidden from static analysis. Such behavior is almost never found in benign software and is commonly used to conceal payloads that may perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further payload downloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
