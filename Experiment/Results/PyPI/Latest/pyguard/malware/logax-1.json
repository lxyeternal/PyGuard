      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded strings to obfuscate a remote URL from which it downloads a file (likely an executable) without user consent or notification. The downloaded file is saved to a path constructed dynamically and then executed silently via os.system. The code checks for a 'LICENSE' file marker to avoid repeated execution, indicating stealth and persistence mechanisms. The use of base64 decoding immediately followed by file download and execution is a classic malware pattern for payload delivery. The remote URL is hardcoded and obfuscated, pointing to an untrusted external source. There is no user interaction or validation before downloading and executing the remote payload, which is a critical risk. The code is designed to run automatically on initialization, targeting Windows platforms, further indicating intent to compromise the system without user knowledge. These behaviors align with known malware tactics such as remote code execution, payload staging, and stealth persistence."
