      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (3.36.68.86) on port 16000. It establishes a TCP connection and enters a loop where it receives commands from the remote server, executes them on the local system using subprocess.getoutput, and sends back the command output. This behavior enables an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. Such reverse shell functionality is a classic hallmark of malicious remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, allowing unauthorized control and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. The code lacks any legitimate user interaction, logging, or safeguards, and directly executes received commands, which is a critical security risk and strong indicator of malicious intent."
