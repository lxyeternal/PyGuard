      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, there is no evidence in this snippet of any obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and not suspicious by themselves. The code does not perform any file system writes, shell command execution, or environment variable manipulation within the shown snippet. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered after installation, but based solely on this code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network exfiltration of encoded system identifiers without consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are not standard or known update or telemetry servers, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints."
