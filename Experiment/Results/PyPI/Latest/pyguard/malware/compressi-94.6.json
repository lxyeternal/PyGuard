      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the automated network communication to suspicious endpoints strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious software."
