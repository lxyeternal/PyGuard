It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. There is no evidence in this snippet of any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package name and metadata are generic and do not indicate suspicious intent. The code does not perform any suspicious actions during installation beyond invoking a local function. Without additional context or the content of the 'main' module, this code alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to non-standard, suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are not recognized as trusted or benign. Such automated, covert data exfiltration is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
