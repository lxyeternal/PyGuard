      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools installation hook that executes automatically during package installation. In the PostInstallCommand class, the run method calls a function send() which downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) and saves it locally as 'ins42.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename), which on Windows will launch the executable without user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is downloaded and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine. The lack of any user interaction, validation, or integrity checks, combined with the automatic execution of a remote binary, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is not typical or legitimate in standard Python packages and is strongly associated with malware delivery and execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
