      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command hook. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded domain is non-standard and attacker-controlled, which strongly suggests data exfiltration or remote command-and-control communication. The use of a setuptools install hook to trigger network communication during installation is a known malicious technique to execute arbitrary code or collect system information stealthily. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with these network calls, and the package metadata is generic and likely fabricated. These factors combined indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain and port (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) without any user interaction or notification. The domain and port combination is unusual and not associated with any known legitimate service. This pattern of contacting a hardcoded, attacker-controlled external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it may be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or downloading further malicious payloads. The absence of any legitimate context, validation, or user consent, combined with the direct network communication to a suspicious endpoint, aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns observed in malware. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious."
