      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of arbitrary or remote code. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. The import of requests is standard and not used in the snippet. Without the content of the main module, no direct malicious behavior can be confirmed. Based on the given code alone, it does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics such as executing code from untrusted sources, exfiltrating data, or obfuscation. Therefore, this code is not malicious by itself."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then constructs URLs with these details encoded as query parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external domains that appear attacker-controlled (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error recovery further supports this conclusion. Such behavior aligns with known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration, which are critical risk indicators of malicious activity."
