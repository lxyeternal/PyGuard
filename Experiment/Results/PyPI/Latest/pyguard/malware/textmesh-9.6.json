      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. Executing code at install time without explicit user consent or clear business logic is strongly associated with malicious intent, as it can be used to run payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'textmesh' and author information are generic and anonymous, which is common in malicious packages attempting to disguise themselves. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', libraries often used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, further raising suspicion. Overall, the automatic execution of arbitrary code during installation, without validation or user consent, is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This data collection and exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the hardcoded suspicious endpoints, strongly indicates malicious intent. The behavior matches known malware patterns of environment reconnaissance and automated data exfiltration to external command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident in the code, and the domains used are not recognized as benign or trusted. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious software."
