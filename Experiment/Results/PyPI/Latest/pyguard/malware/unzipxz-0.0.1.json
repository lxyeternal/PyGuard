      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. It imports the 'requests' module to perform network communication and uses base64 decoding to obfuscate a URL string. The decoded string is a suspicious, hardcoded URL pointing to a Discord webhook endpoint, which is commonly used by malware to exfiltrate data covertly. The function 'h(i,d)' sends an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL with arbitrary data, indicating a capability to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL and the immediate preparation for data exfiltration without any user interaction or legitimate business logic strongly suggests malicious intent. There is no benign context or legitimate use case for silently sending data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL in this manner. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
