      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external server is contacted automatically, which may be used for environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or remote command and control. The package name 'awsgluedq' appears suspicious and could be a typosquatting attempt. The use of a setuptools install hook to run network communication is a known vector for malicious payload delivery and remote code execution. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with these network calls, which strongly suggests malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq) without any user interaction or legitimate context. The domain and port are suspicious and not associated with known benign services. This pattern of contacting an external, attacker-controlled server silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. Although the code snippet is minimal and does not show further actions, the presence of a direct network call to a suspicious endpoint without validation or user consent aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware."
