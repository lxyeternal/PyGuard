      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of user and environment information without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the targeting of non-standard, suspicious domains, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs automatically when executed. These factors align with known malware patterns for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
