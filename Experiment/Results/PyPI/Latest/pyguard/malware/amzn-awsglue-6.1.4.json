      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command hook. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded domain is non-standard and attacker-controlled, which strongly suggests data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The automatic network communication during install, combined with the override of the setuptools install command to run this network request, is a hallmark of malicious behavior in Python packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code does not perform any benign or expected setup tasks. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and classified as malicious."
