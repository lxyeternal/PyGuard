      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and, upon installation, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or legitimate purpose. Executing such network communication during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration, combined with the lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."
