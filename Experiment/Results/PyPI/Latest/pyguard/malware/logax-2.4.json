      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a base64-encoded URL and saves it with a base64-decoded filename, then executes this file without any user interaction or validation. The URL and filename are obfuscated using base64 encoding, which is a common evasion technique. The downloaded file is executed via subprocess.run with shell=True, enabling arbitrary code execution. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery or remote code execution. The code also suppresses errors silently and performs no legitimate business logic or user notification, further indicating malicious intent."
