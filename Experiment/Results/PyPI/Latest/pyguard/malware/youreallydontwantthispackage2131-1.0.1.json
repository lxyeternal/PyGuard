      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token) without user consent, then immediately sends this sensitive token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled external URL (https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The package name and author email are suspicious and likely designed to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this network activity. The use of setuptools install hooks to run arbitrary shell commands that leak sensitive tokens to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
