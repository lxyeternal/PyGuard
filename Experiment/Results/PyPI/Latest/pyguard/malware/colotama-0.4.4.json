      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code immediately after installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, in the custom install class, the run method calls a _post_install function that executes a subprocess call running a Python script or executable named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where code execution is triggered during package installation, enabling arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The subprocess call uses shell=True with a constructed command string, which can be abused for command injection or running malicious payloads. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this post-install execution. Such automatic execution of code during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or steal information. The package name 'colotama' and author details do not provide any known benign context, and the pattern of executing a script from the install directory immediately after installation is a hallmark of supply chain malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
