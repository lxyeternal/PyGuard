      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables persistent execution of potentially untrusted remote code on the user's system without any user interaction or consent. The code performs network communication during package installation, writes files to user home directories, and sets up automatic execution of downloaded code on shell startup. These are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before downloading and scheduling execution of the remote script. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution, persistence, and potential further payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
