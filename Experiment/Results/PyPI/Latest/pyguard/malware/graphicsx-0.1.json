      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64', then decodes a base64-encoded string which is reversed, decompresses it using zlib, and immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (reversing, base64 decoding, zlib decompression) followed by direct execution is a classic hallmark of malicious code used to hide payloads and evade detection. The absence of any user interaction, the use of exec on dynamically decoded data, and the obfuscation strongly indicate that the code is executing hidden, potentially harmful instructions. Such behavior is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources, often used for payload delivery, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
