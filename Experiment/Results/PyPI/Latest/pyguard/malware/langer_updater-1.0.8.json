      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class LangInstall that overrides the run method to execute a function test() before proceeding with the normal installation. The test() function uses zipimport to load a module named 'my' from a local file 'my.zip', then executes a function hello() from that module. This is a form of dynamic code loading from a local zip archive during package installation. However, there is no evidence of network communication, obfuscated or encoded payloads, execution of remote or untrusted code, or any suspicious file system or environment manipulation. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, credential theft, or shell command execution. The use of dynamic import here appears to be for modularity or packaging reasons rather than malicious intent. The package metadata and structure do not indicate typosquatting or suspicious naming. Overall, while dynamic code execution during install can be a risk vector, this specific code does not exhibit the typical malicious patterns or behaviors outlined in the knowledge points."
