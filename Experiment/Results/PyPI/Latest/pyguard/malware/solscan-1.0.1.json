      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from a hardcoded external URL (a GitHub raw content URL) into a temporary directory, extracts it, and then attempts to execute a binary named 'config2.exe' from the extracted contents without any user interaction or validation. The use of subprocess.Popen to silently execute an external executable downloaded at runtime from a remote source is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution of potentially untrusted payloads. The code suppresses all output and errors from the executed process, further indicating stealthy execution. The temporary directory and files are cleaned up afterward, which is typical for malware trying to evade detection. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user consent, or integrity checks on the downloaded content. This pattern—automated download and execution of a remote binary in a temporary location without user notification—is strongly associated with malicious activity such as payload delivery, remote code execution, or malware staging."
