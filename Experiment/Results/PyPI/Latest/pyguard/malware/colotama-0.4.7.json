      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code immediately after installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, in the custom install class, after the normal installation process, it runs a post-install function that calls a subprocess executing a file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory using the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation. The subprocess call uses shell=True with a constructed command string, which can be abused for command injection or running arbitrary code. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this execution. Such automatic execution of a potentially untrusted file during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads on the victim system. This pattern aligns with known high-risk and critical-risk indicators for malicious Python packages that hijack installation hooks to run unauthorized code."
