      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded URL is not a known trusted endpoint and the package name mimics a legitimate AWS-related package, which is a common typosquatting or impersonation tactic. The automatic network communication during install, combined with overriding the setuptools install command to run additional code, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution or data exfiltration during installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code does not perform any benign setup tasks. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain and port (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) without any user interaction or legitimate context. The domain and port combination is unusual and not associated with known trusted services. This pattern of contacting a hardcoded, attacker-controlled external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it may be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. Although the code snippet itself only shows a GET request, the presence of such a suspicious network call without any benign context or user consent aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including contacting suspicious domains and automated network communication. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
