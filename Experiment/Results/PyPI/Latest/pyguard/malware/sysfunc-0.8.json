      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts, which decrypt and execute the actual code at runtime. Such obfuscation is often used to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized code execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and the use of Pyarmor runtime with an encrypted payload, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, as it conceals its true functionality and may execute arbitrary or harmful code without user consent or visibility."
