      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools setup script that includes a function run_after_install which decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it using exec. The base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' decodes to 'print(\"test\")', which is benign in this example. However, the pattern of embedding base64-encoded code and executing it dynamically during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. This technique is strongly associated with malware because it enables arbitrary code execution at install time, potentially without user consent or awareness. The use of exec on decoded data without validation or sanitization is a critical risk indicator. Even though the decoded payload here is harmless, the structure and method used are typical of malicious packages that deliver obfuscated payloads during installation. Therefore, this code exhibits a strong indicator of malicious intent due to the use of base64 decoding combined with exec in a setuptools install hook."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, which is then decoded and immediately executed using exec. This pattern of decoding base64-encoded data and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to hide and run arbitrary or harmful code. Although the decoded payload here is simply print(\"test\"), the use of exec on base64-decoded data without any validation or user interaction is a classic hallmark of malware or malicious scripts. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution are rarely used in benign software due to the inherent security risks."
