      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, subprocess, base64, sqlite3) and uses base64 decoding to hide multiple hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious external endpoints (discordapp.com API webhooks). The functions __sys__ and __dscan__ collect sensitive system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, IP address, and Discord tokens from local storage directories. The __browser__ function attempts to extract Chrome browser saved passwords from the local SQLite 'Login Data' database, encoding them in base64. The __mc__ function reads Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. The __exfil__ function sends collected sensitive data (system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft credentials) to multiple attacker-controlled webhook URLs via HTTP POST requests. The SetTerminalColor function triggers this exfiltration without any user interaction or notification. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64-encoded URLs and generic function/variable names to hide intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent for data collection or transmission. The overall pattern matches known credential-stealing malware that silently harvests sensitive user data and exfiltrates it to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code is malicious."
