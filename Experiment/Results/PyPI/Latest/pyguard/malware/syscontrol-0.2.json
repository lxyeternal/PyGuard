      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior in the Subsys.status method. Specifically, it uses base64 decoding combined with dynamic code execution via exec and compile on decoded data. The decoded base64 string corresponds to code that imports NamedTemporaryFile and executable from tempfile and sys modules, then uses urllib.request to open a hardcoded suspicious URL ('http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DATDTcxiSvq9OA6r'), reads its content, and executes it immediately. This pattern of fetching remote code from an untrusted, hardcoded IP address and executing it dynamically is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true nature of the code, combined with immediate execution without user consent or validation, strongly indicates malicious intent. No legitimate business logic or user interaction justifies this behavior. Therefore, the code is malicious."
