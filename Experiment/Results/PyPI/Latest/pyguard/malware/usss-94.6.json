      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package name 'usss' and author information are generic but not suspicious by themselves. The install_requires includes common libraries 'requests' and 'psutil', which are legitimate dependencies. There is no evidence in this snippet of malicious behavior such as executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources, exfiltrating data, or performing stealthy operations. Without the content of the 'main' module and its main() function, it is not possible to fully guarantee safety, but based on this setup.py code alone, it does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this collected information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic associated with this data collection and transmission, indicating covert data exfiltration. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network communication to unknown endpoints strongly aligns with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
