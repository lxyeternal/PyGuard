      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the automated network communication to unknown endpoints strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the pattern matches known indicators of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting used by malware."
