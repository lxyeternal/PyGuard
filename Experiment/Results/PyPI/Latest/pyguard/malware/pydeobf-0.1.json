      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform actions during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, external GitHub URL directly into the current working directory without user consent or validation. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This sequence of downloading and executing an untrusted binary during installation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The lack of user interaction, absence of integrity checks, and execution of a potentially harmful executable during install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
