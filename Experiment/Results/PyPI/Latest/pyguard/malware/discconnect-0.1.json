      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, automatically downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using the Windows API call WinExec without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation. The absence of any integrity checks, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the direct download and execution of a remote binary, strongly indicates that this code is designed to deploy and run potentially harmful payloads on the victim's system. Such automated, silent execution of untrusted code during installation is a critical security risk and is exclusively associated with malware."
