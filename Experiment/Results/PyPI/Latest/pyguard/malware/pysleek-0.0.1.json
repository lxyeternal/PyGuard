      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'zwerve.exe' from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/zwerve.exe) directly into the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of automated downloading and execution of a remote binary without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands to download and run an untrusted executable, combined with the lack of any integrity checks, user prompts, or sandboxing, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is consistent with high-risk malware patterns involving multi-stage attacks, remote payload delivery, and stealth execution."
