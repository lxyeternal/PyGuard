      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation strategy for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then calls a main() function imported from a module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization tasks. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscated code, network communication, file system manipulation, dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), or other suspicious behaviors commonly associated with malicious code. The package name 'shadokv' and versioning do not appear suspicious or typosquatted. The code imports only standard setuptools modules and the 'requests' package as a dependency, which is common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is impossible to fully guarantee the absence of malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple external endpoints further suggests attempts to evade detection or ensure data delivery. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains are not associated with known trusted services. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated, non-interactive data exfiltration of user and system information to hardcoded suspicious domains is a hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance behavior."
