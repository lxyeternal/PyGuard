      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that executes automatically during package installation. In the overridden run() method, it collects environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA) which likely contain sensitive information. It then executes shell commands to gather system information: hostname, current user (whoami), and network configuration (ifconfig), appending this data to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Subsequently, it appends the collected environment variable values to the same file. Finally, it exfiltrates this combined data by sending an HTTP POST request with the file as form data to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, system information gathering, writing to a temporary file, and silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of os.system to run shell commands and curl for data exfiltration further confirms the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to gather sensitive system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment discovery and automated data exfiltration to a suspicious, hardcoded external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or information-exfiltration malware. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, which appears benign, but the presence of this covert data collection and exfiltration in the constructor means that any instantiation of EOSIOKey will leak sensitive host information to an attacker-controlled server."
