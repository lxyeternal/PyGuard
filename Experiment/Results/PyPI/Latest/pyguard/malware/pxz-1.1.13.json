      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hooks into the package installation process via a custom install command. During installation, it automatically collects system information including the public IP address (queried from an external service), the hostname, the user's home directory, the current working directory, and the current time. It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system information without user consent or notification. The use of a setuptools install hook to trigger this network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded external server IP and the nature of the data collected (system identifiers and environment details) strongly indicate malicious intent, as this information can be used for fingerprinting, tracking, or further targeted attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and supply chain compromise."
