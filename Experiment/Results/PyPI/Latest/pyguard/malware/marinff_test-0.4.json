      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that creates a reverse shell connecting back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) and port (1234). This payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during the install process. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, the immediate execution of decoded shell commands, and the establishment of a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled host are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Such code enables remote code execution and unauthorized access to the victim system, posing a critical security risk."
