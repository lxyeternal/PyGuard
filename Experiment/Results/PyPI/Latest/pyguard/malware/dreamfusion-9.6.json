      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a form of obfuscation. Then, it sends this collected and encoded information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and transmission to suspicious endpoints, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, specifically automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting. The code does not perform any benign or transparent operations and silently sends sensitive information to external servers, which is a hallmark of malware or spyware."
