      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network communication to suspicious endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration."
