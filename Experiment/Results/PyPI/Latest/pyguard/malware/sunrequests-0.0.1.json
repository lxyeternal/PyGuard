      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract saved passwords from multiple popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox) on a Windows system by accessing browser-specific data files and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs and browser encryption keys. It collects sensitive user credentials including URLs, usernames, and decrypted passwords, writes them into CSV files named with the browser and the victim's IP address, and then exfiltrates these files by sending them to a hardcoded Telegram bot via its API. This automated credential theft and exfiltration without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically credential-stealing malware. The use of Windows cryptographic APIs (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt stored passwords, copying browser database files to avoid locks, and sending the stolen data over the network to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot token and chat ID further confirms the malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior, and the code runs automatically on execution, silently collecting and transmitting sensitive data. Therefore, this code is malicious."
