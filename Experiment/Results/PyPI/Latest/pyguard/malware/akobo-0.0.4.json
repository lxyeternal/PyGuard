This behavior is suspicious because it silently sends an HTTP GET request to an external, attacker-controlled webhook URL without any user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic. Such immediate network communication to a hardcoded webhook during package setup or import is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or tracking, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The rest of the code is a typical setuptools setup script, but the presence of this subprocess call to an external webhook URL during setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
