      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command hook. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external server is contacted automatically, which can be used for data exfiltration, remote command and control, or payload delivery. The package name 'amzn-awsglue' mimics a legitimate AWS service, which is a common typosquatting or impersonation tactic to deceive users. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification around these network calls, and the code leverages setuptools install hooks to execute code at install time, a known vector for malicious activity. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain and port (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue) without any user interaction or legitimate context. The domain and port combination is unusual and not associated with known benign services. This pattern of contacting a hardcoded, attacker-controlled external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, often used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling further supports the classification as malicious behavior."
