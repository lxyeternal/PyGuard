      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, network communication, file system manipulation, or other suspicious behavior. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully guarantee safety, but based on this code alone, it does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics or key risk indicators outlined in the knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. The encoded data along with other system information is sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration without any user interaction or consent. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with network transmission of encoded system identifiers to unknown external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further supporting the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data collection and exfiltration."
