      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (a sensitive credential endpoint) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c100b39f-8d06-40c4-bc5f-64e251fcc6ad). This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration of sensitive data. The execution occurs automatically during package installation or setup phases, without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL for exfiltration, combined with the retrieval of sensitive tokens from a cloud metadata service, confirms the code's malicious intent."
