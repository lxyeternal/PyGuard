      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to run arbitrary code on the victim's system. The package name and metadata appear suspicious and meaningless, further supporting malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead executes hidden code, which could perform any number of harmful actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system."
