      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute malicious actions during package installation. It contains an obfuscated payload represented as a list of integers, which is decoded by subtracting 30 from each integer and converted to characters to form a Python script. This decoded script is then written to /tmp/xxx.py without user consent or notification. Subsequently, the code executes a reverse shell command ('python3 /tmp/xxx.py') by encoding it in base64 and decoding it in a shell command, effectively establishing a reverse shell connection. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation to gain remote code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution of a reverse shell without user interaction or validation are strong indicators of malicious intent."
