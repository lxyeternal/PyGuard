      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Then, it sends this collected information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated, silent exfiltration of system identifiers to unknown external servers is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive host information without user consent."
