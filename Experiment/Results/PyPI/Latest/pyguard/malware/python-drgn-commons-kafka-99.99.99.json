      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command and executes automatically during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code executes this data collection and network transmission silently during install time, which is unexpected and suspicious for a legitimate package. The presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL, the automated gathering of sensitive environment data, and the immediate network exfiltration during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
