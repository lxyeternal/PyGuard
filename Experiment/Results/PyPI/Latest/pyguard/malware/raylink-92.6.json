      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity information and the transmission to non-standard, suspicious domains, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality and is consistent with patterns of information-stealing malware that fingerprint the host and exfiltrate data to command-and-control servers."
