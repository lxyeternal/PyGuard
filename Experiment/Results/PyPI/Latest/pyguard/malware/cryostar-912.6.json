      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code snippet itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. Without the content of the main module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively assess maliciousness, but based solely on this setup script, there are no direct indicators of malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (not standard or reputable endpoints). The use of randomized query parameters and the transmission of user and system identifiers to unknown remote servers is a classic pattern of data exfiltration and host fingerprinting commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are not associated with known benign services. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, specifically automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system information to suspicious external servers."
