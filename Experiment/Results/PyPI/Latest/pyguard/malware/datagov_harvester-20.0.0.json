      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class that automatically collects detailed system information including hostname, platform details, installation path, network IP addresses, and domain names without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for data collection or exfiltration. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: automated system fingerprinting, silent data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, and lack of any legitimate user notification or business logic. The code does not perform any benign or user-driven operations and is designed to stealthily gather and transmit sensitive environment and network information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance or information-stealing malware."
