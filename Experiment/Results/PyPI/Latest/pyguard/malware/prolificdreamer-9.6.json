      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code snippet itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and not inherently suspicious. Without the content of the main module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively assess the full behavior, but based solely on this setup.py snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points. The use of a post-install hook is not unusual in Python packages, and no suspicious or high-risk indicators (such as obfuscated code, remote code execution, or data exfiltration) are present here."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. The script constructs URLs with hardcoded suspicious domains that appear attacker-controlled and sends HTTP GET requests containing the collected sensitive information as URL parameters. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and transmission to multiple suspicious external endpoints, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, consistent with command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
