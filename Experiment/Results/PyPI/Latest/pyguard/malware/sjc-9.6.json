      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of user and environment information without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the lack of legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the targeting of suspicious external endpoints, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are consistent with reconnaissance or credential-stealing malware that fingerprints the host and leaks system identifiers to a command-and-control server."
