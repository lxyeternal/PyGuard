      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation are typical characteristics of supply chain attacks and malware. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden code, which could perform arbitrary malicious actions on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
