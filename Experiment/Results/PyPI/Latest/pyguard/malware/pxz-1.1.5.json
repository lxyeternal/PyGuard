It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, likely attacker-controlled IP address and port (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php) during package installation. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration and system fingerprinting, which is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. The execution of this data collection and exfiltration code at install time (outside of any user-triggered action) further confirms malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, and the hardcoded private IP address suggests a staging or attacker-controlled server. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system information during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
