      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP address (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code executes shell commands to gather data, performs network communication to an external endpoint during install time, and does so silently without any legitimate user interaction or business logic. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with automatic execution during package installation, strongly indicates malicious intent."
