      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the automated, silent exfiltration of environment and user data to suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The base64 encoding of MAC addresses before exfiltration further indicates an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting without user consent."
