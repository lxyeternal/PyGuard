      "malicious_behavior": "The code automatically collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, fully qualified domain name, operating system details, Python version, installed path, current working directory, and a timestamp without any user interaction or consent. It then silently sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike), which is a known service often used for capturing and analyzing HTTP requests and can be abused by attackers for data exfiltration. The immediate and automated exfiltration of potentially sensitive system metadata to an external endpoint without notification or authorization is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with data exfiltration or reconnaissance behavior commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic, user prompt, or error handling that would justify this behavior in benign software. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior related to unauthorized telemetry collection and data exfiltration."
