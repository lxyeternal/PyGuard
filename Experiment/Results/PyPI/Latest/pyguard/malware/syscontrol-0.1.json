      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior in the Subsys.status method. Specifically, it uses base64 decoding combined with dynamic code execution via exec and compile on decoded data. The decoded base64 string corresponds to code that imports NamedTemporaryFile and executable from tempfile and sys modules, then uses urllib.request to open a hardcoded suspicious URL ('http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DATDTcxiSvq9OA6r'), reads its content, and executes it dynamically. This pattern of fetching remote code from an untrusted, hardcoded IP address and executing it without validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true nature of the code further confirms malicious intent. No legitimate business logic or user interaction is present before this execution, and the rest of the class methods appear benign or mock implementations. Therefore, the presence of this dynamic remote code execution makes the entire code malicious."
