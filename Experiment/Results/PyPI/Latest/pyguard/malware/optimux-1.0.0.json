      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after the standard installation process, executes a shell command via os.system. This shell command uses curl to send a POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://enj2782rxwxl.x.pipedream.net/) containing sensitive system information: the current username (whoami), hostname, present working directory (pwd), and the public IP address (retrieved via curl to ifconfig.me). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential theft, host fingerprinting, and data exfiltration malware."
