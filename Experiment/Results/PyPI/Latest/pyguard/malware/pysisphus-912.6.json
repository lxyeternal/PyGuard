      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to unknown external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple obscure domains further suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code performs automated network communication to suspicious endpoints, which aligns with known malware patterns for reconnaissance and data exfiltration."
