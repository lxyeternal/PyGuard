      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function get_shell that creates a reverse shell by opening a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (default 10.0.0.1) on port 4242 and redirects a shell's stdin, stdout, and stderr to this socket, effectively allowing remote command execution. Although this function is not called directly in the code, the presence of such a reverse shell function is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (av9f3cmae8dr818jkwjzemvek5qxen2c.oastify.com) with a timestamped URL path, which is typical of malware performing beaconing or data exfiltration. The combination of a reverse shell capability and network communication to a suspicious external server without any user interaction or legitimate business logic strongly indicates malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware characteristics such as remote code execution, command and control communication, and potential backdoor installation."
