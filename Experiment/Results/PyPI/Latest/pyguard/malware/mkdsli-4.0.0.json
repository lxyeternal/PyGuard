      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to execute network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded, non-standard domain and the lack of any user interaction or notification further indicate malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong indicator of malware, specifically a supply chain attack that collects and exfiltrates sensitive environment data during package installation."
