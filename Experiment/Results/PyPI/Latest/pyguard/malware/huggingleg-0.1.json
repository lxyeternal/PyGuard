      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, changes its permissions to executable, and then runs it in the background with nohup. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malware. It involves arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, lacks any user interaction or notification, and uses direct shell execution to run potentially harmful payloads. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, including payload delivery, remote code execution, and system compromise."
