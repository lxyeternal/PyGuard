      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) and port (1234), encodes this command in base64, then immediately decodes and executes it via a shell command. This behavior enables remote code execution and unauthorized remote access to the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, execution of shell commands during installation, and the establishment of a reverse shell are all hallmark indicators of malicious activity, consistent with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). There is no legitimate reason for such code to run automatically during package installation, and it poses a critical security risk."
