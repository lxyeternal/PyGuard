      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command by defining a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during the package installation process. Specifically, after running the normal install routine, it imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main'. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The package name 'huggingfaces_hub' and version '95.6' do not correspond to the official Hugging Face package, suggesting possible typosquatting or impersonation. The code's behavior of executing arbitrary code at install time, especially via a custom install command, is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator. Without the source of the 'main' module, the exact payload is unknown, but the installation hook itself is a known vector for malicious payload delivery and remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and sending it to unknown external servers, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident in the code, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
