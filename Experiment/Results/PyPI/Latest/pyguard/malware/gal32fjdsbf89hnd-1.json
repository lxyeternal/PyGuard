      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata server for a specific service account and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a). This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive credentials without user consent. The execution of this command is automatic during installation phases, with no user interaction or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook for token exfiltration, combined with the automatic execution in setuptools hooks, is a classic supply chain attack pattern and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
