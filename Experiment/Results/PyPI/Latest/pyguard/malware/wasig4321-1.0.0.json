      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, username, operating system type, and executes multiple shell commands to gather sensitive system details such as IP addresses, CPU model, memory usage, disk usage, and network configuration. This information is then sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://00ymg2fcpil5571bhtc00slwfnli98xx.oastify.com), which is likely attacker-controlled. The behavior of silently collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system and user information during package installation is a hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is not a known trusted endpoint. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, use of setuptools install hooks for code execution, and contacting suspicious external servers. Therefore, the code is malicious."
