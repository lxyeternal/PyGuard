      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches base64-encoded encrypted data from a remote URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt), decrypts it using a hardcoded secret key with nacl.secret.SecretBox, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec. This pattern of downloading, decrypting, and executing remote code at runtime without any validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The execution occurs during the import phase of the setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and encryption), remote code retrieval from a suspicious GitHub repository, and immediate execution without transparency or safeguards aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
