      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup phase that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63), makes it executable, and runs it in the background without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation. The use of os.system to run a bash command that downloads and executes a remote binary without validation or user notification is strongly associated with malware. The IP address is hardcoded and not related to any legitimate PyTorch distribution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code execution from untrusted sources, execution during install time, lack of user consent, and use of shell commands to download and run potentially harmful payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, changes its permissions to executable, and then runs it in the background with nohup. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. It involves arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, lacks any user interaction or notification, and uses direct shell command execution to run potentially harmful payloads. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, including remote access trojans, backdoors, or other forms of system compromise."
