      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded strings to hide a remote URL from which it downloads a file (likely an executable) without user consent or notification. The downloaded file is saved to a path derived from the script's directory and then executed directly via os.system, enabling arbitrary code execution. The code checks for a marker in a LICENSE file to avoid repeated execution, indicating stealth or persistence behavior. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the download URL and the downloaded file name, combined with automatic download and execution of remote code, is a classic malware pattern. There is no user interaction or validation before downloading and running the external payload, which is a critical risk. The code runs automatically on import (via initialize()), targeting Windows platforms specifically, further indicating targeted malicious intent. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and stealth persistence, confirming the code is malicious."
