      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that executes a shell command ('id') during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. It collects the output of this command, encodes it in base64 (with padding characters removed), and sends it via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com). This behavior is a classic example of automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification, and the execution of shell commands in the install hook strongly indicate malicious intent. Such code can be used to stealthily collect system information from victims installing the package and send it to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain compromise."
