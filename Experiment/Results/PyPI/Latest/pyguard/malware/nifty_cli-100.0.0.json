      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it hooks into the Python package installation process via a custom install command class (CustomInstallCommand) that triggers a network request to an obfuscated external webhook URL during installation. The webhook URL is obfuscated using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, which is a form of code obfuscation to hide the true destination. The code collects the host user's environment variable USER without user consent and sends it along with the package name to the decoded webhook URL via an HTTP GET request. This automatic, silent exfiltration of user environment information during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. The presence of obfuscation, network communication to a hardcoded external endpoint, and execution of this behavior during the install phase without user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
