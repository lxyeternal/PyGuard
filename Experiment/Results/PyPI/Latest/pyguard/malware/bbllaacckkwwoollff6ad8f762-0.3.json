      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools installation process via a custom install command class, causing execution of code during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects the current username from the host system, which is sensitive environment information. If the username matches a specific value ('modelarts'), it executes a shell command to list the contents of the '/run/secrets/' directory, which is a location typically containing sensitive secret files or credentials in containerized or cloud environments. The output of this command is then base64-encoded (with padding characters removed) and sent via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server URL ('blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com'). This sequence of environment reconnaissance, sensitive data collection, obfuscation via base64 encoding, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to steal secrets or credentials. Additionally, commented-out code suggests the capability to fetch and execute remote code dynamically, further indicating potential for remote code execution and payload delivery. The package name is suspicious and likely designed to evade detection. Overall, the code abuses the Python package installation process to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information, which is a critical security risk and confirms malicious intent."
