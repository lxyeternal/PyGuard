      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects environment variables and system environment information using os.environ and subprocess calls to 'env' and 'cat /proc/self/environ'. It then encodes this sensitive environment data in base64 and sends it via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://csnr59g8cumhnf5tp4f0icgnzge434rpa.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of automated environment data collection and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing malware. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent further supports this conclusion. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external domain is non-standard and likely attacker-controlled. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration and is malicious."
