      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. Such execution can be used to run malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. The package name 'bytedplus' and version '99.7' do not provide any indication of legitimacy, and the installation hook runs code automatically, which is a critical risk pattern exclusively observed in malware. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic before executing main() further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, aligns with known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Although the code does not execute remote code or write files, the automated, non-interactive transmission of sensitive system information to attacker-controlled servers classifies this as malicious."
