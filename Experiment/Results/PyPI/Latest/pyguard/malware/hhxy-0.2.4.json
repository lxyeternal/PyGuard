      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (https://hhxy01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/PFAI.sh) without any user interaction or validation, then changes its permissions to executable and runs it immediately. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code without user consent or integrity checks is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, which is a common vector for malware delivery, including payload execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration. The absence of any benign context, user notification, or validation further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
