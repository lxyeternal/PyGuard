      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a 'main' function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code is executed automatically during package installation, which is strongly associated with malware. The package name 'lanm_neo' and the vague author information provide no indication of legitimacy. The code also declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their usage is not shown here. The key risk indicator is the execution of arbitrary code at install time without user consent or validation, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. This pattern is a critical risk and is almost exclusively observed in malicious Python packages used for supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network exfiltration of encoded system identifiers without consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, indicating potential command-and-control or data collection infrastructure. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including automated data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and use of obfuscation to evade detection."
