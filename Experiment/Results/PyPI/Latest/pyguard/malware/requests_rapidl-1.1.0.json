      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code implements a setuptools installation hook that automatically collects detailed user and system information during the package installation process and sends this data to a hardcoded external server (http://199.189.85.8:5000/collect) without explicit user consent. The collected data includes username, hostname, operating system type and version, private IP address, public IP address, and approximate geolocation. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. Although the code explicitly states it does not collect passwords, the collection and transmission of personally identifiable information (PII) and system details to an attacker-controlled server without user interaction or authorization is a serious privacy violation and is considered malicious. The use of a custom install command to execute this data collection and exfiltration during installation further confirms the intent to perform covert background activity. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package."
