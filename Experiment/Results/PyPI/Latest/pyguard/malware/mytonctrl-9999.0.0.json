      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://0no5igfzh7uwsmzmvvr9eyfy6pcg0eo3.oastify.com) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for exfiltration, combined with automatic execution during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user benefit from this data collection and transmission, and it violates user privacy and security. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
