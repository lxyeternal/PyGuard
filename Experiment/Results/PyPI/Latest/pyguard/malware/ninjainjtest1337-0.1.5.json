      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function get_shell that creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (default 10.0.0.1) on port 4242 and then redirects a shell (/bin/sh) stdin, stdout, and stderr to this socket. This is a classic reverse shell implementation, which allows an attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim machine. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (av9f3cmae8dr818jkwjzemvek5qxen2c.oastify.com) with a timestamp appended, which is indicative of beaconing or data exfiltration. The combination of reverse shell capability and network communication to a suspicious external domain without any user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate business logic or user notification, and the presence of these behaviors aligns with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, backdoor access, and data exfiltration."
