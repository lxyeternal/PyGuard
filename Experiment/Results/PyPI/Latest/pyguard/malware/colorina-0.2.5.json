      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information such as system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from local storage files, saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database, and Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs, which are decoded at runtime to hide their true destination. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate webhook URLs, combined with automated, silent collection and transmission of credentials and system information without user consent or notification, is a classic hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The code also uses subprocess calls to retrieve hardware UUIDs and environment variables to locate sensitive files, further confirming its intent to gather private data. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is designed to stealthily harvest and exfiltrate sensitive credentials and system information to attacker-controlled endpoints, constituting malicious behavior."
