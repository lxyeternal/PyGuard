      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the 'run' method during package installation. Inside this method, it contains an obfuscated string 'l' which is decoded using a ROT13-like cipher to produce a string 'h'. The code then reads the '/etc/passwd' file line by line, parsing each line to find entries where the third field equals '1000' (commonly the user ID of a regular user). For each such user, it attempts to open and then append the decoded string 'h' to the user's '.profile' file located at '/home/{username}/.profile'. This behavior effectively injects hidden code or commands into user shell initialization files without user consent or notification. The injection of obfuscated content into user profile scripts during package installation is a classic supply chain attack technique, enabling execution of malicious payloads whenever the user starts a shell session. The use of obfuscation, file writes to sensitive user configuration files, and execution during the install phase strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to modify user '.profile' files in this manner, and the code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating stealth. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with credential stealing, persistence, or backdoor installation."
