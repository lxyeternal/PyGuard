      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that performs a single HTTP GET request to a canarytokens.com URL during installation. This URL includes the local hostname and username as query parameters. The purpose is to notify the token owner when the package is installed. There is no code execution from remote sources, no obfuscation, no file writing or execution beyond the standard setuptools setup call. The network request is a simple notification and does not exfiltrate sensitive data beyond hostname and username, which are common environment details. The package metadata and setup call are standard and do not perform any harmful actions. This pattern is consistent with a proof-of-concept or tracking token rather than malware. Although the network call during install could be considered suspicious in some contexts, it does not meet the criteria for malicious behavior such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or credential theft."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code automatically collects environment information—specifically the hostname and username of the machine where it runs—without user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (canarytokens.com) immediately upon import. This behavior is consistent with automated, silent data exfiltration and host fingerprinting, which are hallmark indicators of malicious activity. The lack of user notification, combined with the direct transmission of potentially sensitive system identifiers to an external server, aligns with known malware patterns for reconnaissance or credential theft. Although the URL domain is a known canary token service used for intrusion detection, embedding such a call in code that triggers on import without explicit user action is suspicious and typically malicious in nature."
