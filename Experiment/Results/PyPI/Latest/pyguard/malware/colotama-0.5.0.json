      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in a Python package setup script that executes arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, in the _post_install function, it calls pip to install an external package 'pyprettifier' via a shell command, and then executes a file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory, also via a shell command. This behavior is triggered automatically during the installation process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The execution of arbitrary commands during install, especially installing additional packages and running an executable script, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying these actions. The use of subprocess.call with shell=True to run these commands increases risk of command injection or unintended execution. The code also writes exceptions to a temporary file '/tmp/a', which is an unusual location for error logging in benign packages. Overall, this pattern matches known malicious supply chain attack techniques where code execution is hijacked during package installation to run unauthorized or harmful payloads."
