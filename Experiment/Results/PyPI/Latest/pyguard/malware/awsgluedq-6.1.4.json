      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom setuptools install command. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external endpoint is not a known trusted source, and the network communication is done silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such automatic network calls during installation are commonly used for data exfiltration, remote command and control, or to trigger further malicious payloads. The package name and metadata appear generic and do not justify this network activity. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk characteristics consistent with malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq) without any user interaction or legitimate context. The domain and port are suspicious and not associated with known benign services. Such behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it may be used for command-and-control communication, data exfiltration, or remote payload retrieval. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling further supports the classification as malicious. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving contacting attacker-controlled servers silently and automatically."
