      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation strategy class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the install command in setuptools. During installation, it runs the standard install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package name 'importlib_resource' and version '95.6' appear generic but do not match known typosquatting patterns or suspicious names. The install_requires dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil' are common libraries and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. Without the content of the imported main.main() function, it is not possible to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics such as executing code from remote sources during install, obfuscation, or unauthorized data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the provided snippet."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this collected information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated, silent exfiltration of environment and user data to unknown external servers is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive host information without user consent."
