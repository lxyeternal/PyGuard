      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (Anch.exe) from a hardcoded external URL on GitHub (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe) into the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise. The absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or legitimate business logic between download and execution further confirms the malicious intent. Additionally, the use of PowerShell subprocesses to perform these actions aligns with known malware techniques for stealthy execution and evasion."

It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of automated downloading and execution of a remote binary without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands to download and run an executable from an untrusted source, combined with the lack of any integrity checks, user prompts, or logging beyond basic output capture, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as fetching and executing code from a remote URL, silent execution, and writing executables to the current directory without user consent."
