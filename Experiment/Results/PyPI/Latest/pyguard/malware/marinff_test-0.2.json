      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (172.19.132.154) and port (8867). This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during the install process. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, the hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, and the immediate execution of a reverse shell are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such code enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine, bypassing firewalls and monitoring, which is a critical security risk."
