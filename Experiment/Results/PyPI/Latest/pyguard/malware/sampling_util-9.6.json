      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The script constructs HTTP GET requests with these collected data as URL parameters and sends them to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains that do not correspond to any known legitimate services. This behavior is consistent with automated, silent data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses across different operating systems further indicates environment reconnaissance. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and network exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints is a strong hallmark of malicious activity, specifically information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction, logging, or business logic to justify this behavior, and the domains contacted are suspicious and likely attacker-controlled. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent."
