      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command and executes automatically during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The code runs silently during installation, with no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and contacts an external endpoint controlled by an attacker. The use of shell commands to gather environment data combined with immediate network exfiltration during package installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious."
