      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to collect system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address 'http://61.28.229.27', uploading the collected system information file '/tmp/r' without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment discovery (collecting hostname, username, and network configuration) combined with automated exfiltration of this sensitive information to a remote, hardcoded server is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification around this data collection and transmission. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, which appears benign, but the automatic data collection and exfiltration in the constructor is a critical risk and hallmark of malware behavior."
