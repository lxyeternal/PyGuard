      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user information including system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from multiple Discord and browser storage locations, saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database (though encrypted), and Minecraft account credentials from known client configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated automatically and silently to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive files, regex to extract tokens, base64 encoding of encrypted passwords before sending, and the automated network POST requests to an attacker-controlled webhook are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate business logic or user notification and is designed to stealthily harvest and transmit private credentials and system information, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
