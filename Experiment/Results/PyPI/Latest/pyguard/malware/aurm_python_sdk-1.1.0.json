      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior effectively installs a persistent backdoor or remote code execution mechanism that runs arbitrary code fetched from a remote server every time the user opens a shell. The code performs these actions without any user interaction, consent, or validation of the downloaded content. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during package installation, modifying user shell configuration files for persistence, and suppressing errors is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
