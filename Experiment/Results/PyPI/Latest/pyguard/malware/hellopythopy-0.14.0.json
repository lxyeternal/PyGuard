      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) and saves it locally as 'ins42.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file using a shell command without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is triggered as part of the package setup process, specifically via a post-install entry point, which means the malicious payload is executed automatically upon package installation. Such automated downloading and execution of external binaries from untrusted sources during installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The lack of any integrity checks, user notification, or legitimate business logic combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable strongly indicates malicious intent."
