      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it silently exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external IP address for data exfiltration during install time, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and abuse of Python package installation hooks for remote code execution and information theft."
