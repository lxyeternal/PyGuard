      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a large base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload performs multiple suspicious actions: it imports modules like requests, zipfile, and uuid; it constructs hardcoded suspicious constants (e.g., TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID, TELEGRAM_TOKEN) and paths in the temporary directory; it searches for Telegram-related files and user registry keys; it attempts to read and archive these files into a zip archive; it uses threading to perform file operations and then sends the collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint. The code also performs environment discovery, directory creation, file deletion, and uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding, dynamic execution). These behaviors—automated collection of user data, archiving, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot—are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware or information stealer. Furthermore, the execution of this payload is embedded in the package's main code, which means it runs automatically without user consent. This combination of obfuscation, data collection, and exfiltration confirms the code is malicious."
