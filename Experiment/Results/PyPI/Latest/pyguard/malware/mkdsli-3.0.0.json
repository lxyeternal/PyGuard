      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com), which is likely attacker-controlled. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the automatic network communication during install, strongly indicates malicious intent."
