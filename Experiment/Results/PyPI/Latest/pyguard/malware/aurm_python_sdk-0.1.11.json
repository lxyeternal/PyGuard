      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables automatic execution of potentially untrusted remote code every time the user opens a shell, without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors and does not validate or sanitize the downloaded content, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The combination of network retrieval of code during package installation, writing to hidden user files, and persistence via shell profile modification is a strong indicator of malicious intent and remote code execution capability. Such behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate packages and poses a high security risk."
