      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfsf6q8vh2wj3o8.oast.fun), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently collect and exfiltrate system information. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of a suspicious external URL and automatic data exfiltration during install, strongly indicates malicious intent."
