      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (https://hhxy01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/PFAI.sh) without any user interaction or validation, then changes its permissions to executable and runs it immediately. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code without user consent or integrity checks is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, which is a common vector for malware delivery, remote code execution, and system compromise. The absence of any benign context, user notification, or validation, combined with direct execution of a downloaded script, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware."
