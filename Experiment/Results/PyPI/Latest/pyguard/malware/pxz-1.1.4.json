      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the public IP address, hostname, home directory, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard private IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php), which is indicative of data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. This data collection and exfiltration occurs immediately upon execution, including during package installation (as the code runs at import time before the setup() call). Such behavior is a hallmark of malicious activity, specifically supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware. The use of os.popen to run a shell command to get the public IP, combined with network transmission of collected environment data without user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent."
