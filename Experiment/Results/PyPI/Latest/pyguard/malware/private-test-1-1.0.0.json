      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic, combined with the automatic network communication to an attacker-controlled server during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent."
