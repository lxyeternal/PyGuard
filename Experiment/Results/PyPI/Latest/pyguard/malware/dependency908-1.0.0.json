      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://gj8fxybp.requestrepo.com). This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. Such automated collection and exfiltration of system and user information to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user notification further confirm the malicious intent."
