      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them as JSON data to a hardcoded Google Chat webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information, which may include credentials, tokens, or other secrets. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for sending this data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables an attacker-controlled server to receive sensitive system information covertly. Additionally, the subprocess call to 'printenv' duplicates environment variable collection and also sends the output to the same external endpoint, reinforcing the data exfiltration pattern. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior in typical benign software. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
