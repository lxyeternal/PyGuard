      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, aligns with known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
