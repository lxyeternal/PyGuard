      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the local machine and sends it as a query parameter to a remote URL that is obfuscated via base64 encoding. The URL decodes to a suspicious domain (likely attacker-controlled) and the code makes an HTTPS request to this external server without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is consistent with automated host fingerprinting and data exfiltration, which are common in malware for reconnaissance or tracking infected hosts. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the silent network communication without validation or user notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Although the code only prints the response content, the initial data collection and transmission to a suspicious external endpoint is a hallmark of malware behavior."
