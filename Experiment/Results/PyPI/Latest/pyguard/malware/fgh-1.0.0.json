      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user input in the form of 12 seed phrases, which are typically used as secret recovery phrases for cryptocurrency wallets or other secure accounts. It then sends these secret words via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating sensitive credentials to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of confidential information without user consent or legitimate purpose, which is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The presence of hardcoded bot token and chat ID, combined with the automated network transmission of sensitive secrets, strongly indicates malicious intent."
