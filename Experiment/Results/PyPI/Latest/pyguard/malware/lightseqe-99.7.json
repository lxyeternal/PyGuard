      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation strategy for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. However, the code itself does not contain any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically retrieved or encoded code. The package name 'lightseqe' is slightly unusual but not clearly a typosquat or suspicious. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered after installation, but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics such as executing arbitrary code during install without user consent, downloading or executing remote payloads, or exfiltrating data. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the given information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. The URLs use unusual domain names and subdomains that are not associated with legitimate services. The data is sent automatically at runtime, indicating automated data exfiltration. This pattern of environment discovery combined with silent network communication to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code does not perform any benign operations such as updates or telemetry to trusted servers. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious due to automated, unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system and user identity information to attacker-controlled servers."
