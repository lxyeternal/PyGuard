      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'CBLines.exe' from a hardcoded external URL on GitHub (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly into the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise. The absence of any integrity checks, digital signature verification, or user prompts, combined with the direct execution of a potentially untrusted binary, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as automated file download and execution, lack of user consent, use of PowerShell for stealth execution, and execution of remote code, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
