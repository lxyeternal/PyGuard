      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes silent, automated data exfiltration of sensitive system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather environment data combined with immediate network transmission during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. The hardcoded external webhook URL and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user interaction further confirm the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration triggered automatically on install."
