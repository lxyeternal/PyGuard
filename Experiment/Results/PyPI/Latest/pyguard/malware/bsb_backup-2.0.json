      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation, including base64 decoding, marshal deserialization, zlib decompression, and hex decoding, each followed by immediate execution via exec(). This multi-layered obfuscation is a classic malware technique to evade static analysis and hide the true payload. The decoded payload is a setuptools setup script that installs a package named 'bsb-backup' described as a persistent backup tool that sends photos, videos, SMS, and contacts to Telegram in real-time. This description suggests unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of sensitive user data without consent. The presence of obfuscated code executed during package installation (setup) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The code lacks any user interaction or notification and performs automated background activity. The repeated comments in Bengali warning against decoding also indicate an attempt to deter analysis. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily install a persistent data exfiltration tool that sends private user data to an external entity, which is a clear malicious behavior."
