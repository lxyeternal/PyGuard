      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including multiple layers of base64 decoding and lzma decompression, to conceal its true payload. The code executes decrypted and decompressed data dynamically using exec(), which is a hallmark of malware attempting to hide its actions. It performs environment checks to detect debugging or sandbox environments and checks for suspicious processes, indicating anti-analysis techniques. The code is embedded in a setuptools install hook, meaning it executes automatically during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. It uses cryptographic functions to decrypt payloads, further hiding its intent. The obfuscated payload is executed only on Windows systems, and the code forcibly exits if conditions are met, preventing normal operation. The install_requires list includes many standard and some suspicious packages, but the main concern is the execution of hidden code during installation. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during installation, which is a critical malicious behavior."
