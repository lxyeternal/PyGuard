      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell client that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (34.30.170.63) on port 3000. It receives commands from the remote server, executes them on the local system using subprocess.check_output with shell=True, and sends back the command output. This behavior enables an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, continuous command reception and execution loop, and direct execution of received commands are classic hallmarks of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. Such code is malicious as it compromises system security, allows unauthorized control, and can be used for data exfiltration, system manipulation, or further attacks."
