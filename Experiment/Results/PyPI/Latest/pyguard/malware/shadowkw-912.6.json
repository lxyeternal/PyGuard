      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code snippet itself does not show any suspicious or malicious behavior such as obfuscated code, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of arbitrary or remote code. The package name 'shadowkw' and versioning do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The install_requires includes only 'requests', a common library, and no suspicious imports or operations are present. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered after installation, but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics such as executing shell commands, downloading or executing remote payloads, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the provided information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The use of randomized query parameters and the transmission of user and system identifiers to unknown external endpoints is a classic pattern of data exfiltration and system fingerprinting commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission, indicating covert behavior. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further supporting the conclusion that this code is designed for malicious data exfiltration purposes."
