      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information including system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from local storage files, saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database, and Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All these data are then exfiltrated by sending HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs, which are decoded at runtime to hide the true endpoints. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate webhook URLs, automated silent collection of credentials without user consent, and immediate network transmission to attacker-controlled endpoints are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. The code performs no legitimate user interaction or notification and bundles data collection and exfiltration in a single automated flow. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as information stealing, data exfiltration, and privacy violation. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
