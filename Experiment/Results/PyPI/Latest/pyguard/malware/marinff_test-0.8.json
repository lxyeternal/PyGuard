      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute malicious actions during package installation. It contains an obfuscated payload represented as a list of integers, which is decoded by subtracting 30 from each integer and converting to characters, resulting in a Python script written to '/tmp/xxx.py'. Immediately after writing this file, the code constructs a base64-encoded shell command to run this script with 'python3 /tmp/xxx.py' and executes it via a shell command. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution of the decoded script strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to establish a reverse shell or execute unauthorized commands on the victim system. The package metadata and author name ('badman') further suggest malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of arbitrary code during install, writing to temporary directories, and spawning shell commands with base64 decoding. Therefore, this code is malicious."
