      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the user's system. The package name is suspiciously random and anonymous, and the install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering. Executing code at install time without explicit user consent or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to run payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system stealthily. Therefore, this pattern matches the critical risk indicator of executing arbitrary code during package installation, a known malware vector."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user identity information without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the targeting of non-standard, suspicious domains, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs automatically when executed. These factors align with known malware patterns for environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
