      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the setuptools install command. During the installation process, it makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/). This network call is made silently without any user interaction or notification, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to exfiltrate environment or system information or to signal the attacker-controlled server. Although the commented-out code suggests an intention to collect hostname, current working directory, and username, even the simple GET request to a non-standard, suspicious domain during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known vector for remote code execution and data exfiltration in malicious Python packages. The package name 'chain00x' and the URL domain are not recognized as legitimate or trusted sources. Therefore, this code exhibits characteristics consistent with supply chain attacks and automated data exfiltration, classifying it as malicious."
