      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it silently exfiltrates system and user information during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external IP for data exfiltration during install time, combined with the lack of legitimate business logic or user notification, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and abuse of Python package installation hooks."
