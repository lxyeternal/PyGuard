      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes this network communication silently during the install phase, without any user interaction or legitimate business logic, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the automatic execution during installation, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized environment data collection and exfiltration, abuse of setuptools install hooks for remote code execution, and lack of transparency or user consent."
