      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell client that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (34.30.170.63) on port 3000. It receives commands from the remote server, executes them on the local system using subprocess.check_output with shell=True, and sends back the command output. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, continuous network communication to receive and execute arbitrary commands, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
