      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and, upon installation, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (a non-standard, attacker-controlled-looking URL). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or legitimate purpose. Such automated data exfiltration during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The absence of any user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic combined with the use of a suspicious external endpoint strongly indicates malicious intent."
