      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class that automatically collects detailed system information including hostname, platform details, local IP addresses, and domain names without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for data exfiltration testing or malicious data collection. The automatic execution of data collection and exfiltration upon class instantiation, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving silent system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. There is no obfuscation or dynamic code execution here, but the direct and automated collection and transmission of sensitive system information to a suspicious external endpoint is a hallmark of malicious activity."
