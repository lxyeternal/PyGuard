      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ovnabqa0k6gt0vwzch7ovggkabg74xsm.oastify.com). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded external URL is attacker-controlled infrastructure used for data collection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data exfiltration. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong and exclusive indicator of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack that collects and exfiltrates sensitive environment data during package installation."
