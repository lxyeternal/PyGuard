      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that automatically execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development installation. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app'). This behavior constitutes silent and automatic exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a ngrok domain (commonly used for tunneling and often attacker-controlled) as the destination further indicates malicious intent. Executing such data exfiltration during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly stealing environment information from the victim system during package installation."
