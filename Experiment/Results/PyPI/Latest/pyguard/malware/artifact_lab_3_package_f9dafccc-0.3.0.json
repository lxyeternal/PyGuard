It then sends this sensitive token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials. Moreover, this token exfiltration is triggered automatically during the package installation process (in the setup script), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, automatic credential harvesting, and exfiltration during install time without user notification or legitimate purpose are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an authentication token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service at the well-known internal IP address 169.254.169.254, which is a sensitive credential used for accessing Google Cloud resources. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive credentials, which is a hallmark of malicious activity such as credential theft or information stealing malware. The code runs this exfiltration automatically upon execution, with no legitimate business logic or user-driven action, and targets an attacker-controlled domain. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
