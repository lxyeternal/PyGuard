      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches for folders named 'Telegram Desktop' on multiple drives and copies most files from these folders (excluding certain directories and files) into a temporary directory. It then compresses this copied data into a ZIP archive and silently uploads it via HTTP POST to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN) without any user interaction or notification. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop application. The use of hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, exclusion of legitimate Telegram executables while copying user data files, and silent network transmission strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with credential or data stealing malware."

It compresses these files into a ZIP archive and silently uploads the archive via HTTP POST to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated collection and exfiltration of user data from a messaging application, which is a hallmark of malicious activity, specifically data theft or credential stealing malware. The code uses no obfuscation but performs stealthy file copying, compression, and network exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the hardcoded external IP and path strongly indicate malicious intent."
