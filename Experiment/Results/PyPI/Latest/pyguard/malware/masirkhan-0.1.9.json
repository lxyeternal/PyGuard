      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it silently exfiltrates system and user information during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external IP address for data exfiltration, combined with automatic execution during install, matches multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including environment reconnaissance and unauthorized data leakage. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, making this code malicious."
