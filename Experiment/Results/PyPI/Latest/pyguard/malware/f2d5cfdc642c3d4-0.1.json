      "malicious_behavior": "The code hooks into the setuptools installation process by subclassing the install command and overriding its run method to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it collects the current username and runs the 'id' shell command to gather system identity information. It then enumerates the directory tree of '/etc/', concatenates this information, encodes it in base64, and attempts to send it via a function named send_put_request. Although send_put_request is stubbed to raise an exception here, the intended behavior is clearly to exfiltrate sensitive system information during installation without user consent or notification. This pattern of environment discovery, data encoding, and network transmission during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data, the automatic execution during install, and the collection of sensitive system and user information strongly indicate malicious intent."
