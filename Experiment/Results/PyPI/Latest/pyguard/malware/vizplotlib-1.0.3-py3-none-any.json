      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and decompression to hide its true functionality. Specifically, it defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64', then decodes a base64-encoded string, reverses it, decompresses it using zlib, and immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation combined with direct execution of dynamically decoded code is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Such techniques are commonly used to evade static detection and analysis by hiding the payload. The absence of any user interaction, the use of exec on decompressed data, and the obfuscation strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
