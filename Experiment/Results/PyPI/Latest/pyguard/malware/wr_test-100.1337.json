      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that performs a network request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-<hostname>). This behavior is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code or data can be fetched and potentially executed on the user's system during package installation without user consent or validation. The collection of the hostname and its immediate use in constructing the URL for the curl command indicates environment reconnaissance and possible data exfiltration or targeted payload delivery. The absence of any validation, user interaction, or legitimate business logic before this network call and shell execution further confirms malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information by retrieving the hostname via os.uname()[1] and lists the current directory contents. It then constructs a string combining the hostname and directory listing, replacing spaces with '0'. This data is sent via an HTTP GET request using curl to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://jacobsandum.com:8000/). This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of host information without user knowledge or consent. The use of os.system to invoke curl for network communication to an attacker-controlled server, combined with no legitimate user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also defines a function run() that repeats this exfiltration, suggesting automated or repeated data leakage. There is no benign justification for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, data encoding, and automated data exfiltration to a suspicious external server."

This behavior is indicative of contacting an attacker-controlled server without user interaction or consent. The use of a direct shell command to perform network communication to a non-standard port and domain, without any legitimate context or validation, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are commonly observed in malware for data exfiltration, remote code retrieval, or command-and-control communication. The absence of any benign context, user notification, or legitimate business logic further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
