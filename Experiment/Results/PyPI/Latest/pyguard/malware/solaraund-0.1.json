      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, non-official GitHub URL and saves it to the current working directory without user consent or validation. After confirming the file exists, it immediately launches the downloaded executable using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The absence of any user interaction, integrity checks, or legitimate business logic, combined with the automatic download and execution of an untrusted binary, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a high-risk indicator of compromise."
