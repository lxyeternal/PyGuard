      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to non-standard, suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are not recognized as trusted or benign. The use of randomized query parameters further suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. Overall, this automated, covert data exfiltration aligns with known malware techniques for reconnaissance and credential theft."
