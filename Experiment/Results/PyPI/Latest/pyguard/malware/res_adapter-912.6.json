      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically retrieved or encoded code. The package metadata and dependencies appear generic and do not indicate suspicious behavior. Without the content of the imported main module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered at install time, but based solely on this code, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple external endpoints further suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure data delivery. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains are not associated with known trusted services. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated, non-interactive data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious domains is a hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
