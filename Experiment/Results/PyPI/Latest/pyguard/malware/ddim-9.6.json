      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear attacker-controlled and are not associated with any legitimate service. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user-specific data and sending it to suspicious domains, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further confirming the malicious nature of the code."
