      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it collects the current user's login name and the system's hostname, concatenates them, encodes this information in base64, and then uses it as part of a DNS lookup command to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (ending with .oast.live). This behavior is a classic example of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data, the execution of a shell command in the install hook, and the silent suppression of command output further indicate malicious intent. Such code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate user and system information to an external server during installation, which is a strong indicator of malware."
