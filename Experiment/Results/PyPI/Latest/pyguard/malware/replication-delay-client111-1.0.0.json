      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (c61vv1m2vtc00009mdj0gdy77oayyyyyb.interactsh.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain for data exfiltration combined with automatic execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent."
