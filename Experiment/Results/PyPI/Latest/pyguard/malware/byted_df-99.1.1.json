      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information (hostname and package name) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL that is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The URL decodes to a suspicious domain (likely attacker-controlled) and the code uses an unverified SSL context to bypass certificate validation, which is a common evasion technique. This pattern of obfuscating the remote endpoint, collecting environment data without user consent, and sending it automatically to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with data exfiltration or system fingerprinting malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code performs network communication immediately upon execution, which aligns with typical malware characteristics."
