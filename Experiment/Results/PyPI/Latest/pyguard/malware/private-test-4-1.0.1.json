      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it runs a shell command ('ls') to list directory contents, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this collected data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the collection and silent transmission of system information to an external, hardcoded IP address, strongly indicates malicious intent."
