      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains consistent with known malicious infrastructure (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The data exfiltration is automated and performed silently without user interaction or notification. This pattern of environment discovery combined with automated data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this network activity. The absence of error handling beyond logging and the use of randomized query parameters further suggest attempts to evade detection. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
