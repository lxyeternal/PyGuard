      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports a function m from a module named main and executes it immediately without any user interaction or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware because it enables execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized code on the user's system at install time. The package name and metadata appear generic and do not provide any legitimate context for executing code during installation. The absence of any validation, user notification, or sandboxing further increases the risk. This technique is commonly used by attackers to deliver payloads, perform environment reconnaissance, or install backdoors silently. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 to obfuscate the data. It then constructs HTTP GET requests to three hardcoded, base64-encoded URLs that decode to suspicious, non-standard domains not associated with legitimate services. The collected system information is sent silently and automatically to these external servers without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses via system commands (getmac on Windows, ifconfig on Linux/macOS) combined with base64 encoding and network exfiltration is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The obfuscation of URLs and data encoding further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code runs automatically when executed. These behaviors align strongly with malicious data exfiltration and host fingerprinting malware patterns."
