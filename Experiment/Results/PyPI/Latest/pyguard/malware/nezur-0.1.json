      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) into the current working directory without user consent or validation. After downloading, it immediately executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The lack of user interaction, absence of integrity checks, and execution of a potentially untrusted binary from a remote source strongly indicate malicious intent. Such automated download and execution of external executables during install time is a high-risk behavior exclusively observed in malware samples."
