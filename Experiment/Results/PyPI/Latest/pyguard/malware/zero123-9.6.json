      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it runs the original install method and then immediately imports and executes a function named main() from a module named main. This means that arbitrary code in main.main() will be executed automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems, where malicious code is executed during package installation to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions. The package name 'zero123' and author information are generic and anonymous, which is suspicious. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key risk indicator is the execution of arbitrary code at install time via setuptools install hook, which is strongly associated with malicious behavior and supply chain attacks. There is no indication of user notification, validation, or sandboxing before executing main.main(), which increases the risk. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior by enabling automatic execution of potentially harmful code during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Then, it sends this collected and encoded information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to known legitimate services. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are indicative of attacker-controlled or testing infrastructure often used for exfiltration or command-and-control. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network exfiltration of encoded system identifiers without consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting."
