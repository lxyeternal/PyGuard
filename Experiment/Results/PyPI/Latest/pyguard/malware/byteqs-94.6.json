      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, enabling potential execution of malicious payloads on the user's system. The code does not show the content of the 'main' function, but the pattern of executing code automatically at install time is strongly associated with malicious activity, especially since it bypasses normal user consent and can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code. Additionally, the package name 'byteqs' and the author information are minimal and suspicious, which can be indicative of a typosquatted or malicious package. The use of install_requires for common libraries like 'requests' and 'psutil' could be to facilitate network communication or system information gathering in the 'main' function, which is a common tactic in malware. Overall, the automatic execution of code during installation without user consent or transparency is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network communication to suspicious endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration."
