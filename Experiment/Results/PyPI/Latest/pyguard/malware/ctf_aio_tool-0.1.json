      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. It contains an obfuscated payload represented as a list of integers, which is decoded by subtracting 30 from each integer and converting to characters, reconstructing a Python script. This script is then written to a temporary file '/tmp/11293.py'. Immediately after, the code constructs a shell command to run this script using 'python3 /tmp/11293.py', encodes this command in base64, and executes it via a shell pipeline that decodes and runs the command. This pattern of obfuscation, writing to a temporary file, and executing a reverse shell or arbitrary code during installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code executes without user interaction or consent, hides the payload via obfuscation, and runs it in a non-transparent manner during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
