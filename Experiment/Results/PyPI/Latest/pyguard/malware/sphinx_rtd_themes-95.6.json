      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and sending it to suspicious endpoints, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the domains contacted are not standard or trusted services. Therefore, this code is performing automated, covert data collection and exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious software."
