      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials), extracting sensitive information such as 'aws_access_key_id' and 'aws_secret_access_key' from all sections. It then serializes this sensitive data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://eo64g38fdes1lxm.m.pipedream.net) without any user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The presence of a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL combined with automated collection and transmission of sensitive credentials strongly indicates malicious intent."
