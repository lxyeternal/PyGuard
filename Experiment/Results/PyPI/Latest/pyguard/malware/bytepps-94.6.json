      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network exfiltration of encoded system identifiers without consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are not standard or reputable endpoints, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to suspicious external servers."
