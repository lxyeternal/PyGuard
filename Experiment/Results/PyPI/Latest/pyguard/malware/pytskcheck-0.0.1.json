It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or legitimate business logic, combined with the direct coupling of network retrieval and execution, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for malware propagation, payload deployment, or system compromise."

It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise. The absence of any integrity checks, digital signature verification, or user prompts, combined with the silent execution of a potentially untrusted executable, strongly indicates malicious intent. This matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated file download and execution, use of PowerShell subprocesses for stealth execution, and lack of user consent or notification."
