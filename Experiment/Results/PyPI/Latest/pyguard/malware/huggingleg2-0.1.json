      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it checks if the environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True', and if so, it runs a bash reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded IP address (120.55.57.148) on port 8080. This behavior is a classic indicator of a reverse shell backdoor, allowing an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine. Executing such a command during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and unauthorized access. The presence of this hardcoded external IP, the use of os.system to spawn an interactive shell redirected over a network socket, and the lack of any legitimate purpose or user notification confirm that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that opens an interactive bash shell and redirects its input and output over a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address (120.55.57.148) on port 8080. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, which allows an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim machine. The command uses /bin/bash with redirection to /dev/tcp, which is a known technique for establishing reverse shells. There is no user interaction or consent, no legitimate business logic, and the hardcoded IP address is suspicious. This behavior is a definitive indicator of malicious intent, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control of the system."
