This data collection and exfiltration is triggered automatically during the package installation process via the on_install function linked in the setup entry_points, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: automated data exfiltration of system and user environment information, execution of network communication during package installation, use of a hardcoded suspicious server URL, and lack of user notification or legitimate business logic. Such patterns are strongly associated with malicious activity, specifically credential or environment data theft and supply chain compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
