      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command hook. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external server is contacted automatically, which may be used for data exfiltration, remote command and control, or tracking. The use of a custom setuptools install command to run network communication during installation is a known malicious technique to execute code stealthily on user systems. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with these network calls, and the domain is not a known trusted endpoint. This combination of automatic network communication during install, use of a suspicious external URL, and hooking into the setuptools install process strongly indicates malicious intent."
