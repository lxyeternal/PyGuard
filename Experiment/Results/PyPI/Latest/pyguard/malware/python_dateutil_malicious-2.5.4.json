      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands ('whoami' and 'ip addr') immediately during package installation without any user interaction or consent. It collects sensitive system information (current user and network interfaces) and silently sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled external URL (a Burp Collaborator domain). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration and reconnaissance performed during a supply chain attack. The execution of this payload in the setup script means it runs automatically when the package is installed, which is a known vector for malicious code execution in Python ecosystems. The package name 'python-dateutil-malicious' and the description explicitly mention malicious intent and dependency confusion, further confirming the malicious nature. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. All these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior."
