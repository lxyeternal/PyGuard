      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code executes during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external server is contacted automatically, which may be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or remote command and control. The use of a custom setuptools install command to run network communication during installation is a known malicious technique to execute code or exfiltrate data stealthily. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is not a known trusted endpoint. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain and port ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml') without any user interaction or context. The domain and port combination is unusual and not associated with known legitimate services. This pattern of contacting a hardcoded, attacker-controlled external server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it may be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or staging further payloads. The absence of any legitimate context, user notification, or validation, combined with the direct network communication to a suspicious endpoint, aligns with known malware behaviors involving remote communication to attacker infrastructure."
