      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that performs a network request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-<hostname>). This behavior is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code or data can be fetched and potentially executed on the victim's system during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of os.uname()[1] to collect the hostname and immediately send it to an external server without validation or notification is consistent with malicious environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The direct invocation of os.system with a curl command to an attacker-controlled domain during setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and payload delivery in a trusted installation workflow. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this network call or shell execution in a setup script, confirming the code's malicious nature."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information by retrieving the hostname and the list of files/directories in the current working directory, then concatenates and encodes this data into a string. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (http://jacobsandum.com:8000/). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of host environment data without user consent or notification. The use of os.system to invoke curl for network communication, combined with the lack of any legitimate user interaction or business logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such data exfiltration patterns are hallmark behaviors of malware used for reconnaissance or staging further attacks."

It then constructs a string combining the hostname and directory listing, replacing spaces with '0'. This data is sent via an HTTP GET request using curl to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://jacobsandum.com:8000/). This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of host information without user consent or notification. The use of os.system to invoke curl for data exfiltration, combined with the hardcoded attacker-controlled URL, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this network communication. The code also defines a function run() that repeats the exfiltration, indicating potential for repeated or automated data leakage. These factors align with known malware patterns of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command using os.system to run 'curl' to fetch data from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/adfslogin). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs an automatic network request to a non-standard, potentially attacker-controlled domain and port without any user interaction or validation. The use of os.system to invoke curl directly to contact an external server is a common technique in malware for data exfiltration, remote code retrieval, or command-and-control communication. There is no legitimate context or benign justification for this pattern, and it aligns with known malicious behaviors such as automated network communication to suspicious endpoints and execution of shell commands for potentially harmful purposes."

The code also defines a function that repeats this exfiltration, suggesting automated or repeated data leakage. The hardcoded external domain, lack of obfuscation but direct data exfiltration, and absence of any benign context or user notification align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically data exfiltration and host fingerprinting."
