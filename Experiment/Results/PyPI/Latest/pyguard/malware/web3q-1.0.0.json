      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class with an obfuscated name that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation strongly indicate an attempt to run hidden malicious code on the target system. The package metadata also contains meaningless or random strings, which is typical of malware trying to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary code fetched from the encrypted blob, which could perform any malicious action. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
