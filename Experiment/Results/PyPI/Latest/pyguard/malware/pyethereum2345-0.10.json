      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation. It collects system information such as the hostname and username without user consent. It then executes a shell command via subprocess to run a curl command that downloads a ZIP file from a suspicious external URL (hosted on gitlab.com but in a user repository with a suspicious path) and saves it to a hardcoded path under /home/kali/dependencyconfusion/dependency-confusion-expoit/python-rce/test.zip. This is an unusual and suspicious action during package installation. After that, it sends the collected system information (hostname, username, and the output of the curl command, which is likely empty or error text) to a hardcoded external URL (https://eojs8k35b24avi1.m.pipedream.net), which is a known service used for capturing webhooks and can be used by attackers to exfiltrate data. The combination of gathering environment info, downloading a file from an untrusted source during install, and exfiltrating data to an external endpoint without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to gather information and stage further payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
