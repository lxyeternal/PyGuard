This network activity is triggered before any legitimate package setup logic, indicating potential background communication with a possibly attacker-controlled local server or proxy. Additionally, the package is named 'evil-pkg1' and the package directory is 'evil_pkg1', which are suspicious and indicative of malicious intent or a test for malicious behavior. The combination of automatic network communication during package import and the suspicious naming strongly suggests malicious behavior, as it may be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or triggering further malicious payloads. Although the setup() call itself appears benign, the unsolicited network request at import time is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks that execute code during package installation or import."
