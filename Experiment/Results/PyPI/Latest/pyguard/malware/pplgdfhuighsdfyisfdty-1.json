      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/405422660992@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com/token) without user consent or interaction, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c3913969-ff17-4757-a267-069d41c248a7). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of installation hooks to run arbitrary shell commands that collect and transmit sensitive tokens to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the package name is suspicious and random, further supporting the conclusion that this code is malicious."
