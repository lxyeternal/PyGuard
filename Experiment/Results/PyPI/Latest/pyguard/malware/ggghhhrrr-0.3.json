      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP POST request automatically to a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard domain (uxvl816vmalocgh96k6mr8vg97fy3ord.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. The domain name appears random and attacker-controlled, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The function notify() sends a message indicating that a package was imported, which could be used by an attacker to track usage or presence of the package on victim systems. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns of automated network communication to suspicious endpoints for data exfiltration or remote monitoring. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code silently attempts to communicate with an external server, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
