      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command hook. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of a custom setuptools install command to run network communication during installation is a known vector for malicious payload delivery or system reconnaissance. The hardcoded external URL is not a known trusted endpoint and the code does not perform any legitimate business logic or user notification before contacting this server. This automatic network communication during installation, combined with the override of the install command, strongly suggests malicious intent consistent with remote code execution or data exfiltration attempts in supply chain attacks."
