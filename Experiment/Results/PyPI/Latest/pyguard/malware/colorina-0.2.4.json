      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information including system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from local storage files, saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database, and Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs, which are decoded at runtime to hide their true destination. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate webhook URLs, automated silent data collection without user consent or notification, and immediate network transmission of sensitive credentials are hallmark traits of credential-stealing malware. The code also uses subprocess calls to retrieve hardware UUID and environment variables to locate sensitive files, further confirming its intent to gather private data. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is designed to stealthily harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user credentials and system information to attacker-controlled endpoints, classifying it as malicious."
