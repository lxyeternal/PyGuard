      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious local URL 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/evil' immediately upon import, without any user interaction or notification. This network activity is automatic and targets a suspicious endpoint named 'evil', which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Furthermore, the code defines a setuptools setup() call for a package named 'evil-pkg2' with a misleading description 'Just a harmless package :)', which suggests an attempt to disguise malicious behavior within a package installation process. The combination of automatic network communication to a suspicious endpoint and the use of a setup script with a suspicious package name aligns with known supply chain attack patterns where code execution and data exfiltration occur during package installation. Although the code does not explicitly show payload execution or data exfiltration beyond the GET request, the immediate network call to a suspicious endpoint during module import and the deceptive package naming strongly indicate malicious behavior."
