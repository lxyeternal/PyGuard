      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this collected and encoded information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network transmission of encoded system identifiers to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
