      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically retrieved or encoded code. The package name \"machaque\" and author information are generic but not inherently suspicious. The install_requires includes 'requests', a common library, but no direct network calls are made in this snippet. Without the content of the main module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively assess the full behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics such as executing code from untrusted sources during install, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the provided information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or system fingerprinting malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation, combined with the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
