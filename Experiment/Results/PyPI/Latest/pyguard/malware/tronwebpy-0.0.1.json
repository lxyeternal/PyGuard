      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects a private key (likely sensitive credential) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain strongly suggests attacker-controlled infrastructure. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another suspicious endpoint (https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/switcher) to possibly control or verify the exfiltration process. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the function name and variable naming do not indicate benign usage. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, specifically automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive credentials to an attacker-controlled server."
