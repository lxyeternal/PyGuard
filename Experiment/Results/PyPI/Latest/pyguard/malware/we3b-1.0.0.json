      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during package installation strongly suggest a supply chain attack vector. The package name and metadata are nonsensical and likely intended to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks beyond running this hidden payload. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code during installation, and lack of user notification or consent."
