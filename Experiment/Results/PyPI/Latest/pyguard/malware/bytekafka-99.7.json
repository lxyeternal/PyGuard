      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains consistent with known malicious infrastructure (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are commonly used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration in malware. The code performs this data exfiltration automatically on execution, without any legitimate business logic or user notification. This pattern of environment discovery combined with automated, silent data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential or environment information stealing malware. There is no benign justification for sending such sensitive host and user information to these suspicious endpoints, and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent further confirms the malicious intent."
