      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code implements a setuptools installation hook that automatically collects detailed user and system information during the package installation process and sends it to a hardcoded remote server (IP 38.181.219.70 on port 5000) without explicit user consent. The collected data includes username, hostname, OS type and version, private IP, public IP, and approximate geolocation. This data collection and exfiltration occurs silently during installation, leveraging a custom install command that runs automatically, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Although the code explicitly states it does not collect passwords, the gathering and transmission of personally identifiable information (PII) and system details to an external server without user interaction or authorization is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of threading to send data asynchronously during install further indicates an attempt to evade detection or delay. The hardcoded external server and automatic data exfiltration during package installation classify this as a malicious backdoor or information-stealing behavior embedded in a Python package installation process."
