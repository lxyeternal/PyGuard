      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in a Python package setup. During installation, it constructs an obfuscated URL (decoded from a list of ASCII codes) pointing to a raw GitHubusercontent URL hosting a shell script named 'setup_moneroocean_miner.sh'. It then attempts to run subprocess commands that execute 'bash --version' (likely as a check) and then runs a shell command that downloads the script from the remote URL using 'curl' and pipes it directly to 'bash' with a long, obfuscated argument string. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation of command strings and the direct download and execution of a remote script from a suspicious URL are strong indicators of malicious intent. The script name and repository suggest it is related to Monero cryptocurrency mining, which is commonly associated with unauthorized cryptomining malware. The code suppresses output and errors to avoid detection. This automatic execution of remote code during installation is a high-risk behavior consistent with malware, specifically a cryptominer payload delivered via a Python package installation hook."
