      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system by converting os.environ to a string, then encodes this sensitive environment data using base64 encoding. It then sends this encoded environment information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious, attacker-controlled external domain (\"http://csngft88cumgfr3deiig43by9rko6sn7o.oast.fun\") without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, where sensitive system information is stealthily collected and transmitted to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of base64 encoding serves as a simple obfuscation technique to evade detection by security tools. There is no legitimate business logic or user-driven action justifying this data collection and transmission. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct environment variable collection combined with automated network exfiltration to suspicious domains is a strong and exclusive indicator of malicious intent."
