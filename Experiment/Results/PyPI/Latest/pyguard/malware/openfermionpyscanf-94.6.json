      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious behavior. The package name and metadata are generic but not obviously typosquatted or suspicious. The install_requires includes common libraries (requests, psutil) which are not inherently malicious. Without the content of the main module and its main() function, no direct malicious behavior can be confirmed. Based on the code shown and the knowledge points, this code does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and sending it to unknown external servers, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely malicious. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident in the code. The subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses are used solely for environment reconnaissance. This automated, non-interactive collection and exfiltration of sensitive host information strongly indicates malicious intent."
