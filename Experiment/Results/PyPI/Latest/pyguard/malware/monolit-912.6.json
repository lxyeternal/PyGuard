It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscated code, network communication, file system manipulation, dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), or any other suspicious behavior. The package name 'monolit' and versioning do not appear suspicious or typosquatted. The code does not perform any unauthorized actions during installation beyond invoking a local function. Without additional context or the content of the 'main' module, this code alone does not exhibit malicious characteristics based on the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The use of randomized query parameters and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user notification strongly indicate automated data exfiltration. This pattern of environment discovery combined with silent network transmission to suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information-stealing malware. There is no benign justification for silently sending such sensitive system information to unknown external servers."
