      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PreferredSettings) that, during the package installation process, silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior effectively establishes persistence by ensuring the downloaded script runs automatically in future shell sessions without user consent or notification. The downloaded script's content is not validated or sandboxed, allowing arbitrary code execution controlled by the remote server. Executing remote code during package installation without user interaction or verification is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of silent try/except blocks suppresses errors and evades detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including remote code retrieval and execution during installation, persistence via shell profile modification, and lack of user consent or transparency."
