      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system by converting os.environ to a string, then encodes this sensitive information using base64 encoding. It then sends this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external domain (http://sbtnpwggzhrjftpytfsuvcogqgwv8uu5r.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive environment information (which may include credentials, tokens, or system configuration) is stealthily transmitted to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding here serves as obfuscation to evade simple detection mechanisms. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this operation. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct environment data collection combined with network exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong and exclusive indicator of malicious activity."
