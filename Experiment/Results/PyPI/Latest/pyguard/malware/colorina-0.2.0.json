      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded URLs that decode to suspicious webhook endpoints (likely attacker-controlled) to which it exfiltrates sensitive user data without any user consent or notification. The data collected includes system information (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from various local storage paths, saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database, and Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. The presence of multiple hardcoded webhook URLs and the automated sending of collected sensitive data to these endpoints is a classic data exfiltration pattern. The code also uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true nature of the URLs, which is a common evasion technique. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior. The combination of environment discovery, credential theft, and automated network exfiltration to attacker-controlled webhooks strongly classifies this code as malicious, specifically as an information stealer or credential stealer malware."
