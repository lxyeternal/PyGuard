      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication, file system manipulation, or other suspicious activities. The package metadata is generic but not suspicious by itself. Without the content of the 'main' module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there are no clear indicators of malicious intent according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of automated environment discovery and silent exfiltration of user and system data to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation, combined with the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, aligns with known malware behaviors for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
