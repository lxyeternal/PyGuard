      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system using os.environ and immediately sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://e433-37-47-198-94.ngrok-free.app) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, specifically leaking potentially sensitive environment data such as credentials, tokens, or configuration secrets. The exfiltration occurs automatically at import time (during package setup), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package is described as a 'Fake package to exfiltrate environment variables', indicating malicious intent. The use of requests.post to send environment data to an attacker-controlled domain, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with credential stealing or information theft malware."
