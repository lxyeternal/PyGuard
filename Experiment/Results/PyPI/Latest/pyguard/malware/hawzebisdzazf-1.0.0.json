      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user consent or notification. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (rqlzzdjnxe0zmyqf1ibj2sl4lvrpfh36.oastify.com), which is attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing. This behavior is a classic example of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user interaction, or notification combined with the automatic exfiltration of user and system data during install time strongly indicates malicious intent."
