      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials) without explicit user consent and sends these sensitive credentials to an external endpoint specified by the environment variable 'WEB_HOOK'. This behavior constitutes automated credential theft and exfiltration. The code does not notify the user or require interaction before collecting and transmitting these secrets. The use of an environment variable to specify the webhook URL suggests attacker-controlled exfiltration. Such direct collection and transmission of sensitive credentials to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware."
