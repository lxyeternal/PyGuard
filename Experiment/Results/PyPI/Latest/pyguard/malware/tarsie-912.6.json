      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' immediately after the package is installed. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. Executing code during installation is a known vector for malware to run payloads, collect information, or perform unauthorized actions on the user's system. The package name 'tarsie' and version '912.6' appear unusual and may be suspicious. The code does not show what 'main()' does, but the pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation is strongly associated with malicious intent, as it bypasses normal user control and can lead to remote code execution or system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing or system fingerprinting malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple external URLs further suggests attempts to evade detection or ensure data delivery. Therefore, this code exhibits automated, non-interactive data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
