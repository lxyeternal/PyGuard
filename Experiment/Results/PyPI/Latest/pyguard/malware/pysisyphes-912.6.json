      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (not standard or reputable endpoints). The use of randomized query parameters and encoding of environment data in the URL query string is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential or environment information stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are non-standard and likely malicious. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior related to unauthorized data exfiltration."
