      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a classic malicious pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. It imports base64 and zlib modules to decode and decompress a large, opaque byte string, then immediately executes the resulting code using exec(). This technique is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the true payload from static analysis and executes arbitrary code at install time without user consent or interaction. The presence of this obfuscated exec call directly after a standard setuptools setup() call suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. Such behavior is almost exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of code injection, payload delivery, or remote code execution attacks. There is no legitimate reason for this pattern in a benign package, especially given the lack of transparency, user notification, or validation of the decoded payload."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses multiple layers of obfuscation by first decompressing a zlib-compressed byte string and then base64-decoding the result before executing it with exec. This pattern of multi-layered decoding followed by immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malicious code used to conceal payloads and evade static detection. The use of exec on dynamically decoded data without any validation or user interaction strongly indicates arbitrary code execution capability, which is a critical risk behavior. Such obfuscation and direct execution are almost exclusively observed in malware samples and are not typical of benign software. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
