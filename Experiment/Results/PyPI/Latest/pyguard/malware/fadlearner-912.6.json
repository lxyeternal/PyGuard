      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation strategy for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically retrieved or encoded code. The package name and metadata are generic and do not indicate suspicious intent. The code does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions during installation beyond invoking a local function. This pattern is common in packages that need to perform post-installation setup or initialization. Therefore, based on the provided code and the extensive knowledge points, this code does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs for data exfiltration, aligns with known malware behaviors for system fingerprinting and reconnaissance. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
