      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, file system manipulation beyond standard installation, or any other suspicious behavior. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. The code does not perform any direct data exfiltration, shell command execution, or environment variable harvesting. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to fully exclude malicious intent, but based solely on this code, it does not exhibit any known malicious patterns or indicators."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of automated environment discovery and silent exfiltration of user and system data to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent combined with the use of multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs for data exfiltration aligns with known malware techniques for reconnaissance and credential theft. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious."
