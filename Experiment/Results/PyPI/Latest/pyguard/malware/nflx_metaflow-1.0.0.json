      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the public IP address (via an external API), the hostname, and the current working directory, then immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, this data collection and exfiltration occurs at package setup time, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of hardcoded external endpoints, automated data collection, and silent transmission of potentially sensitive environment information without user notification or legitimate purpose classifies this code as malicious."
