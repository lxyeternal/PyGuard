      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the local machine and sends it as a query parameter to a remote URL that is obfuscated via base64 encoding. The URL decodes to a suspicious domain (likely attacker-controlled). The code disables SSL verification, which is often used to bypass security checks. It performs an automatic HTTP GET request to this external server without any user interaction or notification, effectively exfiltrating system information (hostname). The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the silent transmission of environment data to an external endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with data exfiltration or system fingerprinting behavior commonly observed in malware."
