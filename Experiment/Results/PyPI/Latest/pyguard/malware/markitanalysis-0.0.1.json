      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a shell command to get the hostname, collects environment variables including a GitHub token and repository information, and makes an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious ngrok-free.app URL. The POST payload includes potentially sensitive information such as the host's public IP address, hostname, repository URL, and a token (which may be a secret). The use of a hardcoded external endpoint (https://393a-2405-201-c009-10-de53-9b2d-918b-cb65.ngrok-free.app/fetch_readme) for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code disables SSL verification, which further suggests an attempt to evade detection or interception. Executing such network communication during package installation, especially to an untrusted external server, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification for this data collection and exfiltration. This behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of automated data exfiltration during package installation, making the code malicious."
