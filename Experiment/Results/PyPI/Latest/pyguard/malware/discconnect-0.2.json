      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file using the Windows API call WinExec without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware, as it leverages the package installation process to silently fetch and run potentially malicious code on the victim's system. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct download and execution of an untrusted binary, strongly indicates malicious intent."
