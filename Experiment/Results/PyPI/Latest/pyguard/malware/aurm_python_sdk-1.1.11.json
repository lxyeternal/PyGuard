      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables persistent execution of potentially untrusted remote code on the user's system without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses all exceptions and does not validate or sanitize the downloaded content before writing or scheduling its execution. This pattern of downloading and persistently executing remote code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded external URL, silent file writes to user home directories, and modification of shell startup files without notification or validation are critical risk indicators of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
