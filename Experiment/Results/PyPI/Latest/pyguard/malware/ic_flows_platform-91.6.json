      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, file system manipulation beyond installation, or any suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or credential theft. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the main module, no direct malicious behavior can be confirmed. Based on the code shown and the provided knowledge points, this code does not exhibit characteristics of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the collection of environment and user identity information and transmission to unknown external servers, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further confirming the malicious nature of this code."
