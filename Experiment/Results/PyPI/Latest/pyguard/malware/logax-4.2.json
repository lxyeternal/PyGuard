      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded strings to hide a remote URL and a filename, which it decodes at runtime. It then checks for a marker line in a __init__.py file of a package named 'logax' (likely to avoid repeated execution). If the marker is not present, it downloads a file from the decoded URL and saves it with the decoded filename. After downloading, it immediately executes the downloaded file using os.system without any validation or user consent. This sequence of obfuscation, remote file download, and execution is a classic malware pattern for payload delivery and execution. The hardcoded base64-encoded URL points to a suspicious domain (download843.mediafire.com) with a long path, which is typical for attacker-controlled payload hosting. The code performs these actions silently and only logs input data to a local log file afterward, indicating stealthy behavior. There is no user interaction, no integrity checks, and no legitimate business logic justifying these operations. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
