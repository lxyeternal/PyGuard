      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in a Python package setup. During installation, it constructs an obfuscated URL by decoding a list of ASCII codes into a string, which resolves to a raw GitHubusercontent URL hosting a shell script named 'setup_monerooceans_miner.sh'. It then attempts to run subprocess commands that execute 'bash' with the '--version' argument (likely as a check), and then runs a shell command that downloads the script from the remote URL using 'curl' and pipes it directly to 'bash' with a long, obfuscated argument string. This means that during package installation, arbitrary code is fetched from a remote, attacker-controlled source and executed without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscation (character code lists), silent subprocess execution with output suppressed, and execution of remote code during install are hallmark indicators of a supply chain attack and remote code execution malware. The package name and description ('Not the package you are looking for') also suggest deception. This behavior is strongly associated with malicious intent, specifically the silent installation of a cryptocurrency miner or similar payload from an external source during package installation."
