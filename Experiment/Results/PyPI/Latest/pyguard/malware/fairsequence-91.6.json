      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code execution occurs automatically at install time without user interaction or consent. Such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages, as it hijacks the trusted installation workflow to run potentially harmful code on the user's system. The setup script does not provide any indication of what 'main()' does, but the pattern of executing code during installation is strongly associated with malware. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. Given the automatic execution of code on install and the lack of transparency or user consent, this pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The data exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses from system commands and the subsequent encoding and transmission to suspicious endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the domains used are not known trusted endpoints. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
