      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses obfuscation by constructing strings from multiple short, meaningless variable names and then dynamically executes code using eval during the package installation process. Specifically, the function 'custom_command' concatenates obfuscated string fragments to form a command string and then calls eval on it. The eval argument is constructed as funky_town + f\"('{combo + wombo}')\" where funky_town resolves to 'os.system' and combo + wombo resolves to a string that appears to be a shell command. This means the code executes an OS shell command during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval), and execution of shell commands during setuptools install hooks is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code is designed to run automatically on install, which is typical for malware. The obfuscation and eval usage to run shell commands is almost never used in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
