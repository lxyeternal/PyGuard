      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a lambda function that performs base64 decoding followed by zlib decompression on a reversed byte string, then immediately executes the resulting code using exec. This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (reversing, base64 encoding, zlib compression) combined with direct execution of the decoded payload is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such obfuscation is commonly used to hide the true nature of the payload and evade static detection. The immediate execution of dynamically decoded and decompressed code without any validation or user interaction is a hallmark of malware, often used to deliver and run arbitrary, potentially harmful code. Given the absence of any benign context, the use of exec on obfuscated data, and the known risk patterns, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
