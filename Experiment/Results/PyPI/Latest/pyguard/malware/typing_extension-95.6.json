      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. The package name 'typing_extension' and version '95.6' appear suspicious and may be an attempt at typosquatting or masquerading as a legitimate package. The automatic execution of code during install, especially from an external module, is a critical risk indicator for malicious intent, as it can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the user's system without their knowledge. The presence of install_requires including 'requests' and 'psutil' suggests potential for network communication and system information gathering, which are common in malware. Overall, the code abuses the setuptools install hook to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a known vector for malware and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and transmission to non-standard, suspicious domains, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the domains used are not associated with any known benign services. Therefore, this code is performing automated, covert data exfiltration and is malicious."
