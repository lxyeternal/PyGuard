      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, it decodes base64-encoded strings that form Python code and immediately executes them using exec(), which is a classic pattern for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads. The base64 strings decode to 'import os' and 'os.system(\"whoami > poc.txt\")', which runs a shell command to write the current user identity to a file named 'poc.txt' without user consent or notification. This is a direct execution of shell commands constructed from decoded data, a hallmark of malicious intent. Additionally, the code uses eval() on a decoded string constructed from hex-encoded bytes that form a shell command, further indicating dynamic execution of potentially harmful commands. The use of obfuscation (hex and base64 encoding) combined with immediate execution (exec and eval) without validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also collects system information (user identity) and writes it to a file covertly, which could be a precursor to data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and unauthorized system command execution."
