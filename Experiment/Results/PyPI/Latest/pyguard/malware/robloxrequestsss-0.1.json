      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external Dropbox URL and saves it to the current working directory with a suspicious filename ('634364.pyw'). It then immediately executes this downloaded script using 'pythonw.exe' via PowerShell without any user interaction, consent, or validation of the downloaded content. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The use of subprocess calls to spawn PowerShell commands for downloading and executing external code, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such automated download and execution of untrusted code during installation is a high-risk behavior exclusively associated with malware and supply chain attacks."
