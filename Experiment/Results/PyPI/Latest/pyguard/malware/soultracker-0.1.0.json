      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates and installs a backdoor script on the target system without user consent or notification. It writes a Python script named 'backdoor.py' (hidden in user directories) that continuously fetches commands from a hardcoded remote server URL ('http://your-server-ip:4352/get-command') and executes them directly on the system using os.system(). This enables remote arbitrary command execution, which is a classic backdoor behavior. The script is set to run immediately in the background and is configured to persist by adding itself to the system startup (Windows startup folder or appending to .bashrc on Linux/macOS). The lack of any user interaction, the use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled server URL, the automatic background execution, and the ability to run arbitrary shell commands remotely are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment variable usage to write hidden files, remote command retrieval and execution, persistence mechanisms, and stealth execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
