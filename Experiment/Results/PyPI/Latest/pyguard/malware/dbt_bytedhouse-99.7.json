      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to non-standard, suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of multiple obscure external domains for data transmission, aligns with known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and reconnaissance. Therefore, this code is performing automated, unauthorized data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
