      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.45.75) on port 4444 and redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. It then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This behavior is a classic reverse shell, which allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine. Such reverse shells are a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) and backdoors, enabling unauthorized remote control and potential further compromise. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic, and the code directly facilitates remote command execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
