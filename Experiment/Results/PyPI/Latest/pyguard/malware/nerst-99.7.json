      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package name 'nerst' and metadata are generic but not suspicious or typosquatted. The code does not perform any direct data exfiltration, shell command execution, or other typical malicious behaviors. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is not possible to fully guarantee safety, but based on this code alone and the provided knowledge points, this setup script does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains that are not associated with any legitimate service. The data is sent as URL query parameters, which is a common technique for stealthy data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code performs automated network communication immediately upon execution. This pattern of environment discovery combined with automated data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential or environment information stealing malware."
