      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the entire environment variables of the host system, encodes them in base64, and sends them via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://fopdbzseohtgcssjzenyswebrkpo7g68i.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, where sensitive environment information (which may include credentials, tokens, or system configuration) is stealthily transmitted to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection by security tools. Additionally, the code executes a shell command ('env') via subprocess.call, captures its output, encodes it, and sends it again to the same suspicious endpoint, further indicating environment reconnaissance and data leakage. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling, and the external domain is non-standard and likely attacker-controlled. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."
