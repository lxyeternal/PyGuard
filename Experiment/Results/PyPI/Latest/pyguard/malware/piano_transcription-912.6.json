      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential or environment information stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of multiple suspicious external URLs for data exfiltration, confirms the code is designed for unauthorized data collection and transmission, which is malicious."
