      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior under the guise of a color formatting utility. It silently collects Telegram Desktop user data from the victim's machine by accessing the Telegram 'tdata' folder in the user's AppData Roaming directory. It compresses this data into a ZIP archive and uploads it to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, using a hardcoded bot API key and chat ID. This exfiltration happens automatically in the background without user consent or notification. The code employs multiple stealth techniques: it runs the backup in background threads and detached watcher processes to ensure completion even if the main program exits; it overrides signal handlers and sys.exit to delay termination until the data exfiltration finishes; it creates temporary hidden scripts and launches them in hidden windows (on Windows) or detached sessions (on Unix) to continue running independently. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, automatic collection of sensitive user data, background exfiltration without user interaction, and stealthy process spawning are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior matches known patterns of credential or data stealing malware that abuses legitimate APIs (Telegram Bot API) for covert data exfiltration."
