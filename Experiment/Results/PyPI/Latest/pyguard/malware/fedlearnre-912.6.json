      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. The only external dependency is 'requests', which is common and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the imported main module, it is not possible to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based solely on this snippet, there are no direct indicators of malicious intent according to the provided knowledge points. The use of code execution during install is a known vector for supply chain attacks, but this code alone does not perform any suspicious actions. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the given information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The use of randomized query parameters and encoding of environment data in the URL query string is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission. This pattern of silent environment fingerprinting and exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential or environment data theft malware. The absence of any benign context, combined with the presence of hardcoded suspicious endpoints and automated data exfiltration, confirms the code is malicious."
