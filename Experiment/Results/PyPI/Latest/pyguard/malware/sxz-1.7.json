      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports base64 decoding and uses it to decode a large base64-encoded string into a binary file named '.Devil'. It then immediately executes this file using a system call to 'python3' with any command-line arguments passed to the script. After execution, it deletes the file. This pattern of decoding an obfuscated payload, writing it to disk, executing it without any user interaction or validation, and then removing the file is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and the transient nature of the payload file strongly indicate an attempt to hide the true intent and evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in benign software, and the use of a hidden filename '.Devil' further suggests malicious intent."
