      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service for a specific service account (405422660992@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com) without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this sensitive access token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a), which is attacker-controlled. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The use of setuptools install hooks to run arbitrary shell commands that collect and exfiltrate authentication tokens without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
