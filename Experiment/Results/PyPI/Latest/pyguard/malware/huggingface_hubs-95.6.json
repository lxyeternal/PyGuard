      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network exfiltration of encoded system identifiers without consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information stealing or reconnaissance malware. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further indicating malicious intent. Therefore, this code exhibits clear signs of automated, covert data exfiltration and is malicious."
