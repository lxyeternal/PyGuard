      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that automatically takes a screenshot of the user's screen during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this screenshot image via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The code also installs required packages during the install process, but the critical malicious behavior is the silent capture and exfiltration of the screenshot during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL used to send user data without notification or consent, combined with execution during package installation, strongly indicates malicious intent."
