      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects the local system's hostname and username, concatenates them into a string, and then constructs a shell command that base64-encodes this data and performs a DNS lookup (nslookup) to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun). This behavior is a classic example of silent data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data, the execution of shell commands during install, and the contact with a suspicious external domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into Python packages to collect and exfiltrate system information stealthily. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
