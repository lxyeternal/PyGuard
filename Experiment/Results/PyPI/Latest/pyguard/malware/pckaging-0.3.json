      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The lack of user interaction, the use of a hardcoded external endpoint for data exfiltration, and the execution of this code during the install phase (via setuptools install hook) are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such behavior is not typical or legitimate in benign packages and aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized environment data collection and exfiltration during installation."
