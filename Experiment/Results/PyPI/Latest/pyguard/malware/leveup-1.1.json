      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports base64 decoding and uses it to decode a large base64-encoded string, which is then written to a file named '.Devil'. Immediately after writing, it executes this file using a shell command 'python3 .Devil' with any command-line arguments passed to the script. Finally, it deletes the '.Devil' file. This pattern of decoding an obfuscated payload, writing it to disk, executing it, and then deleting the file is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscated payload is almost certainly malicious code hidden to evade detection. The script runs the payload without any user interaction or validation, indicating it is designed to stealthily execute hidden code. The use of a hidden filename '.Devil' further suggests malicious intent. There is no legitimate or benign reason for such behavior in typical Python applications. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malware or a malicious dropper."
