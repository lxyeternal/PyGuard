      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused by attackers for data exfiltration. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently collect and exfiltrate system information. The package metadata also uses suspicious naming and a very high version number to override legitimate packages, further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the network communication is automatic and stealthy. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
