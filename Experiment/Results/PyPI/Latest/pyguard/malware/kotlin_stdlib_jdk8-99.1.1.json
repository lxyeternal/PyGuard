      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information (hostname and the current package name) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL that is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The URL is decoded at runtime and contacted without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of obfuscating the remote endpoint and automatically exfiltrating environment data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code uses an unverified SSL context to bypass certificate validation, which is often used to evade detection or interception. Although the code does not execute remote code or write files, the silent collection and transmission of host-specific information to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is consistent with reconnaissance or data exfiltration malware. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the automatic network communication at runtime without transparency or error handling further supports the classification as malicious."
