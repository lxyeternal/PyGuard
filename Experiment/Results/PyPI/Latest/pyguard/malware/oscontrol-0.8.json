      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of encrypted or packed code that hides its true functionality. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with the absence of readable logic and the presence of encoded binary data that is executed at runtime. Given the extensive obfuscation and the use of Pyarmor runtime, it is highly likely that the code is designed to conceal malicious payloads or behavior, such as unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. Without the decryption key or the runtime module, the exact behavior cannot be determined, but the use of this obfuscation technique aligns with known malware delivery and evasion methods."
