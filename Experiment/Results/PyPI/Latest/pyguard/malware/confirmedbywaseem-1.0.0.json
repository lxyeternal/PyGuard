      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that, during the installation process, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfmu6amv5mt5vvq.oast.fun), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, constituting silent data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information. Such use of setuptools install hooks to collect and exfiltrate environment data to an external server is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is non-standard and suspicious, further confirming the malicious nature of this code."
