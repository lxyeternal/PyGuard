      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess call to 'curl' with a hardcoded URL pointing to 'https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c' immediately upon import or execution. This behavior is suspicious because it silently sends an HTTP GET request to an external, attacker-controlled webhook URL without any user interaction or notification. Such automatic network communication during package setup or import is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used for data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, or signaling to a command-and-control server. The rest of the code is a typical setuptools setup script, but the presence of this subprocess call to an external webhook during setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform such network communication automatically, making this code malicious."
