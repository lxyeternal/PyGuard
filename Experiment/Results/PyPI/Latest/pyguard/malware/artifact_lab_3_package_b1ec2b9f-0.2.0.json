      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system by converting os.environ to a string, then encodes this data in base64. It then sends this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://upnasfwuhrawecezwlst8birymund77bc.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive environment data, use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, and communication with an attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domain is non-standard and suspicious. Such automated environment data exfiltration is a hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
