      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the system's temporary directory, extracts its contents, and then attempts to execute an executable named 'ore-miner.exe' from the extracted folder. The execution is done in a subprocess with flags that hide the window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW and DETACHED_PROCESS), indicating stealthy execution. The entire operation is launched in a separate thread immediately upon import or execution, which is a common evasion technique to avoid detection. The obfuscated variable names and lack of error reporting further suggest an attempt to conceal the true intent. This pattern—automatic download, extraction, and execution of a remote binary in a hidden manner—is a classic hallmark of malware, such as a downloader or dropper, used to fetch and run malicious payloads on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
