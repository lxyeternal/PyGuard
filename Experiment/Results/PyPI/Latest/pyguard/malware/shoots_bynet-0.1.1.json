      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the local machine and encodes a URL in base64 to obfuscate the remote endpoint. It then decodes this URL and appends the hostname as a query parameter, sending this information via an HTTPS GET request to a suspicious, obfuscated external server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, combined with automatic, silent exfiltration of host information without user consent or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors that perform environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Although the code does not execute remote code or write files, the covert collection and transmission of system identity data to an unknown external server is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware."
