      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the local machine and sends it as a query parameter to a remote URL that is obfuscated via base64 encoding. The URL decodes to a suspicious domain (likely attacker-controlled). The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, combined with automatic network communication without user interaction or consent, is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. The code disables SSL verification, which is often used to bypass security controls. Although it only prints the response content, the pattern of collecting environment information and sending it to an obfuscated external server is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance or data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate user notification or business logic justifying this behavior, and the obfuscation suggests intent to evade detection."
