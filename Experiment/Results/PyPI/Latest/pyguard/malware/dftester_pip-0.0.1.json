      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads remote payloads from attacker-controlled URLs (GitHub repository '0xe2d0/evil-pip') during package installation and executes them without user consent or validation. It dynamically fetches reverse shell scripts for Linux and Windows, modifies them to use a hardcoded attacker IP (10.0.0.1) and port (4444), and executes them in the background using subprocess.Popen. This behavior enables remote code execution and establishes reverse shells, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim's system. The code runs automatically during installation (via setuptools.setup), without any user interaction or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The use of network retrieval of executable code and immediate execution, combined with hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, is a strong and definitive indicator of malicious intent."
