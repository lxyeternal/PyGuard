      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent or notification. It then constructs URLs with these details encoded as query parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external domains that appear attacker-controlled (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, and the targeting of unusual domains further support the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data exfiltration, consistent with known malware patterns."
