      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL and a filename, which it decodes at runtime. It then attempts to locate a directory associated with a suspiciously named package 'logax' (which is not a known standard or reputable package), and downloads a file from the decoded URL into that directory. After downloading, it immediately executes the downloaded file in a hidden window (using subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW), without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of decoding an obfuscated URL, downloading an executable from a remote source, saving it to a package directory, and executing it silently is a classic pattern of malware that delivers and runs a payload from a remote server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and filename, the silent execution, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification further confirm the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
