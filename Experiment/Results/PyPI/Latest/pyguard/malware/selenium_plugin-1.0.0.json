      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded external URL (https://store9.gofile.io/download/web/354c4da7-4bcb-4186-9d47-847d7a0553c2/folder.zip) into the user's APPDATA directory, extracts it, searches for an executable (.exe) within the extracted contents, deletes the ZIP file, and then adds a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to run the found executable at user login with the name 'Runtime Broker'. This sequence is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to silently deploy and execute potentially untrusted code without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external URL to download executable code, writing it to a system-related user directory, and modifying the Windows registry to achieve autostart persistence are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no validation, user interaction, or transparency in the process, and the executable is run under a misleading name ('Runtime Broker') to evade detection. These behaviors align with known malware patterns involving automated download and execution of payloads, stealthy persistence, and potential system compromise."
