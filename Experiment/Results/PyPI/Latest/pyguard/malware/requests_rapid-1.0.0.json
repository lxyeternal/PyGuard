      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code implements a setuptools installation hook that automatically collects detailed user and system information during the package installation process without explicit user consent. It gathers username, hostname, OS type and version, private and public IP addresses, and approximate geolocation data. This information is then sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external server IP address (199.189.85.8) on port 5000. The data collection and exfiltration occur silently during installation, leveraging a custom install command that runs automatically, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Although the code explicitly states it does not collect passwords, the collection and transmission of personally identifiable information (PII) and system details to an external server without clear user authorization is a hallmark of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with known malicious supply chain attacks that abuse Python package installation hooks to perform covert data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled server details, automatic background network communication during install, and user environment fingerprinting collectively indicate malicious intent."
