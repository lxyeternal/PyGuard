      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in a Python package setup. During installation, it constructs an obfuscated URL by decoding a list of ASCII codes into a string, which resolves to a raw GitHubusercontent URL hosting a shell script named 'setup_monerooceans_miner.sh'. It then attempts to run two subprocess commands: first, it runs 'bash --version' (likely a check for bash availability), and second, it executes a shell command that downloads the remote script using 'curl' and pipes it directly to 'bash' with a long argument string (likely a token or configuration). The subprocess call suppresses all output and errors, and the entire operation is wrapped in try-except blocks that silently ignore exceptions. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The code effectively downloads and executes a remote shell script from an attacker-controlled URL during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation of the URL and command strings, silent failure handling, and execution of remote code during install are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing unauthorized code on the victim's system during package installation."
