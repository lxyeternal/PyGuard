      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, file system manipulation beyond installation, or any suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or credential theft. The package name and metadata are generic and do not indicate typosquatting or suspicious intent. The code does not perform any shell command execution, does not import suspicious modules, and does not contain any of the typical malicious patterns described in the knowledge base. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to fully guarantee safety, but based solely on this setup script, there is no indication of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints without consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent network communication further support this assessment."
