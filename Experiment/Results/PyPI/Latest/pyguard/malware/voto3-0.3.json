      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of system-identifying information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The code executes this data exfiltration without any user interaction or legitimate business logic, leveraging the setuptools install hook to run code at install time, a known vector for malware. The presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL and the automatic network communication to it during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
