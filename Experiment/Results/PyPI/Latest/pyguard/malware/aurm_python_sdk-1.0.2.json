      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PreferredSettings) that, during the package installation process, silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script automatically in common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), ensuring the script runs on every new shell session without user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes remote code retrieval and persistent execution, which is a classic hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The code performs these actions without any user interaction, validation, or integrity checks, and the downloaded code is executed implicitly on shell startup, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. Such automated, silent downloading and execution of remote code during package installation is strongly associated with malware and is a critical security risk."
