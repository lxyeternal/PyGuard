      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs during package installation without user interaction or consent. The hardcoded external endpoint is not a known trusted source, and the network communication is automatic and silent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a custom setuptools install command to trigger network communication during installation is a known vector for remote code execution and data exfiltration in malicious Python packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with these network calls, and the package name 'aws-glue' could be an attempt at typosquatting or masquerading as a legitimate package. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and unauthorized data exfiltration."
