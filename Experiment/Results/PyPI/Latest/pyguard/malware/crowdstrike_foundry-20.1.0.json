      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding the install command with a custom PostInstallCommand class. During installation, it automatically collects sensitive system information including the IP address, hostname, OS details, and the absolute path of the script file without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL, lack of user notification, and automatic network communication during install strongly indicate malicious intent. Such code can be used to fingerprint victim systems and leak sensitive environment information to attackers, enabling further exploitation or targeted attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code automatically triggers the function send_data_to_webhook with the output of collect_system_info immediately upon import, without any user interaction or consent. This pattern matches a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior, as it silently collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external webhook. Such automated data collection and transmission without user notification or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or information stealers. The use of a webhook for data exfiltration is suspicious and commonly associated with attacker-controlled endpoints. The code lacks any benign context, error handling, or user consent, strongly indicating malicious intent."

This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system data without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL controlled by a third party is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables attackers to gather environment and host information for reconnaissance or further exploitation. Although the code does not perform direct code execution or file manipulation, the pattern of collecting sensitive system metadata and exfiltrating it to an external endpoint without notification or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with automated data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."
