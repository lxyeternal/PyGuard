      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses multiple layers of obfuscation: it reverses a base64-encoded string, decodes it, then decompresses it using zlib, and finally executes the resulting code with exec. This pattern of obfuscation combined with immediate execution of decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to hide payloads and evade detection. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or legitimate context before executing the decoded payload further supports this. Such behavior is typical of malware that delivers and runs hidden or dynamically generated malicious code, potentially for purposes such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise."
