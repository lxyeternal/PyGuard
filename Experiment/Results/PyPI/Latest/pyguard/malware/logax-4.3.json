      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded strings to obfuscate a remote URL and a filename, which it decodes at runtime. It then attempts to locate a package directory named 'logax' and constructs a path to a file within that directory using the decoded filename. If a marker string ('#[//]') is not found in the package's __init__.py file, the code downloads a file from the decoded remote URL and saves it to the constructed path. Immediately after downloading, it executes the downloaded file using os.system without any validation or user consent. After execution, it appends the marker string to the __init__.py file to prevent repeated downloads and executions. This sequence—obfuscated remote URL, downloading executable code from an external source, saving it to disk, and executing it silently—is a classic pattern of malware that dynamically fetches and runs potentially untrusted payloads. The lack of user interaction, the use of obfuscation, and the execution of remote code without integrity checks or warnings strongly indicate malicious intent."
