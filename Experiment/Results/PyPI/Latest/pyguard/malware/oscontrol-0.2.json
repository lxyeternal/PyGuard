      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and wrapping them. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of obfuscated or encrypted payloads that are decrypted and executed at runtime. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when no legitimate context or user interaction is present. The code does not show any benign behavior or legitimate application logic and is consistent with malware techniques that hide payloads to evade detection. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and the use of Pyarmor runtime with encrypted data, this code is highly likely to contain malicious behavior."
