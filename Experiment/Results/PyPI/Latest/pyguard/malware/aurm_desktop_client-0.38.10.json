      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script automatically in the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), ensuring persistence across shell sessions. This behavior involves remote code retrieval and automatic execution without user consent or validation, which is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code suppresses errors and performs these actions silently during installation, indicating an intent to evade detection. Such automated downloading and execution of untrusted code during package installation is strongly associated with malicious activity."
