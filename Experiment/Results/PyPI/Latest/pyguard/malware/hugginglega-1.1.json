      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to import the 'transformers' module and, if successful, immediately executes a shell command via os.system that downloads and executes a script from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.3.209.43/favicon.txt). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it fetches code from an untrusted remote source and executes it without user interaction or consent, uses a hardcoded external IP address, and performs direct shell execution of downloaded content. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate context or user notification, making this code highly suspicious and malicious."
