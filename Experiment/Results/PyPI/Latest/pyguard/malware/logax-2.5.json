      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a base64-encoded URL and saves it to a base64-decoded filename in the current working directory without any user interaction or validation. It then executes this downloaded file as a shell command using os.system. The code also modifies the local '__init__.py' file by appending a marker line to prevent repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and filename, combined with automatic download and execution of an external file, is a classic pattern of malware that fetches and runs potentially untrusted or malicious payloads. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user consent, or security checks. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated remote URL, file download and execution, lack of user notification, and persistence mechanism via the '__init__.py' marker. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
