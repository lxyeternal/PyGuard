      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard, and likely attacker-controlled domain (https://qkqwtmfhcgmiadhtmgmbbkugp4w1lxavf.oast.fun) without any user interaction or notification. The domain uses a randomized subdomain and a non-legitimate top-level domain (oast.fun), which is commonly associated with security testing or malicious command-and-control infrastructure. Although the code only prints the response text, the presence of a hardcoded suspicious URL and automatic network communication to an untrusted external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving contacting attacker-controlled endpoints for data exfiltration, command retrieval, or remote control. There is no legitimate context, validation, or user consent, and the code is minimal and silent except for printing the response, which may be a staging or reconnaissance step in a larger malicious workflow."
