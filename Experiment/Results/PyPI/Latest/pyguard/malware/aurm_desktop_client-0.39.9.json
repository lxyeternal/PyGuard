      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script automatically in the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), ensuring the script runs on every new shell session. This behavior constitutes remote code retrieval and persistence without user consent or notification. The downloaded code is executed indirectly by adding it to shell initialization files, which is a classic persistence and remote code execution technique often used in malware and supply chain attacks. The absence of any validation, user interaction, or integrity checks on the downloaded content, combined with automatic execution on shell startup, strongly indicates malicious intent."
