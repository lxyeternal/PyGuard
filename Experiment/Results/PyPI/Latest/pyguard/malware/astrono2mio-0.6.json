      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including multiple layers of base64 decoding and lzma decompression, to conceal its true payload. The code executes decrypted and decompressed code dynamically using exec(), which is a hallmark of malware attempting to hide its actions. It performs environment checks to detect debugging or sandbox environments and avoids execution if suspicious conditions are met. The code is embedded in a setuptools installation hook, meaning it executes automatically during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. It imports cryptographic libraries to decrypt payloads, indicating the payload is hidden until runtime. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the execution of hidden payloads, strongly suggest intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The code also terminates the process if certain conditions are met, further indicating anti-analysis behavior. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden malicious payloads during installation, which is a critical security risk."
