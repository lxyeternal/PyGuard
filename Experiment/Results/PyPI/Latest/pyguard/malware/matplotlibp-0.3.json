      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system name (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these pieces of information, and sends them as a query parameter in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, the lack of user interaction or consent, and the execution of this code during the install phase (via setuptools install hook) strongly indicate malicious intent."
