      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord authentication tokens in local storage directories of Discord and various browsers, which are sensitive credentials. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64 for exfiltration. It also reads Minecraft client account credentials from local configuration files. All this collected sensitive data is sent automatically to a hardcoded webhook URL that is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, indicating an attempt to obfuscate the exfiltration endpoint. The code performs these actions silently without any user interaction or notification. The combination of environment reconnaissance, credential theft, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled webhook is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-driven functionality justifying these operations. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive user credentials and system information for unauthorized remote collection."
