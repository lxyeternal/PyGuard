      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts that decrypt and execute the actual payload at runtime. Such obfuscation is often used to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized code execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of encrypted payloads executed dynamically, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, such as hiding the true intent and potentially executing unauthorized or harmful actions without user consent or visibility."
