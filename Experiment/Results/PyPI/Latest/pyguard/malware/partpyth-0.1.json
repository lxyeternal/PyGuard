      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform unauthorized actions during package installation. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, external GitHub URL directly into the current working directory without user consent or validation. After confirming the file's existence, it immediately executes the downloaded executable using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The absence of any user interaction, integrity checks, or legitimate business logic combined with the automatic download and execution of a potentially untrusted binary strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a high-risk indicator of compromise."
