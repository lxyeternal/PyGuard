      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the local machine and encodes a URL in base64 to obfuscate the destination. It then decodes this URL and appends the hostname as a query parameter before making an HTTPS request to a suspicious, obfuscated external domain. This behavior is consistent with automated, silent exfiltration of system information (host fingerprinting) without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, combined with sending environment information to an external server, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Although the code does not execute remote code or write files, the pattern of environment discovery and data exfiltration to an obfuscated, hardcoded URL is a hallmark of malware or information-stealing tools."
