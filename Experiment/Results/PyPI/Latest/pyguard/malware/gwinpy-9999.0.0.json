      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, DNS servers, root directory listing, and contents of /etc/passwd without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this collected data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for capturing exfiltrated data. The data collected includes sensitive environment and system details that can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks. The function is executed immediately (e.g., during package installation or import), indicating automated data exfiltration without user knowledge. This pattern of silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing malware or supply chain attacks."
