      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, attacker-controlled external domain (aeknnnsitysuxpmwevwu8f0o55ek42w0f.oast.fun). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes automatically during installation, without notifying the user or requiring permission, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a non-standard, obfuscated domain and the silent transmission of environment data confirm that this code is designed to stealthily collect and leak system information, consistent with malware patterns observed in Python packages."
