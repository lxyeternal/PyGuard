      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or consent. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. This pattern enables remote code execution on the user's system at install time, which is a critical risk indicator. The code also installs dependencies (requests, psutil) that are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, further increasing suspicion. The lack of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic before executing main() during installation strongly suggests malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the lack of legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the targeting of suspicious external endpoints, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
