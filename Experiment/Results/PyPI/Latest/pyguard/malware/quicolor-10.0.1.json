      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior embedded within an otherwise benign-looking color formatting utility. Specifically, it silently attempts to locate the Telegram Desktop application's data folder on a Windows system, compresses the 'tdata' folder (which contains sensitive Telegram user data), and uploads the resulting ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API. This exfiltration occurs without any user interaction or notification, triggered automatically in the background when color formatting functions are called. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot API key and chat ID to send potentially sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The code also uses threading to run this backup/exfiltration task in the background and attempts to clean up the ZIP file afterward to evade detection. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, use of hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, stealthy background execution, and targeting of sensitive user data directories. Therefore, despite the presence of legitimate color formatting functionality, the embedded Telegram data exfiltration functionality classifies this code as malicious."
