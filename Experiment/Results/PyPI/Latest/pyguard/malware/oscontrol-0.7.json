      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and wrapping them in a runtime loader. The code imports a module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is characteristic of encrypted or packed code that hides its true functionality. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with the absence of any readable logic or user interaction. The code likely decrypts and executes hidden payloads at runtime, which is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis and detection. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and typical use of Pyarmor in malware samples, this code should be considered malicious."
