      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation strategy for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to run the standard installation process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. There is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscated code, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of arbitrary or remote code. The package name and metadata appear generic but not suspicious. The code does not perform any direct data exfiltration, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, or other typical malicious behaviors. While executing code during installation can be a vector for supply chain attacks, this code alone does not demonstrate malicious intent without further context on the 'main' function. Based on the given code and the provided knowledge points, this snippet is benign."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated network communication to suspicious endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration."
