      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it as a query parameter to a remote URL that is obfuscated via base64 encoding. The URL is decoded at runtime to hide the destination, which is a suspicious domain (likely attacker-controlled). The code uses an unverified SSL context to bypass certificate validation, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or interception. This pattern of environment information gathering combined with obfuscated network communication to an external server without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with data exfiltration or system fingerprinting behavior commonly observed in malware."
