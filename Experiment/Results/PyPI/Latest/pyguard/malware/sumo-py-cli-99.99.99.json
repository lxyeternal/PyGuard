      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration (ifconfig or ipconfig), public IP address (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user data without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather environment details combined with immediate network transmission to an external, hardcoded endpoint during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
