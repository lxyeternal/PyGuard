      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It then encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Subsequently, it sends this collected and encoded information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to known legitimate services. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are indicative of attacker-controlled or testing infrastructure often used for exfiltration or command-and-control. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The pattern of environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information-stealing malware. The absence of any benign context, combined with the use of obfuscation and hardcoded suspicious URLs, confirms that this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive host information without user consent."
