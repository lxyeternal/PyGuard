      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA) which likely contain confidential or credential-related information. It then executes shell commands to gather system information (hostname, current user, network configuration) and appends this data along with the sensitive environment variables into a temporary file (/tmp/r). Immediately after, it sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27) without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment discovery, data collection, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The use of os.system calls to execute shell commands and the silent network transmission during setup further confirm malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to collect sensitive system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment discovery, data collection, and automated exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a hallmark of malicious activity, consistent with credential or system information stealing malware. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing, which appears benign, but the presence of this covert data collection and exfiltration in the constructor makes the overall code malicious."
