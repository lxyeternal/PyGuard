      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network request to a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (an Amazon S3 bucket URL) during the setup script execution. It fetches the content of a remote file (package.json) and then immediately executes the fetched content as Python code using eval('exec(code.text)'). This dynamic execution of remotely fetched code without any validation or user consent is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of eval and exec on untrusted remote data, combined with the lack of any integrity checks, user interaction, or logging, strongly suggests that this code is designed to execute potentially harmful payloads fetched from the attacker's server. This behavior is not typical or acceptable in benign packages and represents a high risk of compromise."
