This pattern is sometimes used to perform post-installation setup or initialization. There is no evidence in the given snippet of obfuscation, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, network communication, file system manipulation beyond standard installation, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The package metadata is generic but not suspicious by itself. Without additional context or the content of the main module, this code alone does not demonstrate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 to obfuscate the data. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic in malware. The hardcoded, non-standard domains and the lack of legitimate business logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no benign justification for this pattern of environment discovery combined with covert network exfiltration to suspicious endpoints."
