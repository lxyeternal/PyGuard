      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches Python code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a raw GitHub URL under a user repository with a non-descriptive path) and executes it directly using exec without any validation or sanitization. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. The code also attempts to install the 'requests' module silently if it is not present, which is a common tactic to ensure the environment is prepared for network communication without user consent or notification. There is no user interaction, logging, or safeguards to prevent execution of malicious payloads. This combination of downloading and executing remote code at runtime, especially from an untrusted source, is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
