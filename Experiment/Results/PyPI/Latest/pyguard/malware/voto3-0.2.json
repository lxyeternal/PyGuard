      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to 'https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55'. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL controlled by an attacker, the lack of user interaction or consent, and the execution of network communication during the install phase strongly indicate malicious intent."
