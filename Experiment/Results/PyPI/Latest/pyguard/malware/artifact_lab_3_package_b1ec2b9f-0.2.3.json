      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the entire environment variables of the host system by converting os.environ to a string, then encodes this data in base64. It then sends this encoded environment data via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious domain (fopdbzseohtgcssjzenyswebrkpo7g68i.oast.fun), which appears to be an attacker-controlled server. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. Additionally, the code executes a shell command ('env') via subprocess.call, captures its output (though incorrectly, as subprocess.call returns an exit code, not output), encodes it similarly, and sends it again to the same suspicious endpoint. The combination of environment variable harvesting, base64 encoding, and silent exfiltration to a suspicious external server strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware patterns."
