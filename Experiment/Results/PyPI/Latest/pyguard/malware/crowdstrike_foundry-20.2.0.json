      "malicious_behavior": "The code automatically collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, fully qualified domain name, operating system details, Python version, installed path, current working directory, and a timestamp without any user interaction or consent. It then silently sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/245615f1-8656-4569-a66d-8869e17559fb), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for capturing data. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, specifically automated, non-interactive data exfiltration of system and environment information to a suspicious external server. The lack of error reporting, user notification, or legitimate business logic further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for covert telemetry or reconnaissance, which is a hallmark of malware or spyware."
