      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, automatically downloads an MP3 file from a hardcoded external URL (hosted on Discord CDN) using a PowerShell curl command, saves it to the current working directory as 'b.mp3', and then immediately executes this file via PowerShell's Start-Process command without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code or payload is fetched and executed during package installation. The automatic download and execution of a remote file without validation or user notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands to download and run a file, combined with the execution triggered during the install phase of the package, matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and stealthy execution during installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction to justify this behavior, and the package name and description appear nonsensical, further supporting suspicion. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
