      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user information including system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from multiple Discord and browser storage locations, saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database (though encrypted), and Minecraft account credentials from known client configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated automatically and silently to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive files, regex extraction of tokens, base64 encoding of encrypted passwords, and automated HTTP POST requests to an attacker-controlled webhook are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code is designed to stealthily gather and transmit credentials and tokens, enabling account hijacking and privacy breaches. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including automated data exfiltration, use of hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, and collection of sensitive authentication data."
