      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that automatically collects sensitive system information—public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time—without user interaction or consent. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/), which is not a known or trusted endpoint. This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process, leveraging setuptools install hooks, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of environment discovery, silent data collection, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server without user notification or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware designed to fingerprint and leak victim system details."
