This exfiltration of system information during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code executes this data collection and transmission automatically during the package installation process, which is a known vector for malware to gain information about the victim's environment stealthily. The presence of a hardcoded external server IP, lack of user interaction or notification, and automatic network communication during install strongly indicate malicious intent."
