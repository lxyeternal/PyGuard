      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service for a specific service account (834644959888@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com) without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this sensitive access token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled external URL (https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip). This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of setuptools install hooks to run arbitrary shell commands that silently collect and transmit sensitive credentials to an external server is a classic supply chain attack pattern and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the package name itself ('youreallydontwantthispackage2131') is suspicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
