      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The use of randomized query parameters and the transmission of user and system identifiers to unknown remote servers is a classic pattern of data exfiltration and host fingerprinting commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, indicating malicious intent. This behavior aligns with known malware patterns of silent environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
