      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple layers of encoded and compressed data that is dynamically decoded and executed at runtime. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic attribute access, and imports to hide its true intent. The code fetches data from a suspicious URL (https://pyobfuscate.com) using a regex substitution, which is unusual and indicative of remote code retrieval. It then performs complex decoding and execution of this data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior such as remote code execution or payload delivery. The presence of large base64 or similar encoded blobs, combined with dynamic execution (e.g., eval, exec, or compile) without any user interaction or validation, strongly indicates that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized payloads. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, remote code fetching, dynamic execution, and lack of legitimate user interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
