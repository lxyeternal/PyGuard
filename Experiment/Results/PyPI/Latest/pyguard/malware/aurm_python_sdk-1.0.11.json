      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, automatically downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) without any user consent or notification. It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), ensuring that the downloaded script runs automatically in future shell sessions. This behavior constitutes a supply chain attack vector, as it executes arbitrary code fetched from an external source during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, persistence, and further compromise. The lack of validation, user interaction, or transparency, combined with the automatic execution of remotely fetched code, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including unauthorized code execution during install, persistence via shell profile modification, and downloading and running untrusted code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
