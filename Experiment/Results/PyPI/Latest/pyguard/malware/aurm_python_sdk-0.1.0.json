      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to the user's home directory as a hidden file (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables persistent execution of potentially untrusted, remotely fetched code on the user's system without explicit user consent or notification. The code executes this during the installation phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The lack of validation or integrity checks on the downloaded script, combined with automatic execution on shell startup, constitutes a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are commonly associated with malware that establishes persistence and executes arbitrary code from attacker-controlled servers."
