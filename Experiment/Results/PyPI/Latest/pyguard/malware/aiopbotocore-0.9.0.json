      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that executes a function 'send' immediately after installation. This function collects system information including the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'). It then constructs a URL containing this information as query parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system-identifying information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this network communication in the install hook. Therefore, this code is malicious."
