      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior effectively establishes persistence by ensuring the downloaded script runs automatically in future shell sessions without user consent or notification. The downloaded code is fetched from an untrusted external source and executed indirectly, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern enabling remote code execution. The installation hook performs network communication, file writing to user home directories, and modifies shell configuration files silently, all without user interaction or validation. These actions align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including remote code retrieval and execution during package installation, persistence via shell profile modification, and lack of transparency or user consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
