      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently collects sensitive system information, specifically the user identity (via 'id' or 'whoami' shell commands) and the system hostname, without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eoyyiyqubj7mquj.m.pipedream.net), which is a known service often used for capturing and analyzing incoming requests, commonly abused by attackers for data exfiltration. The suppression of warnings and silent failure handling further indicate an attempt to evade detection. This pattern of automated, covert collection and exfiltration of user and environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
