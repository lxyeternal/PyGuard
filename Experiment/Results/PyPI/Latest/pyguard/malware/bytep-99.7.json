      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to unknown remote servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of multiple suspicious endpoints, aligns with known malware techniques for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
