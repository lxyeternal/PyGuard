      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, DNS servers, root directory listing, and contents of /etc/passwd without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net/gmacpyutil), which is a suspicious webhook endpoint commonly used for data collection by attackers. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation (as indicated by the immediate call to collect_system_info()), which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior. This pattern of silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server during installation is a strong and well-documented indicator of malicious intent."
