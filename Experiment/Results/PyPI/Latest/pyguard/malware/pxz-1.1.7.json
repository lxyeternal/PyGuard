It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) during the package installation process (triggered by the on_install function linked in the setup entry_points). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently gather and transmit sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server. The lack of user notification, the use of a hardcoded suspicious IP address, and the automatic execution on install are strong indicators of malicious intent."
