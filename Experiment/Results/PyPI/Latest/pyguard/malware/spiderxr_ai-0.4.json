      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external API calls without explicit user consent or notification. It then sends this sensitive information, combined with user input and responses from a remote server, to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating user data to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. Additionally, the code makes multiple HTTP requests to suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) with custom headers mimicking a mobile app, which may be used for further data collection or command and control. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID for silent data transmission, combined with automated network communication to non-standard endpoints, indicates malicious intent consistent with data exfiltration malware. There is no user interaction or consent for this data collection and transmission, and the code does not perform any legitimate business logic that justifies this behavior."
