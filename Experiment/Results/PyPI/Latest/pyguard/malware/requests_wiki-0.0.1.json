      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including platform details, hostname, IP addresses, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://38.181.219.70:5000/report), which is indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication occurs automatically after the package setup call, meaning it executes during or immediately after installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata and comments explicitly mention malicious intent ('A malicious package for research purposes'), and the code is designed to run stealthily without notifying the user. Such behavior—automatic collection and exfiltration of system and user data during package installation—is a hallmark of malicious Python packages and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
