      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, non-official GitHub URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) and saves it as 'Anch.exe' in the current working directory without any user consent or validation. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The absence of any validation, user notification, or sandboxing, combined with the direct execution of a potentially untrusted payload, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for payload delivery, remote code execution, or establishing persistence, and is consistently associated with malware samples."
