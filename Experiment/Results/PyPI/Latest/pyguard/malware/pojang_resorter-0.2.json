      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding the install command to execute a post-install function. This function takes a screenshot of the user's screen using PIL's ImageGrab and then silently sends this screenshot image to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or notification beyond a generic print statement. The presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL, automated data collection (screen capture), and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with supply chain attacks where code execution and data exfiltration occur during package installation, which is a known malware vector. The lack of user interaction or explicit consent, combined with the covert transmission of user screen content to an attacker-controlled endpoint, constitutes a privacy breach and malicious data exfiltration."
