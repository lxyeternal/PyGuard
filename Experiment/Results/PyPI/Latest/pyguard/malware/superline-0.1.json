      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a comprehensive credential and information stealer with multiple malicious behaviors. It collects sensitive user data including browser passwords, cookies, history, autofills, Discord tokens, Telegram sessions, crypto wallets, WiFi passwords, system information, screenshots, webcam captures, and game sessions. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and compression to hide payloads and URLs. The code disables Windows Defender protections, attempts UAC bypass, hides its console window, and creates mutexes to avoid multiple instances. It exfiltrates stolen data to attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTP POST requests, including uploading large archives to external file hosting services. It injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord client files to maintain persistence and further compromise. The code also attempts to persist by copying itself to startup folders and self-deletes to evade detection. Network communication is made to suspicious hardcoded URLs, and the code runs stealthily without user consent or notification. These behaviors are hallmark indicators of malware, specifically a credential stealer and backdoor, designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate confidential user information."
