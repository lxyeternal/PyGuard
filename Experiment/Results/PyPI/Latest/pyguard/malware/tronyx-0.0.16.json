      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key (likely sensitive credential data) to a hardcoded external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a suspicious, non-standard domain (mockapi.io endpoint with a random-looking subdomain) for sending sensitive data strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another endpoint on the same domain, possibly to receive instructions or a switch to control further behavior, which is typical in malware command-and-control communication. There is no legitimate business logic, validation, or user consent, and the function name and variable names are obfuscated or misspelled (e.g., 'ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key'), which may be an attempt to evade detection. These factors combined align with multiple key risk indicators and typical malicious behaviors such as credential theft and data exfiltration."
