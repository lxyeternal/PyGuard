      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to import the 'torchvision' module and, if successful, immediately executes a shell command that downloads and executes a script from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://43.155.40.182:8080/favicon.txt) using curl piped directly into bash. This pattern of fetching code from an untrusted external source and executing it without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True to run a remote script directly is a strong indicator of remote code execution and potential compromise. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code silently ignores ImportError, which may be an evasion technique. The hardcoded IP address and direct execution of downloaded content align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise."
