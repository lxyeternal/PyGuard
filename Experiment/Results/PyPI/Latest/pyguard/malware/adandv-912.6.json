      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it imports and executes a function main() from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where arbitrary code execution is triggered automatically during package installation. Such execution can be used to run malicious payloads, collect system information, or perform other unauthorized actions. The package name 'adandv' and version '912.6' appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate packages. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malware for network communication and system monitoring, respectively. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic before executing main() during install strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a well-known vector for remote code execution and payload delivery in Python ecosystems, making this code highly suspicious and likely malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of user and environment information without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the lack of legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the targeting of suspicious external endpoints, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. There is no benign justification for this pattern of environment discovery and automated exfiltration to unknown external servers."
