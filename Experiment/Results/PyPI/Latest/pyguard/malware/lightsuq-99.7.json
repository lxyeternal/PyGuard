      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not contain any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or dynamic code execution beyond the import and call of main(). There is no evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or environment manipulation. The package name and metadata are generic but not obviously typosquatted or suspicious. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered by main(), but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct indication of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The use of randomized query parameters and encoding of environment data in the URL query string is a common technique to evade detection and exfiltrate data stealthily. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission. The domains used are not standard or trusted endpoints and resemble those used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration. This pattern of environment reconnaissance combined with automated data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential or system information stealing malware."
