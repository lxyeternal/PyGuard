      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system, which can include sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, and configuration secrets, without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a ngrok-free.app domain, which is commonly used for temporary or attacker-controlled endpoints). This automated collection and exfiltration of environment data to an external server is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the behavior is triggered automatically upon import. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct environment variable exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
