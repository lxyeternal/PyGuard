      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Then, it sends this collected information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated, silent exfiltration of environment and user data to suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, data encoding, and automated data exfiltration without consent, which are strongly associated with malicious activity."
