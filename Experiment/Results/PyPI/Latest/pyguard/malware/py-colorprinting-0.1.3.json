      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the system's temporary directory, extracts its contents, and then attempts to execute an executable named 'ore-miner.exe' from the extracted folder. The execution is done via subprocess.Popen with flags to hide the window (creationflags combining 0x200 and 0x8), indicating stealthy execution. The entire operation is launched in a separate thread immediately upon import or execution, without any legitimate business logic or user notification. The obfuscated variable names and the pattern of downloading, extracting, and executing a remote binary in the background are classic hallmarks of malware, specifically a downloader or dropper. There is no validation, integrity check, or user consent, and the code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and stealth execution."
