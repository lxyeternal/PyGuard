      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username of the user installing the package. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for data exfiltration or interaction testing. This behavior occurs automatically during installation without any user interaction or consent, constituting silent data exfiltration. The use of a custom install hook to collect and transmit user environment data to an external server is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is suspicious and unrelated to any known trusted service. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
