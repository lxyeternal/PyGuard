      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a Base64-encoded URL and saves it with a Base64-decoded filename, then immediately executes that file using os.system without any validation or user consent. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote file automatically—is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of Base64 encoding to obfuscate the URL and filename further indicates an attempt to hide the true nature of the operation. There is no user interaction or notification before the download and execution, and the code runs automatically on Windows platforms. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as automated retrieval and execution of untrusted code, obfuscation to evade detection, and lack of integrity checks or user consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
