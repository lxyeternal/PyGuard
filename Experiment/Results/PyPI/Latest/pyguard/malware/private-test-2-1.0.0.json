      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it runs a shell command ('ls') to list directory contents, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, and then silently sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware, as it leverages the installation process to gather and transmit system information covertly. The absence of legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation, combined with the hardcoded external endpoint and automated data exfiltration during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent."
