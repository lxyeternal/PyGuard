      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The use of randomized query parameters and encoding of environment data in the URL query string is consistent with data exfiltration techniques. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior for system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration."
