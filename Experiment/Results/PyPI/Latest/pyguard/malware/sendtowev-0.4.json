      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance, including anti-debugging and anti-VM checks, to evade analysis. The code collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, autofill data, browsing history, bookmarks, Discord tokens, and wallet information from various installed browsers and applications. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows cryptographic APIs. The stolen data is then compressed, uploaded to a file hosting service, and exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded Discord webhook URLs and other suspicious remote endpoints. The code suppresses warnings and stderr output to avoid detection, uses threading for stealthy background execution, and terminates processes associated with debugging tools. It also attempts to install required cryptographic modules silently if missing. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs, webhook tokens, and obfuscated variable/function names further confirms malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated information stealer designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user credentials and data without user consent."
