      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or system fingerprinting malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the use of multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs for data exfiltration, aligns with known malware behaviors for reconnaissance and information theft."
