      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed dynamically further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification before executing the decrypted code, which strongly suggests this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads during installation."
