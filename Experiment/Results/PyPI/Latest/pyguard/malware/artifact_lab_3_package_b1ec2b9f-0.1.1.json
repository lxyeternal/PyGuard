      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system by converting os.environ to a string, then encodes this sensitive environment data using base64 encoding. It then sends this encoded environment information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious, attacker-controlled external domain (\"http://csngft88cumgfr3deiig43by9rko6sn7o.oast.fun\") without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This pattern of environment data collection, base64 encoding for obfuscation, and automated exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, typically associated with information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior, and the external domain is not a known trusted endpoint. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious."
