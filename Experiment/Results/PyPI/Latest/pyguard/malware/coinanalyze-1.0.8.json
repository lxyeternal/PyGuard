      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is base64-encoded and, when decoded, reveals Python code that dynamically constructs and executes shell commands involving Python scripts. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn processes with hidden windows (typical of Windows PowerShell hidden execution), and conditionally executes commands based on the existence of certain paths. The code dynamically builds script paths and executes them without user interaction or validation. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the code, combined with dynamic execution of shell commands, subprocess spawning with hidden windows, and conditional execution based on file existence, are strong indicators of malicious intent. These behaviors align with common malware techniques such as stealthy payload execution, evasion, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code concatenates multiple base64-encoded strings, decodes them, and then executes the decoded data using exec(). This pattern of decoding and immediate execution of obfuscated code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of exec on dynamically decoded data, and the obfuscation strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized payloads, which is typical of malware or malicious scripts."
