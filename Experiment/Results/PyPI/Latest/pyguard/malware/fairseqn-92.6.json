      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the collection of environment and user identity information and transmission to non-standard, suspicious domains, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident, and the domains used are not associated with any known benign services. Therefore, this code is performing automated, covert data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
