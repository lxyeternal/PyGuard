      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This dynamic decryption and execution of code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload hide the true intent, and the use of exec on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The setup script also specifies installation requirements for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating the payload is designed to run at install time. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code executes automatically during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious packages designed to compromise systems during dependency installation."
