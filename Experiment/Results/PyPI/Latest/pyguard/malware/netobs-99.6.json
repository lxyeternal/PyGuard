      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, obfuscated (base64-encoded) external URLs that appear suspicious and attacker-controlled. The network communication is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses via system commands (getmac on Windows, ifconfig on Linux/macOS) combined with base64 encoding and exfiltration to multiple external endpoints is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The obfuscation of URLs and the automated, background transmission of sensitive environment data without consent strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code runs automatically when executed. These factors collectively classify the code as malicious, specifically as a data exfiltration or host fingerprinting malware."
