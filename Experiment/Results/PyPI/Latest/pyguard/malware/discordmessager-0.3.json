      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (a Dropbox link) and writes it to a hidden location in the user's home directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded script in the background using subprocess.Popen with 'pythonw', which runs without a console window, indicating stealthy execution. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code dynamically during or immediately after package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The absence of any validation, integrity checks, or user notification before executing the downloaded code further confirms malicious intent. Additionally, the use of a non-standard script path in the user's home directory and silent error logging to a hidden file are typical evasion techniques. Overall, this behavior strongly indicates that the package is designed to deliver and execute potentially harmful payloads from an untrusted remote source, constituting malicious behavior."
