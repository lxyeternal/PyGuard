      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code snippet itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. The install_requires includes common libraries (requests, psutil) which are not inherently malicious. Without the content of the main.main() function, it is not possible to definitively assess the full behavior, but based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points. The code does not perform any suspicious actions during installation beyond invoking a local function, which can be legitimate in some packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The data exfiltration is done silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity data and sending it to unknown external servers, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident in the code, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious. Therefore, this code is performing automated, covert data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
