      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL containing the host's node name and operating system information. This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL for exfiltrating system-identifying information during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it constitutes automated data collection and exfiltration in a supply chain attack vector. Such behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate packages and aligns with known malicious patterns of environment reconnaissance and data leakage triggered during package installation."
