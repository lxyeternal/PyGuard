      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL ('https://blockatlaspro.com/test.py') without any validation or user consent. It writes this script to a hidden file in the user's AppData Local directory under a dynamically generated filename, then executes it silently in a new subprocess with output suppressed. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code dynamically, especially from an untrusted and suspicious domain, is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of ctypes to set the file attribute to hidden further indicates an attempt to evade user detection. The execution is triggered automatically if a local settings file exists, without any user interaction or notification. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and stealth execution, and have no legitimate justification in typical benign software."
