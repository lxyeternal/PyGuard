      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to the user's home directory as a hidden file (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script automatically in the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), ensuring the downloaded code runs on every new shell session. This behavior constitutes remote code retrieval and persistent execution without user consent or notification. The downloaded code is executed indirectly by adding a shell command to startup scripts, which is a classic persistence mechanism. The installation hook performs network communication, file writing to hidden locations, and modifies user environment configuration files to execute potentially untrusted code. These actions align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary remote code execution during package installation, persistence via shell profile modification, and lack of user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
