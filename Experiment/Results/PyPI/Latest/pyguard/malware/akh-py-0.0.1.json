      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes an automatic HTTP GET request to a hardcoded canarytokens.com URL without any user interaction or notification. Canarytokens URLs are typically used as honeypots or tripwires to detect unauthorized access or data exfiltration. The presence of this request indicates that the code silently contacts an external, attacker-controlled server to signal execution or presence of the code on the host system. Additionally, commented-out code shows intent to collect system information (OS details and current working directory) and send it to a Discord webhook, which is a common exfiltration technique. Although the exfiltration code is commented out, the active network call to a suspicious canarytokens domain strongly suggests malicious intent to perform silent data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. The lack of user consent, the use of a suspicious external URL, and the pattern of silent network communication are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
