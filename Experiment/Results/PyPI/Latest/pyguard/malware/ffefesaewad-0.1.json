      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, which is then decoded and executed immediately via exec. This pattern of decoding base64-encoded data and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to hide the true nature of the code and evade detection. Although the decoded payload here is a simple print statement ('print(\"test\")'), the use of exec on decoded base64 data without any validation or user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Such a pattern is almost never used in benign software due to the inherent security risks of executing dynamically decoded code. Therefore, this code exhibits a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
