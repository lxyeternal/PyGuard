      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior under the guise of a color formatting utility. It silently collects Telegram Desktop user data from the victim's machine (specifically the 'tdata' folder in the Telegram Desktop roaming profile directory), compresses it into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it by uploading the archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API. This exfiltration occurs automatically in the background without user consent or notification. The code uses threading and signal handlers to ensure the backup and upload complete even if the main program exits or is interrupted. It also spawns detached watcher processes and background threads to maintain persistence and stealth. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot API keys and chat IDs, combined with the automated collection and upload of potentially sensitive user data, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code attempts to hide its activity by ignoring certain cache and temporary folders, cleaning up the ZIP file after upload, and suppressing exceptions silently. The backup process is triggered automatically on module import and on calls to color formatting functions, ensuring it runs without explicit user action. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, stealth execution, use of background threads and detached processes, and hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints."
