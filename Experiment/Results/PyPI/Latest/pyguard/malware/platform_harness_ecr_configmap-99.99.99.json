      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command and executes automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this collected information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes silent data exfiltration of system and user environment details without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather environment data combined with immediate network transmission to an external, hardcoded endpoint during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
