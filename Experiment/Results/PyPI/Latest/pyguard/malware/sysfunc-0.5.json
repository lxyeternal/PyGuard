      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts, which decrypt and execute the actual payload at runtime. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent when found outside legitimate use cases, as it hides the true behavior of the code. The absence of any readable logic, combined with the use of encrypted payloads executed dynamically, matches known malware techniques for evading detection and analysis. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior due to its obfuscated nature, dynamic execution of hidden payloads, and lack of transparency or legitimate context."
