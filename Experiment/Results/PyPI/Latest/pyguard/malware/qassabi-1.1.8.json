      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is indicative of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting, which are common in supply chain attacks and malware. The use of a hardcoded external IP address for silent data transmission during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages typically do not perform such actions. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
