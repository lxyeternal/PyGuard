It then immediately executes the resulting decompressed code using exec(). This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (reversing the input string, base64 decoding, zlib decompression) followed by direct execution of the decoded payload is a classic hallmark of malicious code. Such obfuscation is used to hide the true intent and content of the payload from static analysis and detection. The immediate execution of dynamically decoded and decompressed code without any validation or user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to deliver and run arbitrary, potentially harmful code such as malware, backdoors, or data stealers. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency or user consent."
