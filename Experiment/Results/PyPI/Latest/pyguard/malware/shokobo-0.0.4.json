      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess call to 'curl' with a hardcoded URL pointing to 'https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c' immediately upon import or execution. This behavior is suspicious because it silently sends an HTTP GET request to an external, attacker-controlled webhook without any user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic. The use of subprocess.run to invoke curl during the setup script execution is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling data exfiltration or remote tracking during package installation. The hardcoded webhook URL is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as webhook.site is commonly used for capturing and monitoring HTTP requests by attackers. There is no benign justification for this network call in a setup script, and it is not related to package installation or dependency management. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with automated data exfiltration or tracking during package installation."
