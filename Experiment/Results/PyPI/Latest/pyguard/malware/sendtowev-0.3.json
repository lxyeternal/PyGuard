      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance, including anti-debugging and anti-VM checks, to evade analysis. The code silently installs required dependencies and suppresses warnings and error outputs to avoid detection. It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, autofill data, browsing history, bookmarks, Discord tokens, and wallet information from various browsers and applications. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows cryptographic APIs. The code archives collected data, uploads it to external file hosting services, and exfiltrates detailed user and system information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It also copies itself to the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence. The use of threading for concurrent data collection and network communication, obfuscated variable and function names, and hardcoded suspicious URLs further confirm its malicious intent. There is no user interaction or consent, and the code operates stealthily in the background, making it a comprehensive information stealer designed to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive credentials and tokens from the victim's machine."
