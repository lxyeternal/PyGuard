      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://ovnabqa0k6gt0vwzch7ovggkabg74xsm.oastify.com). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded, non-standard domain strongly suggests attacker-controlled infrastructure. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration and supply chain compromise. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
