      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a base64-encoded URL and saves it to a base64-decoded filename, both of which are hardcoded and obfuscated. It then executes the downloaded file as a shell command without any validation or user consent. The code also modifies a local '__init__.py' file by appending a marker line to prevent repeated execution. This sequence of obfuscation, remote file download, writing to disk, and immediate execution is a classic pattern of malware used for payload delivery and execution. The lack of user interaction, the use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and filename, and the automatic execution of potentially untrusted code strongly indicate malicious intent."
