      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code immediately after installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, in the custom install class, the run method calls a _post_install function that executes a subprocess call running a Python script or executable named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. The subprocess call uses shell=True with a constructed command string, which can be dangerous and is often used in malware to execute arbitrary commands. There is no indication that the executed 'colotama' is a benign script; instead, this pattern is strongly associated with malicious payload delivery or execution during package installation. The code lacks any user notification, validation, or security checks before executing this post-install command, increasing the risk. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns exploiting Python package installation hooks for arbitrary code execution."
