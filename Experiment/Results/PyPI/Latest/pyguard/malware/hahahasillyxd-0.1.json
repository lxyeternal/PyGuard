      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, automatically downloads an MP3 file from a hardcoded external URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) using a PowerShell curl command without any user interaction or consent. After downloading, it immediately executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process command. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code or payloads are fetched and executed during package installation. The automatic download and execution of a remote file during install time, without validation, user notification, or consent, is strongly indicative of malicious intent. Such behavior can be used to deliver malware payloads, execute arbitrary code, or compromise the host system. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands for downloading and executing files, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user interaction, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code execution and remote payload delivery."
