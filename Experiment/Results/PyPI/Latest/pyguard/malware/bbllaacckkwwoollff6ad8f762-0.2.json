      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools installation process via a custom install command class, which triggers execution of the exec_command() function during package installation without user consent or interaction. The exec_command() function retrieves the current username and, if it matches the string 'modelarts', it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (http://blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/rw/b), reads the response body, and executes it directly using exec(). This is a classic pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary remote code dynamically, which is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise. Additionally, the code contains a function to send base64-encoded data via an HTTP PUT request to the same suspicious domain, indicating potential data exfiltration capabilities, although this part is commented out. The use of hardcoded, non-standard external URLs, dynamic code execution from remote sources, execution triggered automatically during package installation, and conditional execution based on environment (username) are all hallmark signs of malicious supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation of the downloaded code, making this a high-severity threat vector."
