      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that executes a reverse shell command during the package installation process. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell payload that connects back to a hardcoded IP address (124.221.70.199) and port (8876). This payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed immediately via a shell command during the install phase. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, the hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, and the immediate execution of a reverse shell to establish remote command execution on the victim system are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Such code enables an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim's machine, bypassing firewalls and monitoring by initiating outbound connections. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
