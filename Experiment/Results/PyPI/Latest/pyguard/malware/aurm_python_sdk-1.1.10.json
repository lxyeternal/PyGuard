      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to the user's home directory as a hidden file (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script automatically in common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables automatic execution of potentially untrusted, remotely fetched code on the user's system without explicit user consent or notification. The code performs network communication during installation, writes files to user home directories, and modifies shell configuration files to achieve persistence. These actions are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery during package installation. There is no validation, integrity check, or user interaction before downloading and scheduling execution of the remote code, which poses a significant security risk and is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
