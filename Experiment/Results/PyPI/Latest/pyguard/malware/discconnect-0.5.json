      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it attempts to execute this file silently on Windows systems using ShellExecuteW. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary, potentially malicious code is fetched and executed during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of a non-official, external URL to download an executable, writing it to a system-related user directory, and executing it automatically during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
