      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (a Canary tokens URL) during the package installation process. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack pattern where code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent. The immediate outbound HTTP request to a non-standard, hardcoded external URL during setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or triggering further malicious payloads. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this network call, which aligns with known malicious patterns in Python packages that exploit installation hooks for remote code execution or data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an automatic HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://g5mr93si9nwr0vblbcuk1fp4cvim6du2.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is consistent with silent data exfiltration or beaconing to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, the commented-out code indicates intent to collect system information (OS details and current working directory) and send it to a Discord webhook, which is a known method for covertly exfiltrating sensitive environment data. The import statement uses 'request' instead of the correct 'requests' module, which may be a typo or an attempt to evade detection, but the actual call uses 'requests.get', indicating inconsistency or obfuscation. Overall, the code exhibits key risk indicators such as contacting a suspicious external domain automatically and preparing to exfiltrate system information without user consent, which strongly suggests malicious intent."
