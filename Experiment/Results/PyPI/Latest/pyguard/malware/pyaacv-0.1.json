      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform unauthorized actions during package installation. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, external GitHub URL directly into the current working directory without user consent or validation. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The absence of any user interaction, integrity checks, or legitimate business logic, combined with the execution of an untrusted executable, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior enables attackers to deliver and run arbitrary code on the victim's system during a trusted package installation process, posing a critical security risk."
