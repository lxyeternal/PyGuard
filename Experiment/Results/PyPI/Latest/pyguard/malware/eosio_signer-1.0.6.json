      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup that collect system information such as hostname, current user, and network configuration, writing this data to a temporary file (/tmp/r). It then appends sensitive environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA) to this file, which likely contain confidential credentials or tokens. Immediately after, it performs an HTTP POST request using curl to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected data without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment data collection, writing to a temporary file, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling further confirms the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to collect system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address 'http://61.28.229.27', uploading the collected system information file '/tmp/r' without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of gathering sensitive host environment data and exfiltrating it to a remote server is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing, which appears legitimate, but the automatic collection and exfiltration of system information upon object instantiation is suspicious and malicious. There is no indication of user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, the code should be classified as malicious."
