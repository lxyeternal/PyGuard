      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then constructs HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains that are not associated with any legitimate service. The code sends this environment data as URL query parameters to these endpoints, effectively exfiltrating system information. This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated transmission to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance or credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this network activity. The use of randomized query parameters may be intended to evade detection or caching. Overall, the code exhibits hallmark signs of automated, unauthorized data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
