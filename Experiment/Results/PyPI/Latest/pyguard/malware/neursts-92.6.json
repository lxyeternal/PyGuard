      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. There is no evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or environment manipulation. The package metadata and dependencies (requests, psutil) are common and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. Without the content of the imported main module, it is not possible to fully exclude malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup script, the code does not contain any direct malicious behavior or typical indicators of malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. This data exfiltration occurs silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission, combined with the collection of environment and user identity information and the transmission to suspicious endpoints, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware that performs host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to command-and-control servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident in the code, and the domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further supporting the conclusion that this code is malicious."
