      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup phase that downloads a file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (1.13.187.150) using wget, makes it executable, and runs it in the background without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack or remote code execution. The downloaded file named 'pytorch' is likely a malicious payload. The execution is conditional on an environment variable check but otherwise automatic, indicating stealth and evasion. Such automatic downloading and execution of untrusted binaries during package installation is strongly associated with malware and is not a legitimate or benign practice."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses os.system to execute a shell command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, then changes its permissions to executable, and finally runs it in the background with nohup. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted external source and executing it without any user interaction or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. It enables remote code execution and potentially compromises the system by running arbitrary code fetched from an attacker-controlled server. There is no indication of legitimate purpose, user consent, or safety checks, making this code a strong indicator of malware or a malicious payload delivery mechanism."
