      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) with query parameters containing the host's node name and operating system. This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation without any user interaction or consent. The collection and exfiltration of system identifying information (hostname and OS) to an attacker-controlled endpoint during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for capturing and analyzing HTTP requests, further indicates that this is likely an unauthorized data exfiltration attempt. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware and is not typical or legitimate in benign packages."
