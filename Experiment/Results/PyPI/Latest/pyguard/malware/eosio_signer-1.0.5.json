      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup that collect system information such as hostname, current user, and network configuration, writing this data to a temporary file (/tmp/r). It then appends environment variables (likely containing sensitive credentials or keys) to this file. Immediately after, it sends the collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27) without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment data collection, file writing in a temporary location, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling further confirms the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to collect sensitive system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of environment discovery, data collection, and automated exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. The rest of the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, but the unsolicited data collection and exfiltration embedded in the constructor is a critical risk and confirms malicious behavior."
