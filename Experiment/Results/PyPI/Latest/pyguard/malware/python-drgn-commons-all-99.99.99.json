      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this collected data in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather environment details combined with immediate network transmission during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
