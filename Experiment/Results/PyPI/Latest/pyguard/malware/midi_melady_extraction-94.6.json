      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the setuptools install command to run the original install process and then calls a main() function imported from a local module named 'main'. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or execution of dynamically fetched or encoded code. The package metadata is generic and does not indicate suspicious or typosquatted naming. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries and not inherently malicious. Without the content of the 'main' module and its main() function, it is not possible to definitively assess the full behavior, but based solely on this setup script, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code does not match any of the critical or high-risk malicious patterns such as executing remote code during install, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is classified as non-malicious based on the given information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses combined with automated, silent exfiltration of environment and user data to unknown external servers is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The domains used are non-standard and suspicious, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive host information without user consent."
