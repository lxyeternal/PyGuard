      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a base64-encoded URL and saves it to a base64-decoded filename in the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then executes this downloaded file as a shell command using os.system. The code also marks the presence of this action by appending a marker line to an '__init__.py' file to avoid repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and filename, combined with automatic download and execution of remote code, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. There is no validation or integrity check of the downloaded file, no user notification, and the execution is silent and automatic. This pattern is strongly associated with malware that stages and executes payloads from remote sources, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
