      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials) without explicit user consent and sends these sensitive credentials to an external endpoint specified by the environment variable 'WEB_HOOK'. This behavior constitutes automated credential theft and exfiltration. The code does not notify the user or require interaction before collecting and transmitting these secrets. The use of an environment variable to specify the webhook URL suggests attacker-controlled exfiltration. This pattern of silently collecting and sending sensitive credential data to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing malware."
