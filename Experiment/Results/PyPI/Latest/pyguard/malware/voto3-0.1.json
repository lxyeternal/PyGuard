      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system information to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or notification. Specifically, it collects the hostname (platform.node()), the operating system name (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), concatenates these pieces of information, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of system-identifying information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered automatically during installation (without user interaction), strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data transmission, and the pattern matches known indicators of malicious code in Python packaging contexts."
