      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects extensive system information including hostname, current working directory, username, platform details, CPU and RAM info, Python environment paths, and also fetches data from an external API (PokeAPI). It then exfiltrates this collected sensitive system and user information to two hardcoded external endpoints: a Webhook.site URL and a Burp Collaborator (Oastify) URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and transmission of potentially sensitive environment and user data to attacker-controlled servers during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate user notification, consent, or business logic, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious external URLs for data exfiltration during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent."
