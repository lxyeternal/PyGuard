      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a silent network request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://5z5bg56mebksjokqd36na9fbq2wvkl8a.oastify.com) immediately upon import, running this in a background thread to avoid blocking. It first computes the SHA1 hash of the local hostname and compares it to a hardcoded hash, exiting early if it does not match, indicating targeted or conditional execution. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain (oastify.com is commonly used for out-of-band testing and can be abused for exfiltration) combined with silent failure on request errors suggests covert data exfiltration or beaconing behavior without user consent or notification. This pattern of environment fingerprinting (hostname hash check) followed by automatic, stealthy network communication to a suspicious endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with malware that performs host reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The code lacks any legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the network call is triggered automatically on package import, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
