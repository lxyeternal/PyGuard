      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'CBLines.exe' from a hardcoded external URL on GitHub (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly into the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or sandboxing, combined with the direct coupling of network retrieval and execution, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for malware propagation, payload delivery, or system compromise."

It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it automatically is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the host system. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution, increasing the risk of running malicious payloads. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands to download and run an external executable, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent."
