      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior effectively installs a persistent backdoor or remote code execution mechanism that runs arbitrary code fetched from a remote server every time the user opens a shell. The code performs these actions without user consent, notification, or validation of the downloaded content. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during package installation, modifying user shell configuration files for persistence, and suppressing errors is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of a non-standard URL, silent network activity during install, and persistence via shell rc files strongly indicate malicious intent."
