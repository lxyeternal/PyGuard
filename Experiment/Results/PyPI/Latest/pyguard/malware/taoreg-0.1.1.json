      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and zlib compression, then immediately executed via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the true nature of the payload, evades static analysis, and executes arbitrary code dynamically. The use of a lambda function to import modules and decompress a reversed base64 string before execution is a classic obfuscation technique commonly observed in malware. Such code typically contains payloads that perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. The absence of any user interaction, logging, or legitimate business logic, combined with direct execution of decompressed and decoded data, confirms that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is highly obfuscated and uses a lambda function to decode and decompress a base64-encoded and reversed byte string, then immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (base64 decoding, string reversal, zlib decompression) followed by direct execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such techniques are commonly used by malware to conceal payloads and evade static detection. The absence of any user interaction, logging, or validation before execution further supports this conclusion. Given the critical risk patterns described, this code is almost certainly malicious, as it executes hidden code that could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further payload delivery."
