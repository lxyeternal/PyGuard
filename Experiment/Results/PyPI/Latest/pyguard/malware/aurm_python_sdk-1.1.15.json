      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") into the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This ensures that the downloaded script will be executed automatically in future shell sessions, establishing persistence. The downloaded code is fetched from an untrusted external source and executed indirectly without any validation or integrity checks. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware that leverages package installation hooks to deploy and persist malicious payloads on the victim system. The lack of user notification, the use of hidden files, and the automatic execution of remote code during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent."
