      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (Anch.exe) from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (a GitHub raw content URL under a suspicious repository path) directly into the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable silently using PowerShell with no new window and waits for its completion. This pattern of automated download and execution of a remote binary without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or legitimate business logic, combined with the use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell commands for downloading and running an external executable, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code execution from untrusted sources, silent execution, and use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, all of which are consistent with malware propagation or payload delivery."
