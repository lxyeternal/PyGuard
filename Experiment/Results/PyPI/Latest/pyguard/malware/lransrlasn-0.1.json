      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that downloads a file named 'Upower' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://8.138.32.43/), makes it executable, and runs it immediately without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack or remote code execution. The use of os.system to run a shell command that downloads and executes an untrusted binary during installation is strongly associated with malware. The code also conditionally executes this payload based on an environment variable check, which is a common evasion technique. There is no legitimate reason for such network activity and execution in a setup script, and the package name appears random and suspicious. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads a file named 'Upower' from a hardcoded IP address (http://8.138.32.43/), changes its permissions to executable, and then runs it. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary without any user interaction, validation, or consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a direct IP address rather than a known, trusted domain, combined with immediate execution of the downloaded file, strongly indicates a remote code execution attempt typical of malware. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as fetching and executing code from an untrusted external source, lack of user notification, and execution of potentially harmful payloads, all of which are consistent with malicious intent."
