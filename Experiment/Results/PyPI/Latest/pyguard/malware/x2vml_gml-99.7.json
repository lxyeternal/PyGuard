      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it runs the original install process and then imports and calls a main() function from a module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation scripts or setup routines. However, the code itself does not contain any obfuscation, network communication, file system manipulation, or dynamic code execution beyond the import and call of main(). There is no evidence in this snippet of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or stealthy operations. The package name and metadata are generic but not suspicious or typosquatted. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered by main(), but based solely on this setup script, it does not exhibit known malicious patterns or indicators."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains consistent with known malicious infrastructure (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The data exfiltration is automated and performed silently without any user interaction or notification. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple endpoints suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure delivery. This pattern of environment discovery combined with automated data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior."
