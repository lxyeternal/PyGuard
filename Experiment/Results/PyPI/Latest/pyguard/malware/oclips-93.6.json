      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code then sends this collected and encoded information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to known legitimate services. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration without any user interaction or consent. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses across different operating systems further indicates environment reconnaissance. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled domains is a strong hallmark of malicious activity, specifically information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains contacted appear to be attacker infrastructure. Therefore, this code is malicious."
