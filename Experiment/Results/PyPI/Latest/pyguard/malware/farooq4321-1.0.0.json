      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute malicious actions during package installation. It collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then silently exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (oastify.com). Immediately after, it executes a reverse shell command using bash to connect back to a remote server (electronics-affiliate.gl.at.ply.gg) on port 18666, enabling remote command execution on the victim machine. This combination of environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and establishing a reverse shell during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying these actions, and the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs and direct shell command execution confirms the code's malicious intent."
