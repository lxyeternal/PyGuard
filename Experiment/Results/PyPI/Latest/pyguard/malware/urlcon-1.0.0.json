      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string assigned to the variable __safety_token__. Decoding this string reveals a Python expression that imports the 'urllib3' module, creates a PoolManager, performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/BPCvZd82), and accesses the response data. This pattern of embedding obfuscated network requests to fetch remote content is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code is designed to retrieve potentially untrusted or malicious payloads from an external source without user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the network request, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic, aligns with typical malware behavior such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and immediately starts a new thread that executes code via exec(). The executed code is obtained by calling the function 't' with the argument '__safety_token__', both imported from a relative module '__version__'. This pattern of dynamically executing code that is not statically present in the source, combined with immediate background thread execution, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of exec on data that is likely obfuscated or encoded (given the naming '__safety_token__' and function 't') without any validation or user interaction is a classic technique for stealthy payload delivery and execution. The code lacks any benign context, user notification, or legitimate business logic, and the immediate spawning of a thread to run arbitrary code is consistent with evasion and persistence techniques used in malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
