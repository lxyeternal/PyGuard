      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then constructs HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs that appear attacker-controlled. The URLs contain unusual domain names and subdomains that resemble known malicious infrastructure (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The code sends this environment data as URL query parameters, effectively exfiltrating system information to remote servers. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior. This pattern of silent environment data collection and automated exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
