      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the public IP address, hostname, home directory, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080), which is indicative of data exfiltration. This behavior occurs immediately upon execution, including during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of os.popen to run a shell command to retrieve the public IP and the silent network transmission of collected data to an external server without user notification or legitimate purpose strongly indicates malicious intent. Such automated collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation is a hallmark of malware and supply chain compromise."
