      "malicious_behavior": "This code hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during installation. Specifically, it runs pip to install an additional package ('pyprettifier') without user consent, then executes a script or module named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. The use of subprocess.call with shell=True to run these commands during install is suspicious and typical of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to install another package silently and then execute a local script automatically. This behavior can be abused to run arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The code also writes error messages to '/tmp/a' if ImportError occurs, indicating attempts to hide or log errors in an obscure location. Overall, this pattern of executing shell commands during install, installing additional packages without user interaction, and running local scripts is strongly associated with malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution."
