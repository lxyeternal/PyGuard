      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the host machine. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration to suspicious endpoints without consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
