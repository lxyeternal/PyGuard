      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module named '.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and calls a function '__pyarmor__' with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts, which decrypt and execute the actual payload at runtime. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent when found outside legitimate use cases, as it hides the true behavior of the code. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of Pyarmor runtime with encrypted payload, this code likely contains hidden malicious behavior such as executing unauthorized or harmful actions without user consent. Without the decryption key or runtime environment, the exact payload cannot be determined, but the use of Pyarmor in this manner is a known technique to conceal malware. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious."
