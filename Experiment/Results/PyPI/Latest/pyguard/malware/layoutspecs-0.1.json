      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, automatically collects system information including the machine hostname, operating system, and public IP address by querying an external service. It then constructs a URL containing this sensitive information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook-test.com/8caf20007640ce1a4d2843af7b479eb1). This behavior occurs silently during the package installation without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL to exfiltrate system-identifying information during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware patterns. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission, making this code malicious."
