      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any validation or user consent. It writes this archive to the system's temporary directory, extracts its contents, and then executes an executable file (ore-miner.exe) from the extracted folder in a detached, hidden process. This sequence of automated download, file writing to a temporary location, extraction, and silent execution of a potentially untrusted binary is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. The lack of user interaction, absence of integrity checks, and use of subprocess.Popen with flags to hide the process further indicate stealthy, potentially malicious intent. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware that downloads and runs payloads from attacker-controlled servers, often for purposes like cryptomining, backdoors, or other unauthorized activities."
