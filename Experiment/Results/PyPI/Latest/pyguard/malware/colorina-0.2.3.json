      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information such as system details (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), Discord authentication tokens from local storage files, saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database, and Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All these data are then exfiltrated by sending HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs, which are decoded at runtime to hide the true destination. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate webhook URLs, automated silent data collection without user consent or notification, and immediate network transmission of sensitive credentials are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction or business logic and is designed solely to harvest and leak private data to attacker-controlled endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
