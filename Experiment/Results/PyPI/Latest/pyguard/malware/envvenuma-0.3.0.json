      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them as JSON data to a hardcoded Google Chat webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information, which may include credentials, tokens, or other secrets. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for sending this data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables silent transmission of sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Additionally, the subprocess call to 'printenv' and sending its output to the same webhook further confirms the intent to gather and exfiltrate environment data. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or notification, and the code lacks any validation or security controls around this data collection and transmission. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated environment variable collection and exfiltration to hardcoded external endpoints without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
