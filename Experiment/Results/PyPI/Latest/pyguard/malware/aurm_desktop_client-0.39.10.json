      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PreferredSettings) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This means that every time the user opens a new shell session, the downloaded script will be executed automatically without user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation and persistently executed on shell startup. The code lacks any validation, integrity checks, or user interaction, and the remote script could contain any malicious payload. The silent network retrieval and persistent execution of remote code during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is consistent with known malware patterns involving remote code execution, persistence, and stealth. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
