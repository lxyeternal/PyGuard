      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup phase that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, makes it executable, and runs it in the background with nohup. This behavior occurs without any user interaction or consent and is triggered automatically unless the environment variable 'X' is set to 'True'. Such automatic downloading and execution of a remote binary during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, often used in supply chain attacks to deliver and execute arbitrary payloads on the victim's system. The use of a raw IP address instead of a legitimate domain, the lack of validation or integrity checks, and the silent background execution further confirm the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses os.system to execute a shell command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, then changes its permissions to executable, and finally runs it in the background with nohup. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted, hardcoded external IP and executing it without any user interaction or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. It enables remote code execution of potentially harmful payloads, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment. The absence of any legitimate context, user consent, or integrity checks, combined with direct execution of a remote binary, strongly indicates malicious intent."
