      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It hooks into the setuptools installation process via a custom install command class, which triggers execution of code during package installation without user interaction or consent. The exec_command function collects sensitive system information by retrieving the current username and running the 'id' shell command, then enumerates the directory tree of the /etc/ directory, which contains critical system configuration files. The collected information is base64-encoded (a common obfuscation technique) and sent via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) at a randomized path. This sequence of environment discovery, data collection, obfuscation, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying this behavior. The use of base64 encoding to hide the data being sent and the automatic execution during install time further confirm malicious intent."
