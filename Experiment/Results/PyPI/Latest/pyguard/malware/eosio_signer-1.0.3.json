      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It collects system information by running shell commands ('hostname', 'whoami', 'ifconfig') and appends environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA) to a temporary file in /tmp/r. Then, it silently exfiltrates this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://61.28.229.27) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is embedded in the installation process to gather and leak sensitive system and environment information. The use of shell commands to gather host and user info, writing to a temporary file, and immediate network exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the hardcoded external IP address is suspicious. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration during package installation, use of environment variables for sensitive data, and network communication to a non-standard external endpoint."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes shell commands to collect sensitive system information: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it uses the requests library to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file without any user interaction or consent. This sequence of gathering host identity and network configuration data and exfiltrating it to a remote server is a classic hallmark of malicious data exfiltration behavior. The code does this automatically upon instantiation of the EOSIOKey class, indicating it is designed to silently collect and leak sensitive environment information. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification around this activity, and the hardcoded external IP address strongly suggests attacker-controlled infrastructure. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent."
