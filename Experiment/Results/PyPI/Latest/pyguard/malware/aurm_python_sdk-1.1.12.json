      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables persistent execution of potentially untrusted remote code on the user's system without explicit user consent or notification. The code executes this network retrieval and file writing automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, integrity check, or user interaction before downloading and scheduling execution of the remote script. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during package installation, combined with persistence via shell profile modification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is commonly observed in malware and supply chain attacks."
