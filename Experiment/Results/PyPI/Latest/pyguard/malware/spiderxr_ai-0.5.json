      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external API calls without explicit user consent or notification. It then sends this sensitive information, combined with user input and responses from a remote server, to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating user data to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. Additionally, the code makes multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) with custom headers mimicking a mobile app, which may be used for further data collection or command and control. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID used for silent data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or consent mechanism, and the data exfiltration is automated and covert. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns of information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration."
