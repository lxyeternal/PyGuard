      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes an arbitrary executable file ('your_executable.exe') during the package installation process by calling subprocess.run() inside the setup script. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically on user systems during package installation without user interaction or consent. The execution of an .exe file bundled inside the package at install time is suspicious and can be used to deliver and run malware payloads. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this immediate execution. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware and supply chain compromise, as they enable attackers to run arbitrary code on victim machines under the guise of a trusted package installation."
