      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
