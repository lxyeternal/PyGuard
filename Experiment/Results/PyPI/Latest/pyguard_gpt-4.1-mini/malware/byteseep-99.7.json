      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a known high-risk and critical pattern commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The dynamic import and execution of code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing code on install time from an external module is a classic vector for malware. Therefore, this code is considered malicious based on the critical risk pattern of arbitrary code execution during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to legitimate or known services. The URLs appear to be related to OAST (Out-Of-Band Application Security Testing) domains, which are often used for detecting data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code generates a random number to append to the URL path, likely to evade simple detection or caching. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the data sent includes system-specific identifiers, which is a common fingerprinting and data exfiltration technique used by malware. The absence of error handling beyond logging and the use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with known patterns of information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
