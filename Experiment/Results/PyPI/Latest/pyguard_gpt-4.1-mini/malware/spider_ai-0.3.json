      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple functions that send user-provided text and API keys to hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) on non-standard ports (8909, 4556) with suspicious headers including a non-standard Host header referencing a replit.dev subdomain. The use of hardcoded IP addresses instead of domain names, combined with custom headers and no user consent or authentication, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The functions spider_ai, Devils_GPT, and Worm_GPT all perform HTTP GET requests to these suspicious endpoints, potentially exfiltrating user input and API keys. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these network calls. The code lacks error logging and silently suppresses exceptions, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded external IPs and domains unrelated to any known legitimate service, combined with sending potentially sensitive data (API keys) to these endpoints, aligns with typical malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
