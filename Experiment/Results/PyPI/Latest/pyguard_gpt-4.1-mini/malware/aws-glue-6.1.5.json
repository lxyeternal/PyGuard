      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a custom PostInstallCommand class that overrides the setuptools install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain pov.sh is not a standard or trusted Python package source, and the code lacks any legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. The use of a post-install hook to execute network requests is a common technique for remote code execution or data exfiltration in malicious packages. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and unauthorized network communication during installation."

The domain 'pov.sh' on a non-standard port and the endpoint path suggest a potential command-and-control or data exfiltration server rather than a legitimate API. This pattern of silent network communication to a suspicious external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors that perform unauthorized data transmission or remote control. There is no benign application logic, error handling, or user notification surrounding this network activity, increasing the suspicion. Therefore, this code snippet exhibits malicious behavior."
