      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected code, which decrypts and executes the payload at runtime. Such obfuscation is often used to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized code execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of encrypted payload execution, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated, compressed payloads without user consent or transparency. This technique is a well-known vector for malware delivery, evasion of static analysis, and unauthorized system compromise."
