      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior embedded within an otherwise benign-looking color formatting utility. Specifically, it attempts to silently collect and exfiltrate sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop application's data folder without user consent or notification. It does this by: 1) Accessing the current Windows username via environment variables and constructing a path to the Telegram Desktop 'tdata' folder, which contains sensitive Telegram user data. 2) Compressing this folder into a ZIP archive while excluding cache and temporary files. 3) Uploading the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot API key and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating the user's Telegram data to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. 4) Running this backup and exfiltration process silently in a background thread triggered whenever color formatting functions are called, without any user interaction or consent. 5) Suppressing all exceptions to avoid detection or error reporting. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded credentials and endpoints, targeting sensitive user directories, silent background execution, and self-deleting of temporary files to evade forensic analysis. The presence of this hidden data theft functionality within a utility library is a strong indicator of malicious intent and abuse of trust."
