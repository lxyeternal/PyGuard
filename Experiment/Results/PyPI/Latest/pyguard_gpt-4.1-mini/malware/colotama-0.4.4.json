      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command subclassing setuptools' install class, which executes a post-install function _post_install. This function runs a shell command that executes a file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory using the current Python interpreter. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution immediately after package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing arbitrary code during installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious activity. The code uses subprocess.call with shell=True to run the command, which can be abused for command injection or running malicious payloads. There is no validation, user notification, or error handling around this execution. The package name and author information do not provide any indication of legitimacy, and the post-install execution of a script named 'colotama' is suspicious. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including arbitrary code execution during install, use of shell commands without validation, and lack of user consent or transparency. Therefore, this code is malicious."
