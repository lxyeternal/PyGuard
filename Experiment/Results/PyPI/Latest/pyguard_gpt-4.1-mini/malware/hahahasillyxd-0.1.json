      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads an MP3 file from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN using a PowerShell curl command. It saves this file as 'b.mp3' in the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. After verifying the file's existence, it immediately executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process command. This behavior constitutes arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external URL to download and run a file without validation or user notification, combined with execution during install time, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including remote payload retrieval, execution without consent, and abuse of the installation process for code execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this behavior, and the file executed is an MP3 file which could be a disguised payload or used to trigger further malicious actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
