      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code at install time via setup.py install hooks is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the pattern of triggering code execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware, as attackers use this to run arbitrary payloads on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior due to its automatic execution of potentially arbitrary code during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names and subdomains, which are typical indicators of malicious command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code performs these network requests automatically upon execution without any user interaction or notification, which is a common trait of malware performing system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or spawn shells, the unsolicited collection and transmission of environment data to suspicious external servers strongly indicates malicious intent."
