      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (PreferredSettings) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) without any user consent or validation. Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, thereby establishing persistence to run this script on every new shell session. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary code fetched from an external source during package installation, without user interaction or transparency. The downloaded code is executed indirectly via shell startup, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch executable code, writing it to a hidden file, and modifying shell startup files for persistence are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is well-known for malware delivery, persistence, and remote code execution, and is not typical of benign package installation scripts."
