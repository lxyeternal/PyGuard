      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds a network communication to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) within a post-install hook of a Python package setup script. This URL is used to send system-specific information including the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via https://api.ipify.org) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration occurs automatically upon package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, further indicates that this is likely a test or malicious exfiltration endpoint rather than a legitimate service. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network activity, nor does it notify the user or require consent. Subclassing setuptools.command.install.install to run this code during installation is a known technique for executing malicious payloads in Python packages. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized data exfiltration triggered by package installation."
