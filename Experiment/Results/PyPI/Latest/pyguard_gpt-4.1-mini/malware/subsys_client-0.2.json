      "malicious_behavior": "The code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 decoding combined with dynamic execution (exec and compile) of the decoded payload, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes and executes code fetched from a hardcoded suspicious URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r). It attempts to execute this downloaded content without any user interaction or validation, indicating a remote code execution attempt. Furthermore, it tries to start a system command in a new thread without error handling, which is a common evasion technique. The use of localhost with a non-standard port for injection suggests a backdoor or local proxy for further malicious payloads. The entire pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution from network-fetched data, execution during package initialization, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
