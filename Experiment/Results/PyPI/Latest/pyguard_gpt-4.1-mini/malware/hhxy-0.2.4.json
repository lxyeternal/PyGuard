      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://hhxy01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/PFAI.sh) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then sets executable permissions on the downloaded script and immediately executes it. This pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution sequence, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The absence of error handling, logging, or user notification further increases suspicion. The use of subprocess to run shell commands on a downloaded script from an untrusted source is a critical risk and a common vector for malware delivery, persistence, or further compromise."
