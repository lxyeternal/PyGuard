      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (PreferredSettings) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, ensuring the script runs automatically on shell startup. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism and remote code execution vector embedded in a package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack pattern. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. There is no validation or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the downloaded content is executed automatically on shell startup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. These factors combined indicate malicious intent."
