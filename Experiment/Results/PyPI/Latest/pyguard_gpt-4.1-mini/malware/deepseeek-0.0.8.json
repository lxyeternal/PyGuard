      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as the user ID (via shell commands 'id' or 'whoami') and the system hostname, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eoyyiyqubj7mquj.m.pipedream.net). The use of a non-standard, obscure domain not associated with any legitimate service, combined with silent suppression of exceptions and no user interaction or consent, strongly indicates data exfiltration behavior. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors involving system fingerprinting and covert transmission of sensitive environment information to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, which further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
