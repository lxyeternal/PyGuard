      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects extensive system information including hostname, current working directory, username, OS type, and detailed system commands output (IP address, CPU info, memory, disk, network info) using subprocess calls. It then sends all this sensitive system data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://00ymg2fcpil5571bhtc00slwfnli98xx.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of code during package installation, unsolicited collection of detailed system fingerprinting data, and exfiltration to a non-standard, suspicious external URL. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain for data exfiltration, combined with the absence of legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
