      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this collected sensitive environment and system data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of sensitive system and user information without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the absence of legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates this code is designed for covert information theft. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code executes during package installation to silently gather and leak environment details to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
