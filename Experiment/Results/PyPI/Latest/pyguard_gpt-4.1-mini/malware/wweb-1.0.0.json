      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup script requires 'fernet' and 'requests' modules, which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding this network or execution activity, and the payload is hidden behind encryption to evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
