      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is suspicious and can be abused to run malicious payloads. This pattern matches the known critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution triggered by setup.py install hooks, which is a common technique used by malicious Python packages to compromise systems during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints often used in security testing or malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the data sent includes user and system identifiers, which is a common pattern for system fingerprinting and information exfiltration. The use of random numbers in the URL path may be an attempt to evade detection or logging. The code performs this action immediately upon execution without any user interaction or validation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Although the code does not execute downloaded code or write files, the unsolicited collection and transmission of system information to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
