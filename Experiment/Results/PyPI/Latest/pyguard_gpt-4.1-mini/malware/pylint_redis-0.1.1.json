      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it as a query parameter to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL that is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime. The URL domain (decoded from base64) is suspicious and not a standard or known legitimate domain. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code performs an outbound HTTPS request to this external endpoint without any user interaction or consent, which is a typical behavior of data exfiltration or system fingerprinting malware. The SSL context is set to unverified, which disables certificate validation, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection or interception. The code then prints the response content, which could be a command or payload from a command-and-control server. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context surrounding this network activity. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically system fingerprinting and potential data exfiltration to a suspicious external server."
