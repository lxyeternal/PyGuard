      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes arbitrary code immediately after package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it dynamically imports and calls a function send_to_webhook() from the package's module akatest.send_webhook. This pattern of executing code during installation is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code triggers a network action (sending a webhook request) as a side effect of installation, which can be used for data exfiltration or remote signaling. The lack of user notification, the dynamic import during install, and the immediate network communication classify this as malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/7de0c331-90ee-4e2a-9edc-5e38790807ae/ImBad) using a subprocess call to curl without any user interaction or consent. The use of a webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, combined with the hardcoded endpoint and the lack of legitimate application logic or explanation, strongly indicates data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. This pattern aligns with typical malicious behavior involving hardcoded suspicious URLs and unsolicited network communication, which are key indicators of malware or data exfiltration attempts."
