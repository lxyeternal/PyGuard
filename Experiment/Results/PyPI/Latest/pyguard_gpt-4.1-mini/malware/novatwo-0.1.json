      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches content from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt) using the requests library without any user interaction or consent. It then base64-decodes a hardcoded ciphertext and uses a hardcoded cryptographic key with nacl.secret.SecretBox to decrypt the fetched content. The decrypted content is immediately executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution from a remote source. This pattern is a critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows an attacker to remotely deliver and execute arbitrary payloads on the victim's system. The execution occurs at import time of the setup module, which can be triggered during package installation, representing a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and encryption) to hide the payload and the lack of any validation, user notification, or error handling further confirm the malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this remote code execution in the setup script is a strong red flag for malware."
