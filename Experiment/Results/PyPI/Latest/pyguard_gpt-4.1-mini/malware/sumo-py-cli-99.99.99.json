      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system fingerprinting data without user consent or notification is a classic malicious behavior pattern. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, execution of shell commands during installation without user interaction, and immediate outbound network communication to a suspicious endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks where code executes during package installation to silently collect and leak sensitive environment information to an attacker-controlled server."
