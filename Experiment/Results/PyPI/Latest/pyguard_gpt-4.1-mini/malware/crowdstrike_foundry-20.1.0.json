      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that subclasses the setuptools install command to execute custom code immediately after installation. This custom code collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, OS details, and the absolute path of the script file, then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike). This behavior constitutes unsolicited data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL, automatic execution during package installation, and transmission of potentially sensitive system information to an external endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where code execution and data exfiltration occur during package installation, a critical risk behavior consistently associated with malware. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code triggers a network communication (send_data_to_webhook) immediately upon package import without any user interaction or consent. It collects system information (collect_system_info) and sends it to a webhook, which is a common pattern for data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as unsolicited collection of detailed OS information immediately followed by outbound network communication, use of hardcoded webhook URLs, and execution triggered as a side effect of package import (which can be exploited in supply chain attacks). The absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent, combined with immediate data exfiltration, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, OS details, and the absolute path of the running script, then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to an external endpoint without user interaction or consent, use of a hardcoded webhook URL that is not a standard or trusted domain, and immediate outbound network communication with potentially sensitive system details. Such patterns are strongly associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. Although the code does not perform obfuscation or dynamic code execution, the direct exfiltration of system information to a suspicious external URL without legitimate application context or user consent classifies this code as malicious."
