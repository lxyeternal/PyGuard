      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports a module named 'main' and immediately calls a function 'm()' from it. This means arbitrary code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is imported dynamically and not visible in the setup script itself. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key risk indicator here is the execution of arbitrary code during installation via a dynamic import and function call, which can be abused to run any malicious payload. Without the source of 'main.m()', the exact payload is unknown, but the pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its installation-time arbitrary code execution behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends all this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external HTTP endpoints. The URLs are obfuscated via Base64 encoding and decode to non-standard domains unrelated to any legitimate Python package or service. The code performs this data exfiltration silently without any user interaction, consent, or notification, and suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection. The combination of environment fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, and transmission to suspicious external servers is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance code preparing for further malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and potential command-and-control communication."
