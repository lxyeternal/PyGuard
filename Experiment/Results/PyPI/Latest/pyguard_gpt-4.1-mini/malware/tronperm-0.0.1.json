      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain (mockapi.io with a suspicious subdomain) for transmitting sensitive information (private_key) is typical of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another endpoint on the same suspicious domain and uses the response to control flow, which may be part of a command-and-control or remote control mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these network activities, and the function name and variable names do not clarify any benign purpose. These factors align with multiple key risk indicators and typical malicious patterns such as exfiltration of sensitive credentials to an external server without user knowledge."
