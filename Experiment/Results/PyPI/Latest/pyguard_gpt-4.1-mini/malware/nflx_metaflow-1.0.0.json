      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the public IP address (via an external service), the hostname, and the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080), which is not a standard or trusted domain. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Furthermore, this network communication occurs in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of environment discovery and immediate data exfiltration to a suspicious hardcoded IP address, without any legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."
