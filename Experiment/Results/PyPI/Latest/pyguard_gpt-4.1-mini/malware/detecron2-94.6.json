      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it runs the standard install routine and then imports and calls a main() function from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-install actions. However, there is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior. The install_requires dependencies (requests, psutil) are common libraries and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. The dynamic import of main and calling main() is from a local module, not from an external or untrusted source. Without the content of main.py, it is not possible to fully assess the behavior triggered post-install, but based on this setup.py alone, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior according to the provided knowledge points."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration in malware campaigns. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior, where sensitive system identifiers are collected and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration malware."
