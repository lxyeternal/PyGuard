      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://qpaw5pjg.requestrepo.com). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it executes code during package installation without user consent, collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to an untrusted external server. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain unrelated to the package's purpose, combined with the lack of user interaction or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector and is commonly associated with malware that performs system fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation."
