It uses multiprocessing to run multiple data collection modules concurrently, aggregates the collected data into a zip archive and preview, and then sends this data to configured senders. The naming conventions (e.g., MultistealerConfig, MemoryStorage, Features like passwords, cookies, cards, wallets) and the modules targeted (Chromium browsers, Discord, Telegram, Steam) strongly indicate credential and sensitive data theft. The code suppresses SSL verification (ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context), which is a common tactic to avoid SSL certificate validation errors during exfiltration. The absence of any user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic, combined with the automated collection and packaging of sensitive user data for transmission, matches multiple high-risk malicious behavior patterns such as credential theft, information stealing, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive user data from a Windows environment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code implements a protection module named Prtt designed to detect if the script is running in a virtual machine, debugging environment, or on certain restricted hosts/users/computers. It performs environment checks such as scanning running processes, checking MAC addresses, computer names, usernames, hosting status via an HTTP request, HTTP simulation detection, and virtual machine artifacts in the Windows registry and system files. The code uses standard libraries and Windows APIs to perform these checks and exits the program if any check returns true, effectively preventing execution in undesired environments. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, obfuscation, unauthorized network communication for data exfiltration, downloading or executing remote code, or persistence mechanisms. The network requests are limited to a configured IP URL and a synthetic HTTPS URL for environment detection, not for malicious payload delivery or data exfiltration. Exception handling suppresses errors but does not hide malicious activity. The code is well-documented and structured for legitimate anti-debugging and anti-VM protection purposes. Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided knowledge points, this code does not contain malicious behavior."

This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior because it enables remote payload retrieval and execution, which are foundational steps in many malware infection chains. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs the downloaded file in a new console window with the window hidden (SW_HIDE), a known stealth technique to avoid user awareness. There is no validation or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the URL is hardcoded externally via the class constructor, which could be set to a malicious endpoint. The combination of downloading an executable and running it without user consent or verification is a strong indicator of malware or potentially unwanted program behavior."

These actions are typical of malware or potentially unwanted programs trying to evade detection by antivirus software and hide their presence on the system. The use of Popen to run a PowerShell command with hidden window flags to modify Windows Defender preferences without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

The paths and data targeted are typical of user credential and asset theft. The code collects environment variables such as USERPROFILE and SystemRoot, and user information, which are used to construct paths to sensitive data. The presence of wallet folder names and paths for multiple cryptocurrency wallets indicates intent to steal cryptocurrency-related data. The inclusion of suspicious IP URLs (e.g., ipinfo.io/json and ip-api.com) for system information gathering suggests data exfiltration. The code also includes lists of MAC addresses, computer names, usernames, and running tasks that are commonly used for environment fingerprinting and anti-analysis checks, which are typical in malware to evade detection or avoid running in virtualized or sandboxed environments. The presence of a Startup folder path for persistence (AStConfig) indicates an attempt to maintain execution across reboots. Although the code snippet does not show actual network communication or data exfiltration functions, the configuration and data targeted, combined with the typical malicious patterns described in the knowledge points, strongly indicate that this code is part of a larger malware or stealer framework designed to harvest sensitive user data and maintain persistence. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

Valid tokens and associated user data (username, email, phone, bio) are collected and stored in a local file named 'Tokens.txt'. The code runs these token checks in background threads without user interaction or consent, silently suppressing exceptions to avoid detection. This behavior aligns with credential theft and data exfiltration patterns commonly seen in malware. The use of a suspicious hardcoded external URL, automated token harvesting from local files, and silent network communication without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent."

The run method disables SSL verification (ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context), which is a common evasion technique to avoid SSL certificate validation and detection. It uses multiprocessing Pool to run functions from the imported suspicious modules, collects files and fields from the results, creates a zip archive and a preview, and then sends this data via the Telegram sender. The entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors and making detection harder. The behavior matches typical malicious patterns: no user interaction, hardcoded external communication credentials, data collection and packaging, and exfiltration to a remote endpoint (Telegram bot). The use of a Telegram bot token for data exfiltration is a known malware technique. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of an information stealer or spyware targeting macOS systems."
