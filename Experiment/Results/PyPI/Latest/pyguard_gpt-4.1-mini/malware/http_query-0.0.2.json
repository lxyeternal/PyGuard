      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials), extracting sensitive information such as 'aws_access_key_id' and 'aws_secret_access_key' from all sections. It then sends this sensitive credential data via an HTTP POST request to an external endpoint specified by the environment variable 'WEB_HOOK'. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent or notification. The use of an environment variable to specify the webhook URL, combined with immediate data exfiltration, is a classic pattern of malicious code designed to steal credentials. Additionally, the code performs this exfiltration silently before proceeding with other network activity, which further indicates malicious intent."
