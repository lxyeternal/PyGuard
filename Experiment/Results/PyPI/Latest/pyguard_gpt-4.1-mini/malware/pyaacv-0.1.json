      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly into the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern of downloading and executing an external executable during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the execution is done silently without any safeguards. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands that download and run an executable is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior. This code effectively enables remote code execution on the victim's machine triggered by a seemingly benign package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
