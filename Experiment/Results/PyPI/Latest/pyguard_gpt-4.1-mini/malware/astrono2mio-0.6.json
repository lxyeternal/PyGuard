      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of base64 decoding and string encoding, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. It performs environment checks to detect debugging or analysis environments and attempts to evade execution if such conditions are met. The core payload is encrypted and compressed, then decrypted and decompressed at runtime using cryptographic primitives (AES and ChaCha20) and lzma, followed by execution via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution. This dynamic execution of hidden payloads is a hallmark of malware. The code forcibly exits if the environment is not Windows, indicating targeted malicious activity. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, suppression of exceptions, and execution of decrypted code during installation without user consent further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a concealed payload during package installation, consistent with supply chain malware and arbitrary code execution attacks."
