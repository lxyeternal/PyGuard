      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and the current package/module name, then constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string that resolves to a suspicious external domain (https://6fdfcce6.0wn.sh). It appends the hostname and package name as query parameters and makes an HTTPS request to this external URL using an unverified SSL context (disabling certificate verification). This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to a potentially attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, the lack of user interaction or consent, and the transmission of environment-specific information to a non-standard, suspicious domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the domain used is not a known trusted or corporate endpoint. Therefore, this code exhibits characteristics typical of malware performing environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration."
