      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a call to exec() on data that is first decompressed using zlib and then base64 decoded. This pattern is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious intent because it allows arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated payload. The payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent. This technique is commonly used in supply chain attacks and malware to hide the true behavior of the code and evade static analysis. The presence of such obfuscated dynamic code execution in a setup.py context is a critical risk and strongly suggests the code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a well-known malicious pattern: it imports base64 and zlib modules dynamically, decompresses a large compressed byte string using zlib.decompress, then decodes it with base64.b64decode, and finally executes the resulting code with exec(). This technique is a classic obfuscation and evasion method used by malware authors to hide the true payload and bypass static analysis. The use of exec on decompressed and decoded data is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to conceal and dynamically execute malicious payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. There is no indication of legitimate application logic, user interaction, or safe handling, and the entire code is designed to hide its intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This technique is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it obfuscates the payload, bypasses static analysis, and allows arbitrary code execution. Such behavior is consistently associated with malware, as attackers use it to hide and dynamically execute harmful payloads, often leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, combined with the use of exec on decompressed and decoded data, confirms that this code is malicious."
