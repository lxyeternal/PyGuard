      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it as a query parameter to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL that is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime. The URL domain (decoded from base64) is suspicious and not a standard or well-known domain, indicating potential external communication to an untrusted endpoint. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code performs this network communication without any user interaction or consent, which is a typical characteristic of malicious behavior. Although the code only prints the response content, the act of sending system-specific information (hostname) to an external, suspicious server is a form of information exfiltration and system fingerprinting, which is a hallmark of malware. The use of an unverified SSL context further suggests an attempt to bypass SSL certificate validation, which is suspicious. Overall, this pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors involving environment discovery and data exfiltration to a suspicious external server."
