      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected code, which hides the actual logic and payload inside encrypted blobs that are decrypted and executed at runtime. Such obfuscation is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis and detection. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of encrypted payload execution, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources without user consent or transparency. This aligns with multiple critical risk patterns such as dynamic code execution from compressed/encrypted payloads, evasion of static detection, and potential for further payload delivery or persistence. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious."
