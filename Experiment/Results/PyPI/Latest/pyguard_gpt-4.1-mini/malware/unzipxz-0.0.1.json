      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded, base64-encoded URL that decodes to a Discord webhook URL, which is a suspicious and non-standard endpoint for typical application use. The function 'h' immediately performs an HTTP POST request to this decoded URL with arbitrary data, without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The presence of the 'requests' library used solely to send data to this hardcoded external webhook strongly indicates data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. There is no benign context or explanation for this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded suspicious URLs, obfuscation, and unsolicited network communication. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
