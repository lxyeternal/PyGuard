      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a large hardcoded encrypted payload (encrypted_codes) which is decrypted by brute forcing a numeric key starting from 0. The Decryptor class uses AES decryption with a key derived from the password guess. Once decrypted, the code is decoded to a string and executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting an embedded payload and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and bypasses static analysis. The brute force approach to find the decryption key suggests an attempt to evade detection by not hardcoding the key directly. The final exec() call runs the decrypted code without any user interaction or validation, which is a critical risk behavior consistent with malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
