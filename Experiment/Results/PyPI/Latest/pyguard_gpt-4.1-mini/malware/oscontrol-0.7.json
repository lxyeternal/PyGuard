      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and wrapping them in a runtime loader. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is typical of code that decrypts and executes hidden payloads at runtime. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of encrypted payloads executed dynamically, this strongly indicates malicious intent or at least behavior consistent with malware. Such obfuscation is a known tactic to evade static analysis and hide malicious payloads, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. Without explicit user consent or transparency, this code is considered malicious."
