      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them as JSON data to a hardcoded external Google Chat webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for outbound network communication to an external service, combined with the immediate sending of environment variables, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the subprocess call to 'printenv' to retrieve environment variables and sending that output externally further confirms data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, and it matches multiple key risk indicators for malicious code, including unauthorized environment data collection and exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint."
