      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds a network communication to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) within the post-installation process of a Python package. It collects system-specific information such as the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via https://api.ipify.org) without any user interaction or consent, and sends this data to the external webhook. This pattern is a classic indicator of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The code executes this behavior automatically during the package installation by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the run method to call the send() function. This use of a post-install hook to silently exfiltrate system information to a hardcoded external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this network activity, and the external URL is unrelated to any known package repository or trusted service."
