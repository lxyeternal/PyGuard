      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during package setup without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it checks an environment variable 'X' and if not set to 'True', it runs a bash command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63), makes it executable, and runs it in the background using nohup. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: it downloads and executes potentially untrusted code from an external source during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a legitimate domain, lack of validation or user notification, and execution of the downloaded file without transparency or error handling further confirm the malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, unsupervised download and execution of remote payloads, and abuse of the package setup process for malware delivery."

This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior involving remote payload retrieval and execution. The use of a direct IP address instead of a legitimate domain, lack of validation or integrity checks on the downloaded file, and immediate execution of the file strongly suggest a malware delivery mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network and execution activity, which further confirms the malicious intent."
