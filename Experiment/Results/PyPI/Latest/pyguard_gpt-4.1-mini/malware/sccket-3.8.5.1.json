      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID to send data externally without user consent. The function unknown2() recursively enumerates all files in the current directory (excluding .zip files) and sends each file to a remote Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API using send_to_telegram(). This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration. The code also collects the hostname and IP address of the machine and sends a notification message to the same Telegram chat, which is typical of system fingerprinting and remote monitoring. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these network actions. The use of hardcoded external endpoints (Telegram bot API with a specific token and chat ID) for sending arbitrary files and system information is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code effectively acts as a data stealer, exfiltrating files and system info to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns such as unsolicited data exfiltration, environment fingerprinting, use of hardcoded external URLs, and absence of user notification or consent."
