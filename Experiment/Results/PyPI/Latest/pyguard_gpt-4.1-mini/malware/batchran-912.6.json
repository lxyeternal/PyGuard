      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During installation, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during the install phase is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() in the install hook is suspicious because it can run any code, including payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration, without explicit user approval. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of main.main(), the pattern of executing code at install time via a custom install command is a critical risk indicator for malware. This behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of abusing Python package installation to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to system compromise or further payload deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in malicious activities. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. The random number appended to the URL path suggests an attempt to evade caching or detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data transmission to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
