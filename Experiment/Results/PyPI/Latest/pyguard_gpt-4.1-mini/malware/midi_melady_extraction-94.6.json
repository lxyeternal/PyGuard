      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of code during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially since the actual payload is hidden in the 'main' module, which is not shown here. This pattern enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or exfiltration infrastructure, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware."
