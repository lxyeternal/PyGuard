      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It imports the 'requests' module and contains several hardcoded, base64-encoded URLs that decode to Discord webhook endpoints, which are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate application purpose. The function '__exfil__' sends collected data payloads via HTTP POST requests to these external webhook URLs, indicating data exfiltration. The data exfiltrated includes detailed system information (__sys__ function), Discord tokens (__dscan__), browser stored passwords (__browser__), and Minecraft account credentials (__mc__). These functions collect sensitive user and system data without user consent or interaction. The exfiltration is triggered in the 'SetTerminalColor' function, which calls '__exfil__' with these sensitive data payloads. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding of URLs and indirect function calls to hide its intent. The presence of environment discovery, credential harvesting, and immediate outbound network communication to suspicious endpoints is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic justifying these actions, no user consent, and no error handling to prevent detection. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive user data and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers."
