      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) on port 8867. The payload duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history logging, and spawns a bash shell, effectively granting remote command execution on the victim machine. The reverse shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command using os.system. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, as it triggers unauthorized remote access without user consent during package installation, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded suspicious IP and port, and executes shell commands to spawn a remote shell. Such code is commonly used in supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). Therefore, this code is malicious."
