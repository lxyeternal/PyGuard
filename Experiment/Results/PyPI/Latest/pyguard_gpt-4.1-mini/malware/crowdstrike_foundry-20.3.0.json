      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, fully qualified domain name, OS details, Python version, installed path, current working directory, and a timestamp without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike), which is a suspicious and non-standard domain used for capturing webhooks and often abused for data exfiltration. The behavior matches a classic pattern of system fingerprinting and unsolicited data exfiltration to an external endpoint. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and exceptions are silently suppressed, which further indicates an attempt to evade detection. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong indicator of malicious activity, specifically information-stealing or staging malware that profiles the host environment and exfiltrates data to a remote server."
