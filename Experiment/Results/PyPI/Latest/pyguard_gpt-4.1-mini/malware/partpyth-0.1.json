      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious URL on GitHub (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly to the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern of downloading and executing an external executable during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the execution happens silently as part of the install process. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands that download and run an executable is a critical risk indicator. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
