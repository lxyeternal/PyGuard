      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, ensuring the script runs automatically on new shell sessions. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism and remote code execution vector embedded in a package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack pattern. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification about the downloaded code. The downloaded script is executed indirectly on shell startup, enabling arbitrary code execution from a remote source. These factors combined indicate a high risk of malicious intent, as the package installation triggers remote code retrieval and persistent execution without user consent or transparency."
