      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification around this behavior. This matches multiple high and critical risk indicators such as code execution during install, obfuscated payload, use of cryptography with hardcoded keys, and execution of decrypted code via exec(). Therefore, this code is malicious."
