      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in a Python package setup script that executes immediately after installation without user interaction or consent. It collects sensitive environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), executes shell commands to gather system information (hostname, current user, network configuration), writes this data along with the environment variables to a temporary file (/tmp/r), and then exfiltrates this file via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, system information gathering, file writing, and immediate network exfiltration during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The use of os.system to run shell commands and curl for data exfiltration without any user notification or legitimate application logic further confirms the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes the following suspicious actions without any user interaction or consent: it runs shell commands to collect system information (hostname, current user, and network configuration) and writes the output to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Then, it performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file. This sequence is a classic example of unauthorized data exfiltration, where sensitive host environment details are gathered and sent to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of hardcoded IP, absence of legitimate application logic around this network activity, and lack of user notification or consent strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling for EOSIO keys, which is legitimate functionality, but the embedded data exfiltration in the constructor is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
