      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an obfuscated, base64-encoded URL that decodes to 'https://6fdfcce6.0wn.sh'. The domain '0wn.sh' is a known dynamic DNS service often used in malicious contexts, and the use of base64 encoding to hide the URL indicates an attempt to evade casual inspection. The code sends system-specific information (hostname) to an external, suspicious domain without any user interaction or consent. This behavior aligns with typical malware patterns involving system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform further actions, the unsolicited collection and transmission of system information to a suspicious external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
