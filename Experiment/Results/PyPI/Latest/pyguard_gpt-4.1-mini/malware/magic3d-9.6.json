      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is strongly associated with malicious activity, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. The presence of dynamic import and execution in the install hook, combined with no visible legitimate application logic or user prompts, indicates a high risk of malicious intent. Although the setup script itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the immediate execution of external code during installation is a critical risk pattern commonly used by malware to deliver payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or tracking, which is commonly abused by malware for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting malware behavior, where environment data is collected and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent."
