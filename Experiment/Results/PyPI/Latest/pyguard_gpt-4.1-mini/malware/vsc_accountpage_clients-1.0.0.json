      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://burpcollaborator.net). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a suspicious external domain (burpcollaborator.net, commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused in security attacks) for exfiltrating system information is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code leverages the installation hook to perform network communication and data exfiltration, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive system identifiers. Based on the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration triggered during package installation."
