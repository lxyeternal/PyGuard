      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports a module named 'main' and immediately calls a function 'm()' from it. This means arbitrary code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their usage is not shown here. The dynamic import and execution of code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables attackers to run arbitrary payloads on the victim's system during a trusted operation. This pattern is well-known to be associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems. Without the source of 'main.m()', the exact payload is unknown, but the installation hook itself is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends all this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external HTTP endpoints. The URLs are obfuscated via Base64 encoding and decode to non-standard domains unrelated to any legitimate Python package or service. The code performs this data exfiltration silently without any user interaction, consent, or notification, and suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection. The combination of environment fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, and transmission to suspicious external servers is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance code preparing for further malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system profiling for potential compromise."
