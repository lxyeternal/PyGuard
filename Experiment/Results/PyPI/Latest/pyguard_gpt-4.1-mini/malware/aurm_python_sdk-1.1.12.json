      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network communication during the package installation process without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. Specifically, it downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to modify user shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) to append a command that executes this downloaded script on every new shell session. This behavior enables persistent execution of potentially untrusted code fetched from the internet, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection, and does not validate or notify the user about the downloaded content. Executing remote code automatically during package installation and establishing persistence via shell profile modification are hallmark techniques of malware and supply chain attacks."
