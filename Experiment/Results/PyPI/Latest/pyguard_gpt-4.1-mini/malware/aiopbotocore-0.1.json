      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes network communication during the package installation process without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run a post-install hook that collects system information (hostname and OS) and the public IP address, then sends this data to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of code during package installation, exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to a suspicious hardcoded URL, absence of legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and no user notification or consent. The use of a webhook.site URL (a service commonly used for testing but also abused for data collection) further suggests data exfiltration intent. These factors collectively indicate a supply chain attack vector and malicious intent."
