      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it runs the standard install routine and then imports and calls a main() function from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-install actions. However, there is no evidence in this snippet of any obfuscation, network communication, shell command execution, or other suspicious behavior. The install_requires dependencies (requests, psutil) are common libraries and do not imply malicious intent by themselves. The dynamic import of main and calling main() is from a local module, which is typical in some packages to perform setup tasks or initialization. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to definitively rule out malicious behavior, but based on this code alone, it does not exhibit any of the typical malicious patterns such as arbitrary code execution during install, network exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious file operations. Therefore, this code is likely benign."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate services. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used for data exfiltration appear to be attacker-controlled and are not standard or trusted endpoints. The code silently suppresses any exceptions during network communication, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
