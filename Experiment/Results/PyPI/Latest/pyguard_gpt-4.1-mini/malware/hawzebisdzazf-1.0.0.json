      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://rqlzzdjnxe0zmyqf1ibj2sl4lvrpfh36.oastify.com). This behavior occurs automatically during the installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for data exfiltration, combined with execution during package installation, is a classic pattern of malicious activity often seen in supply chain attacks. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic related to the package functionality and instead focuses on environment fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
