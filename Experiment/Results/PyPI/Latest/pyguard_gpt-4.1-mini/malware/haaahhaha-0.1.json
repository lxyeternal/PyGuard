      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads an MP3 file from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN using a PowerShell curl command. It saves this file as 'b.mp3' in the current working directory without any user consent or validation. After successful download, it immediately executes the downloaded file using PowerShell's Start-Process command, again without user interaction or notification. This behavior constitutes arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch and run a file, combined with execution during install time without user consent, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including remote payload retrieval, execution of untrusted code, and abuse of the installation process for code execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions, and the file executed is not validated or sandboxed. Therefore, this code is malicious."
