This network activity occurs without any user interaction or consent and is embedded directly in the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The hardcoded webhook.site URL is a suspicious external endpoint commonly used for capturing data or exfiltration in testing or malicious contexts. There is no legitimate application logic or explanation for this network call in the setup script, indicating it is likely used for data exfiltration or tracking. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as unsolicited network communication during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of shell commands without validation or user notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
