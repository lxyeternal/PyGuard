      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools' install command, which executes automatically during package installation without user consent. It collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing but here indicates data exfiltration. Immediately after, it executes a hardcoded reverse shell command via subprocess.run, opening a bash interactive shell connected to a remote attacker-controlled server (electronics-affiliate.gl.at.ply.gg) on port 18666. This reverse shell enables unauthorized remote control of the victim's machine. The combination of environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration to a suspicious domain, execution of a reverse shell command during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), and lack of user interaction or notification are all hallmark indicators of malicious behavior. This code is a high-severity security threat and should be classified as malware."
