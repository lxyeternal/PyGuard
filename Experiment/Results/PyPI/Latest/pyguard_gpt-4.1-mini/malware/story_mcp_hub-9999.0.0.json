      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (58ba3l042cf1drkrg0cez303ruxlli97.oastify.com), which is not related to any legitimate package repository or service. This behavior occurs automatically during the installation process without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered during package installation, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call, and the package metadata (e.g., author='attacker', fake package name and version) further supports malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
