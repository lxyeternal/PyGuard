      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution as a side effect of package installation without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malicious payload deployment. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of external code during install is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially since the 'main' module is not part of standard package setup and could contain arbitrary harmful logic. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors of abusing the installation process for unauthorized code execution."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration testing. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern—environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints without user consent—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing or staging malware."
