      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes network communication during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to run a post-install hook that sends system-specific information (hostname and OS type) combined with the public IP address to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This is a classic pattern of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, automatic data collection, and immediate outbound HTTP requests during installation without transparency or user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the code is designed to stealthily exfiltrate system information to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
