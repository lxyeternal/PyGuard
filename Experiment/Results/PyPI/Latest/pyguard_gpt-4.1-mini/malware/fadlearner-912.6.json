      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code does not show any legitimate application logic or user notification around this execution, increasing suspicion. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time via a setup.py install hook is a critical risk indicator of malware, as attackers often use this to deliver payloads, establish persistence, or perform other malicious actions. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its automatic execution of external code during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band interaction testing or potentially attacker-controlled endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. The code performs network communication to these suspicious endpoints immediately upon execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically information gathering and exfiltration. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform further payload delivery, the unsolicited collection and transmission of system-specific data to hardcoded suspicious domains is a hallmark of reconnaissance or staging behavior in malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."
