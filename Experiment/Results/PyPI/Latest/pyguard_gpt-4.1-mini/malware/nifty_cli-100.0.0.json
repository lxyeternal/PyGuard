      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it embeds a hardcoded, obfuscated webhook URL that is decoded using a Caesar cipher and then contacted via an HTTP GET request during the package installation process. This network call sends the host user's environment information (username) and package name to an external endpoint without any user interaction or consent. The code hooks into the setuptools install command to trigger this network request automatically upon installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (Caesar cipher) to hide the webhook URL, the lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, and the automatic execution of this code during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with typical malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, stealthy environment fingerprinting, and unauthorized network communication embedded in install scripts."
