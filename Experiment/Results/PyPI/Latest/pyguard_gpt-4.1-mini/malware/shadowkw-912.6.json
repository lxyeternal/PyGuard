      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of dynamic import and execution during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to run unauthorized code on the victim's system. This technique can be used to deliver payloads, establish persistence, or perform other harmful actions stealthily as part of the installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in malicious activities. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this data collection and transmission. The code silently attempts to reach these URLs and logs the response or errors without notifying the user. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
