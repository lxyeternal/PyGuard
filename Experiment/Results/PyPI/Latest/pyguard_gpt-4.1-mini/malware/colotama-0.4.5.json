      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command subclassing setuptools' install command, which executes a post-install function. This function runs a shell command that executes a file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory using the current Python interpreter. The execution is done via subprocess.call with shell=True, which can run arbitrary code. This behavior triggers code execution immediately after package installation without user interaction or consent, a known supply chain attack vector. The code lacks any validation, error handling, or user notification around this execution. The use of a post-install hook to run an arbitrary script is a common pattern in malicious Python packages to execute payloads stealthily during installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this immediate execution of an installed file. Therefore, this pattern is strongly associated with malicious intent and is a critical risk indicator of malware."
