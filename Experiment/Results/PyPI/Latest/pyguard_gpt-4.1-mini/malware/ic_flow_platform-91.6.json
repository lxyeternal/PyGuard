      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends all this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration, combined with the hardcoded, non-standard, and suspicious domains strongly indicates data exfiltration behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity, including environment discovery, encoding of sensitive data, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints without user knowledge or consent."
