      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known high-risk and critical pattern commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since it bypasses normal user control and can be used to run arbitrary payloads. The presence of this pattern alone, given the extensive knowledge base, classifies the code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration in penetration testing and malware. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior with data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
