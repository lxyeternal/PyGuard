      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and appears to be generated by Pyarmor, a tool used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code logic, preventing static analysis and code review. Such obfuscation is commonly used by malware to conceal payloads, evade detection, and execute arbitrary code dynamically. The absence of any readable or legitimate application logic, combined with the use of encrypted payloads executed at runtime, aligns with critical risk patterns of malware delivery and execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
