      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. The function get_shell() creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (default 10.0.0.1) on port 4242 and then redirects the standard input, output, and error of a shell (/bin/sh) to this socket file descriptor. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, enabling remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain (av9f3cmae8dr818jkwjzemvek5qxen2c.oastify.com), which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used for command-and-control or data exfiltration. The request_url() call is made unconditionally at module level, meaning it executes immediately when the module is imported or run, without user interaction or validation. The presence of socket, subprocess, and requests modules used in this manner, combined with the reverse shell and network communication to suspicious external domains, matches multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including remote access trojans (RATs), unauthorized remote code execution, and potential data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these actions, no error handling or logging, and the code is structured to enable stealthy remote control. Therefore, this code is malicious."
