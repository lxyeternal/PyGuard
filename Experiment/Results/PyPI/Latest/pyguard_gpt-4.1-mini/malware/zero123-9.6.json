      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The code is embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a common tactic for malware to execute payloads during package installation. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity directly, the immediate execution of external code during installation without user awareness or validation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malicious packages. This pattern enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or notification."
