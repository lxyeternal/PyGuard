      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user consent or interaction, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity directly, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is a hallmark of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python packages. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its execution of arbitrary code during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 (a common obfuscation technique) and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to stealthily fingerprint the host system. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting for potentially unauthorized purposes."
