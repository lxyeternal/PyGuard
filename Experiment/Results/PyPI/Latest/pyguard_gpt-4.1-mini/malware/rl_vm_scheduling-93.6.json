      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named main and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the execution of arbitrary code during installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. This pattern enables attackers to run any code on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Therefore, this code is malicious due to its execution of arbitrary code at install time via a post-install hook."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern—environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints without user consent—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing or staging malware."
