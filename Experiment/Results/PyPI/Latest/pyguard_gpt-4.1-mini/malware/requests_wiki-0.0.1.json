      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including platform details, hostname, IP addresses, and username without user consent. It then immediately sends this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://38.181.219.70:5000/report), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication occurs automatically during the package setup process, meaning it triggers on installation without user interaction or notification, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, combined with the absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent. The package metadata and naming are generic and misleading, and the code comments even acknowledge the collection of sensitive data. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unsolicited data collection and exfiltration during package installation, making the code malicious."
