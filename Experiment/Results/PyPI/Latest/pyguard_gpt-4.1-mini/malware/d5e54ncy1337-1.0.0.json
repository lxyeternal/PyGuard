      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://ovnabqa0k6gt0vwzch7ovggkabg74xsm.oastify.com). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered during setup.py install, is a classic pattern of supply chain attack and malicious code injection. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call or data collection, and the code is embedded in the install hook, which is a known vector for malware to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information stealing and supply chain attack techniques."
