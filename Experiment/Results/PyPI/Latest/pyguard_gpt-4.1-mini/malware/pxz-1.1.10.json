      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time without explicit user consent. It then encodes and sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/), which is not a standard or trusted domain related to the package's stated purpose. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools' install command and overriding its run method to execute the data collection and transmission before proceeding with installation. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system information, use of hardcoded suspicious external IP, execution of network communication during install without user interaction or notification, and embedding of this logic in the setup/install script (a known supply chain attack vector). There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration, no user consent, and no transparency about the network activity. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
