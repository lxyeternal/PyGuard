      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external APIs, then sends this sensitive information to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID without any user consent or interaction. This behavior constitutes unsolicited data exfiltration. Additionally, the code makes HTTP requests to hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) with custom headers mimicking a mobile app, which may be command-and-control or data collection endpoints. The presence of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID used to send potentially sensitive user data externally is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this data collection and exfiltration. These factors align with typical malicious patterns such as unauthorized data harvesting and exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
