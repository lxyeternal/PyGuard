      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the public IP address, hostname, home directory, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, private IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication is embedded directly in the setup script, meaning it executes automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of os.popen to run 'curl' to obtain the public IP, combined with immediate outbound network communication to a hardcoded IP, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unsolicited system fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the endpoint is not a known or trusted domain. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package setup script."
