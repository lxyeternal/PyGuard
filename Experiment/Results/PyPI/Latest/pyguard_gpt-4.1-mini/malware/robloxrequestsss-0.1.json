      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external Dropbox URL without user interaction or consent. It saves this script with a suspicious filename ('634364.pyw') in the current working directory and then immediately executes it using 'pythonw.exe' via PowerShell commands. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary remote code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands that download and execute code from an untrusted external source, combined with the lack of validation, user notification, or error handling, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as executing shell commands during install, fetching and running remote code without consent, and embedding malicious payload delivery in the install process."
