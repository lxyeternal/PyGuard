      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the run() method. Inside run(), it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on the output of Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code via exec(), all without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
