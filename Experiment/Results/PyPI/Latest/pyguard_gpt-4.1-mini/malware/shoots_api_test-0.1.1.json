      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine using socket.gethostname() and then constructs a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string that resolves to a suspicious external domain (https://6fdfcce6.0wn.sh). It appends the hostname as a query parameter and makes an HTTPS request to this external URL using an unverified SSL context (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which disables certificate verification and is often used to evade detection or allow connections to malicious servers with invalid certificates. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique to evade casual inspection. The code sends potentially sensitive system information (hostname) to an external, non-standard domain without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of information exfiltration or system fingerprinting often seen in malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding this network activity, and the domain used is not a known trusted or corporate endpoint. These factors combined indicate that the code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration to a suspicious external server, which is a malicious behavior."
