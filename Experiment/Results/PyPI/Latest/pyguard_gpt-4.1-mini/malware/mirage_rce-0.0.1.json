      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it executes a reverse shell payload without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded IP address (124.221.70.199) on port 8876, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and spawns a bash shell. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, effectively hiding the payload in the install script. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, enabling unauthorized remote access to the victim's machine immediately upon package installation. The use of hardcoded external IP, execution of shell commands during install, base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, and spawning a remote shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent and align with multiple critical risk patterns for malware."
