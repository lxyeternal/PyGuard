      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It reconstructs an obfuscated Python script from a list of integers by subtracting 30 from each and converting to characters, then writes this decoded script to a temporary file '/tmp/xxx.py'. Immediately after, it executes this script via a shell command that runs 'python3 /tmp/xxx.py'. The use of obfuscated payload embedded in the install process, writing and executing a temporary script file, and running shell commands during installation are classic indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. The lack of any legitimate application logic, user interaction, or notification, combined with obfuscation and execution of a hidden payload, strongly indicates this code is malicious."
