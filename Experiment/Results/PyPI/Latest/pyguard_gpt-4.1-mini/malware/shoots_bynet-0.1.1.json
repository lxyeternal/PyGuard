      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it as a query parameter to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL that is base64-encoded and then decoded at runtime. The URL domain (decoded from base64) is '6fdfcce6.0wn.sh', which is a suspicious, non-standard domain not associated with legitimate applications. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The code makes an HTTPS request to this external domain without any user interaction or consent, sending potentially sensitive system information (hostname). The SSL context is set to unverified, which disables certificate validation, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection or interception. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. These factors align with typical malicious behavior patterns such as system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to a suspicious external server. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
