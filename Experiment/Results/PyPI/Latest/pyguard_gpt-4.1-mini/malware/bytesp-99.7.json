      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() in the install hook is suspicious because it can run any code, including payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration, without explicit user approval. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables attackers to run malicious payloads during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior due to its use of arbitrary code execution triggered by the installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and commonly associated with security testing or exfiltration endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited outbound network communication to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
