      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code, but even without decrypting it, the pattern of decrypting and executing code during install is a critical risk indicator of malware. This code abuses the installation process to run hidden, arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery."
