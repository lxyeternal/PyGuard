      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds malicious behavior by executing network communication during the package installation process without user consent. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command and runs a function 'send' immediately after installation. This function collects system-specific information such as the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'). It then constructs a URL containing this data and sends it as a GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a post-install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook.site URL for data exfiltration, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution of network requests during installation without legitimate application logic or transparency strongly indicate malicious intent."
