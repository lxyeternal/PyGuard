      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/). This behavior matches multiple key indicators of malicious activity, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system data to a suspicious hardcoded IP address. The immediate execution of this data collection and transmission upon import (without user notification or consent) further supports the classification as malicious. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this network communication, and the use of a raw IP address rather than a known, trusted domain is a common trait in malware for command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes."
