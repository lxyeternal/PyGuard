      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package installation process without explicit user consent or validation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, in the _post_install function, it calls subprocess.call with shell=True to run pip install for the 'pyprettifier' package and then executes a script or module named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. This dynamic execution of shell commands during installation is suspicious and can be abused to run arbitrary code on the user's system. The use of shell=True with formatted strings increases the risk of command injection or unintended execution. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions by writing ImportError messages to a temporary file without proper logging or user notification, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The pattern of executing shell commands in a post-install hook, especially installing additional packages and running code from the installed package directory, aligns with known malicious behaviors in supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
