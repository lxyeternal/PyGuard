      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior primarily because it executes a network exfiltration action immediately after package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to run a post-install hook that collects sensitive environment and system information, including the hostname, public IP address (fetched from an external service), and environment variables such as GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPOSITORY. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious ngrok-free.app domain, which is a non-standard, ephemeral tunneling service often abused for malicious purposes. The code disables SSL verification (verify=False), which is a common evasion technique. The use of dynamic import of 'requests' after installation, execution of shell commands (os.popen('hostname')), and immediate outbound network communication to a hardcoded external endpoint during installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators: execution of code during package installation, exfiltration of sensitive system and environment data, use of suspicious hardcoded external URLs, and absence of user consent or legitimate application logic justifying this network activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
