      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to execute additional code during package installation without user interaction or consent. After running the standard install process, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ovnabqa0k6gt0vwzch7ovggkabg74xsm.oastify.com), which is not a standard or trusted Python package source. This behavior matches multiple high and critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external endpoint, use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, and lack of user notification or consent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a package installation script."
