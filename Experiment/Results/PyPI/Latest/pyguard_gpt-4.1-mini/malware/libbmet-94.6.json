      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deliver and run malicious payloads on the victim's system. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of dynamic import and execution during installation is a hallmark of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python packages. The presence of this pattern alone is sufficient to classify the code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or exfiltration infrastructure, which is a known technique for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system identifiers without user consent to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
