      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, immediately after the package installation, runs an executable file ('your_executable.exe') located inside the installed package directory without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. The execution of an .exe file post-installation without validation, user notification, or error handling is highly suspicious and consistent with malicious patterns. Such post-install hooks that run executables can be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads on the victim's system. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, does not perform any integrity checks, and does not prompt the user, which aligns with known malicious tactics in Python package supply chain attacks."
