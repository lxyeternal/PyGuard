      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://gj8fxybp.requestrepo.com). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated with malware: it executes code during package installation without user consent, collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to an attacker-controlled domain. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external URL unrelated to the package's purpose, combined with the lack of user interaction or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a known vector for supply chain attacks and information stealing malware. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
