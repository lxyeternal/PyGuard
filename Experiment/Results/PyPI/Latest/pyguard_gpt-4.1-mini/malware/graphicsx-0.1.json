      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a lambda function to dynamically import 'zlib' and 'base64', then decodes a large base64-encoded string that is reversed, decompresses it using zlib, and immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of obfuscation—reversing, base64 decoding, and decompressing data before executing it—is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent. It is used to hide the true payload and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded and decompressed data is a critical red flag, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or transparency. Given the absence of any legitimate application logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the presence of heavy obfuscation and dynamic code execution, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
