      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes a main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The code is embedded in the setup.py installation process, which is a typical pattern for malicious packages aiming to execute payloads during package installation. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the immediate execution of external code during installation without user consent is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of Base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior used by malware to profile and exfiltrate host-specific data to attacker-controlled servers. There is no benign justification for this unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints."
