      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a known supply chain attack vector commonly used by malware to execute malicious payloads during package installation. The dynamic import and execution of code during installation, especially without validation or user notification, is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during setup/install is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names and subdomains, which are typical indicators of attacker-controlled command-and-control or data exfiltration servers. The code performs this network communication silently, without user interaction or notification, and uses randomized query parameters to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
