      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects system information including hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this sensitive environment data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party event collector often used for testing or malicious data exfiltration. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation, exfiltration of sensitive system information, use of hardcoded suspicious external endpoints, and lack of user interaction or legitimate application logic. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks related to the package but instead performs covert data collection and exfiltration, consistent with malicious intent and supply chain attack patterns."
