      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds network communication to an external, hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) within the post-installation process of a Python package. Specifically, it collects system information such as the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via https://api.ipify.org), concatenates these details, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to the external webhook without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious external URL in a setup.py install hook, combined with immediate outbound network communication of sensitive system identifiers, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this data exfiltration, and the code executes this as a side effect of installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware."
