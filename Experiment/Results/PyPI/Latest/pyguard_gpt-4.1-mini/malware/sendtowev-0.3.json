      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It performs extensive credential and sensitive data harvesting from various installed browsers and applications, including Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, credit card data, autofill data, browsing history, bookmarks, and cryptocurrency wallets. The code uses Windows-specific APIs to detect debugging tools and virtual machine environments, terminating execution if such environments are detected, which is a common anti-analysis technique. It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to achieve persistence. The code collects detailed user and system information, including IP address, username, and geolocation data, and formats this data for exfiltration. It exfiltrates stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and uploads files to an external file hosting service (gofile.io), sending the resulting URLs to the attacker. The code suppresses warnings and standard error output to avoid detection. It uses cryptographic functions to decrypt stored browser passwords and cookies, indicating intent to steal protected credentials. The use of obfuscated variable names, threading to evade detection, and multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is a credential stealer and data exfiltration malware targeting Windows systems."
