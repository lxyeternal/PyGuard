      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the current UTC timestamp, hostname, current user, external IP address (fetched from https://ident.me), and the absolute path of the script file. It then encodes this data using base32 encoding with a minor modification (replacing '=' with '0'), and computes an MD5 hash fingerprint of the encoded data. Subsequently, it constructs multiple subdomain strings by chunking the encoded data and appending the fingerprint and an index, forming domain names under the suspicious domain 'testpcurl.com'. For each constructed domain, it performs a DNS resolution attempt via socket.getaddrinfo, effectively sending DNS queries to an external domain controlled by a third party. This behavior is a classic example of covert data exfiltration via DNS tunneling or DNS-based beaconing, where sensitive system information is encoded and sent out without user consent or interaction. The domain 'testpcurl.com' is not a standard or known benign domain and is likely attacker-controlled. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including environment fingerprinting, data encoding, and covert exfiltration to suspicious external domains. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment and user information including the current UTC timestamp, hostname, username, external IP address (fetched from an external service), and the absolute path of the script file. It then encodes this data using base32 encoding with a slight obfuscation (replacing '=' with '0'), and generates an MD5 hash fingerprint of the encoded data. Subsequently, it constructs multiple subdomain strings by chunking the encoded data and appending the fingerprint and an index, forming domain names under a suspicious domain '3bf2562a.log.dnslog.sbs'. The code then performs DNS resolution (socket.getaddrinfo) on these constructed domain names, effectively sending the encoded system/user information out via DNS queries to a potentially attacker-controlled domain. This pattern is a classic example of covert data exfiltration using DNS tunneling or DNS-based beaconing, which is a known malicious technique to evade detection and exfiltrate sensitive information without direct HTTP or TCP connections. The absence of user interaction, the use of external IP retrieval, encoding and hashing of sensitive environment data, and the transmission of this data to a suspicious external domain strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."
