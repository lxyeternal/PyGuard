      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools install command to perform unauthorized actions during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, non-standard URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly to the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern of downloading and executing an external executable during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the execution is done silently without any user interaction. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing an external binary during install time is a critical risk indicator of malware. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system as a side effect of installing the package, which is a hallmark of malicious packages and supply chain attacks."
