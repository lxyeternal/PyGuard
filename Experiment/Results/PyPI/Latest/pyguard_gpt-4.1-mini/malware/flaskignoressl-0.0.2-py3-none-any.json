This behavior matches a classic data exfiltration pattern: reading potentially sensitive configuration data and transmitting it to an external, suspicious endpoint without user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and filename is an obfuscation technique commonly used in malware to evade detection. The hardcoded IP address and port, combined with the lack of legitimate application context or user notification, strongly indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration and is malicious."
