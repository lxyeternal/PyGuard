      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, it decodes base64-encoded strings that form the code 'import os' and then executes this decoded code dynamically using exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources. Furthermore, it constructs a string from hex-encoded byte values, decodes it, and then evaluates it with eval(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique enabling arbitrary code execution. The use of dynamic code execution (exec and eval) on decoded or reconstructed data without any user interaction or validation is a hallmark of malware. Although the rest of the code appears to generate Fibonacci sequences, this seems to be a decoy or filler to mask the malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying the dynamic execution of decoded strings in this context. Therefore, based on the presence of obfuscated payloads decoded and executed at runtime, the code is malicious."
