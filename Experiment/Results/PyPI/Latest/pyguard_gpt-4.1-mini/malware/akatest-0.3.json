      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/7de0c331-90ee-4e2a-9edc-5e38790807ae/ImBad) using a subprocess call to curl without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is a service commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, strongly suggests data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or explanation for this network activity, and it uses subprocess to execute an external command, which is a common pattern in malicious scripts for stealth or evasion. These factors align with multiple key risk indicators and typical characteristics of malicious code, including hardcoded external URLs, no user consent, and outbound network communication to suspicious endpoints."
