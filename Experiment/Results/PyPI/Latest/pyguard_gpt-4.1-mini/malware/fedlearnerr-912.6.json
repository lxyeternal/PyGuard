      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. The code does not provide any validation, logging, or transparency about what the main() function does, which raises suspicion. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to run payloads stealthily as part of the installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in security testing or malicious activity. The code performs this data exfiltration silently without user interaction or notification, and the random number appended to the URL path suggests an attempt to evade simple detection or caching. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this network communication. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, making this code malicious."
