      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and system data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system and user information without user consent or notification. The code executes this exfiltration automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data transmission, combined with the collection of detailed host fingerprinting information and lack of legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent."
