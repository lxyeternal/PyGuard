It then sends this sensitive token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log), which is unrelated to any legitimate application logic. This exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation (triggered immediately in setup.py) is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate business logic or user notification, uses a hardcoded suspicious domain for data exfiltration, and performs network communication during installation without consent. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, abuse of installation process, and use of suspicious external endpoints."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an access token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service at the internal IP 169.254.169.254, which is a sensitive endpoint providing credentials for the instance's default service account. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for sending sensitive tokens, combined with the lack of legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known indicators of malware that steal cloud instance credentials for unauthorized access or lateral movement."
