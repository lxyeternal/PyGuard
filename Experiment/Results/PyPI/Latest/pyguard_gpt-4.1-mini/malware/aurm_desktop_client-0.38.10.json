      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command for setuptools that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script automatically in the user's shell initialization files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior enables persistent execution of remote code without user consent or notification. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. The downloaded script is executed indirectly via shell command on each new shell session, which is a classic persistence and remote code execution technique. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector, abusing the package installation process to fetch and execute untrusted code, posing a critical security risk. The use of a hardcoded external URL, writing executable code to hidden user files, modifying shell startup files, and executing remote code without validation or user interaction are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
