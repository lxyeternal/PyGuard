      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds malicious behavior by overriding the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an MP3 file from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'b.mp3' in the current working directory. Immediately after a successful download, it uses PowerShell's Start-Process to open (execute) the downloaded file. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote file during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The use of hardcoded external URLs, execution of shell commands in install hooks, absence of user interaction or validation, and execution of downloaded content all strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of downloaded payloads without validation or user notification."
