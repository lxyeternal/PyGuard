      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code in 'main.main()' will run automatically and without user consent during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code at install time without explicit user interaction or notification is a well-known malicious behavior pattern. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of code during installation is a critical risk indicator for malware, as attackers often embed malicious payloads in such hooks to gain remote code execution on victim systems. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The URLs have unusual domain names that do not correspond to legitimate or known services, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code performs this network communication automatically on execution without any user interaction or notification. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data transmission to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior, and the use of randomized query parameters further suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking."
