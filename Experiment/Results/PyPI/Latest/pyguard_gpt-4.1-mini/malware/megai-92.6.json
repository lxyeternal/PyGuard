      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system as part of the package installation process. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the execution of code during install time without explicit user consent is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python packages. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its use of arbitrary code execution triggered by the package installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band interaction testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior used by malware to profile infected hosts and exfiltrate sensitive system identifiers to attacker-controlled servers. There is no benign justification for this unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints."
