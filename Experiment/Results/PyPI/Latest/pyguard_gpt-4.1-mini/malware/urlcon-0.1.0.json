      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string assigned to __safety_token__, which decodes to a Python expression that imports the 'urllib3' module, creates a PoolManager, and performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL 'https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z'. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide network communication to an external, non-standard URL. The code is designed to fetch data from an external source without user interaction or consent, which is a typical behavior of malware attempting to retrieve and possibly execute remote payloads. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the network request, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and immediately starts a new thread that executes code via exec(). The executed code is obtained by calling the function 't' on '__safety_token__', both imported from a relative module named '__version__'. This pattern of dynamically executing code in a separate thread without any user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec() on data that is likely obfuscated or encoded (given the naming '__safety_token__' and function 't') is a classic technique to hide and run arbitrary code, which can bypass static analysis and evade detection. The immediate spawning of a thread to run this exec() call further suggests an attempt to run malicious payload stealthily in the background. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent evident, and the code structure aligns with known malware patterns involving dynamic code execution and threading for evasion."
