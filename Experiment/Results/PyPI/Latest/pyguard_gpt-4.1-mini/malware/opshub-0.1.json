      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern in the Subsys.status method. Specifically, it uses dynamic imports and executes a base64-decoded payload via exec and compile. The decoded payload imports NamedTemporaryFile and executable from tempfile and sys modules, then performs a network request to a hardcoded IP address (http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/...), reads the response, writes it to a temporary file, executes it, and then closes the temporary file. This sequence is a classic indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery, which is a hallmark of malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution (exec), and fetching executable code from a suspicious hardcoded IP address without user consent or validation confirms malicious intent. The rest of the code appears benign and simulates subsystem management, but this embedded payload execution makes the entire module malicious."
