It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, private IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication is embedded directly in the setup script, causing the data collection and exfiltration to occur automatically during package installation or execution, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, combined with the unsolicited collection and transmission of potentially sensitive environment data, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including unsolicited data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and execution of network communication during package setup without user consent."
