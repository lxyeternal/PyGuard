      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment and system fingerprinting information without user consent or notification. The code executes this exfiltration automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of os.popen and os.system to run shell commands and curl, combined with the hardcoded external webhook URL, and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, data exfiltration, execution during install time, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints."
