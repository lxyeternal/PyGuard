      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named main and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code uses dynamic import and execution in the setup.py install hook, which can be abused to run arbitrary or malicious payloads on the victim's system during package installation. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the immediate execution of main() on install is suspicious and potentially dangerous, especially since the main module and function are not part of standard setuptools or the package metadata. This behavior fits the critical risk pattern of arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common malware technique in Python ecosystems."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled endpoints. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with exfiltration of sensitive system identifiers to hardcoded suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical applications, and the code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious endpoints without user consent."
