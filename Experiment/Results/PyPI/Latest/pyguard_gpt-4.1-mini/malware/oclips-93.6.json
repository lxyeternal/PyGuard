      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing code during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', libraries often used for network communication and system monitoring, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes in the 'main' module. Given these factors and the well-documented risks of code execution in setup/install scripts, this code should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent."
