      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command subclassing setuptools' install command, which executes a post-install function immediately after installation. This post-install function runs a shell command that executes a file named 'colotama' located inside the installed package directory, using the current Python interpreter. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution during package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The use of subprocess.call with shell=True to run a constructed command string further increases risk, as it can lead to command injection or execution of untrusted code. There is no validation, logging, or user notification around this execution. The package name and author information do not provide any indication of legitimacy, and the code does not perform any benign setup tasks such as compiling extensions or environment configuration. Overall, this pattern of executing a bundled script immediately upon installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors in Python packages."
