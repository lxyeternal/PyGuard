      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() in the install hook is suspicious because it can run any code, including malicious payloads, at install time. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables attackers to run arbitrary commands or payloads on the victim system during package installation. This behavior aligns with the known malicious pattern of code execution embedded in install scripts, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs contain non-standard domains and subdomains that resemble those used in testing or exploitation frameworks (e.g., oast domains used for out-of-band interaction detection). The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, which is a typical pattern of information gathering and exfiltration seen in malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior. The use of random numbers in the URL path may be an attempt to evade detection or logging. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
