      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code execution occurs automatically and silently during package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern of executing code at install time is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the use of dynamic import and immediate execution in the install hook is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. This behavior aligns with the knowledge points describing malicious code that triggers code execution as a side effect of package installation without user consent, a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration in security testing or malicious activity. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. The overall pattern—environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints without user consent—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
