      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is designed to collect detailed user and system information during the package installation process without explicit user consent and send it to a hardcoded external server (http://199.189.85.8:5000/collect). The collected data includes username, hostname, OS type and version, private IP, public IP, and approximate geolocation. This data collection and exfiltration happen automatically as a post-install hook in the setuptools installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Although the code explicitly states it does not collect passwords, it still gathers sensitive environment and network information and transmits it to a remote server, which is a privacy violation and potentially illegal without user authorization. The use of a hardcoded IP address and port for data exfiltration, combined with automatic execution during installation, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unauthorized data exfiltration, lack of user interaction or consent, and abuse of the package installation process for covert data collection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
