      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially since the 'main' module is not part of the standard setup process and could contain harmful payloads. This pattern aligns with the critical risk indicators for malicious code execution embedded in package setup scripts."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, which is typical of malware trying to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical applications."
