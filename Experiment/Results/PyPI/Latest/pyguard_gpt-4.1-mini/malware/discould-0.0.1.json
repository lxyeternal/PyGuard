      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (Anch.exe) from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It saves this executable in the current working directory and then immediately executes it silently using PowerShell. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and execute the file further supports this. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow evident, and the code lacks error handling or integrity checks on the downloaded file. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution from an untrusted source and is commonly used in malware infection chains."
