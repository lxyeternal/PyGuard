      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deploy malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. The code also imports 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their usage is not shown here. The presence of dynamic import and execution in the install hook, without any validation, logging, or user notification, is a hallmark of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating data exfiltration. The code silently suppresses exceptions during network communication, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The combination of environment discovery, encoding, and exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting for potential further exploitation."
