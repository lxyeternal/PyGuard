      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard URL with a random-looking subdomain under the domain 'oast.fun', which is known to be used for security testing and potentially malicious callback or exfiltration endpoints. There is no user interaction or consent before this network action. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or context explaining the purpose of this request. The domain and URL pattern strongly suggest it is used for data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking without user knowledge. This behavior aligns with multiple key risk indicators such as use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, no user notification, and network communication to a suspicious external endpoint, which are typical characteristics of malicious code."
