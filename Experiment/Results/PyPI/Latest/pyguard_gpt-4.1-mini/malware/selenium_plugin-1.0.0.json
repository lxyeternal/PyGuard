      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded external URL (https://store9.gofile.io/download/web/354c4da7-4bcb-4186-9d47-847d7a0553c2/folder.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It saves this ZIP file into a directory under the user's APPDATA path, extracts it there, searches for an executable (.exe) file, and then adds a registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to run this executable at user login. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain execution after reboot. The code suppresses exceptions silently in file deletion, does not validate the downloaded content, and uses a generic and misleading registry run key name \"Runtime Broker\" to disguise the persistence entry. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL to download an executable payload and the automatic setup of autostart without user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the code effectively downloads and installs an untrusted executable for persistent execution, which is a high-risk malware pattern."
