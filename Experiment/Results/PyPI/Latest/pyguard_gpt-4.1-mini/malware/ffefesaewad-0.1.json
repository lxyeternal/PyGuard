      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding to decode a string and then immediately executes it with exec(). This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the actual code being run, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded string is 'print(\"test\")', which itself is benign, but the pattern of base64 decoding followed by exec() is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources. Such a pattern is commonly used by malware to evade static analysis and hide malicious payloads. Even though the decoded payload here is harmless, the use of exec() on base64-decoded data is a hallmark of malicious behavior and should be treated as suspicious or malicious unless there is a clear, legitimate reason and context for this pattern."
