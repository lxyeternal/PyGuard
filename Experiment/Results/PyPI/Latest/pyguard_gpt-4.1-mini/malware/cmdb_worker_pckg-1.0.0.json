      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It collects the local system's hostname and username, concatenates them into a string, encodes this string in base64, and then constructs a DNS query using the encoded data as a subdomain of a suspicious external domain (tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun). This DNS query is executed via os.popen with nslookup, effectively exfiltrating system-specific information to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data, embedding this behavior in the install process (a known supply chain attack vector), and the use of a non-standard, suspicious domain for data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and it occurs silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware to evade detection."
