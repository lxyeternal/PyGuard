      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Although the code snippet itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is suspicious and can be abused to run malicious payloads. This pattern enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system as a side effect of installing the package, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
