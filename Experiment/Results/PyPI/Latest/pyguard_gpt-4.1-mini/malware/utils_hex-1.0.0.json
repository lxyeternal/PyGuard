      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple layers of encoded and compressed data that is dynamically decoded and executed at runtime. It uses indirect and dynamic attribute access, lambda functions, and encoded strings to hide its true intent. The code imports built-in functions and modules in an obfuscated manner, reconstructs strings from character codes, and executes dynamically generated code. The presence of a large encoded payload, combined with dynamic evaluation (eval/exec) of decompressed data, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are commonly used in malware to evade static analysis and execute arbitrary code fetched or embedded within the script. The code also references an external URL (https://pyobfuscate.com) in a suspicious context, which may be used for further payload retrieval or command and control. Overall, the obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, and encoded payload strongly suggest that this code is malicious."
