      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it. This means that arbitrary code in the 'main' module will be executed automatically during the package installation process without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code at install time via setup.py or setuptools install hooks is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The package name 'importlibs_resources' and version '95.6' appear generic and potentially designed to masquerade as a legitimate package. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries but can be abused for network communication and system information gathering. The code does not show the content of the 'main' module, but the pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware or supply chain attack. This behavior enables attackers to run arbitrary payloads on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Therefore, based on the known risk patterns and the code structure, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a common obfuscation technique in malware. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band interaction testing or attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior used by malware to exfiltrate sensitive system identifiers to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
