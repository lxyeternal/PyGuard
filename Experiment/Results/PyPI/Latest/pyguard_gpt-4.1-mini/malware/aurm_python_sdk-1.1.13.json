      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network request during the package installation process (in the overridden install command) to download a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') into common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) to ensure persistence, so that the downloaded script runs automatically in future shell sessions. This pattern of downloading and writing executable code from an external source during package installation, combined with modifying user shell configuration files to execute that code persistently, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection, and does not validate or notify the user about the downloaded content or its execution. There is no legitimate application logic justifying these actions, and the behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of remote code retrieval and persistence establishment during package installation."
