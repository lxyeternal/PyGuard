      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (34.30.170.63) on port 3000 without any user interaction or consent. It then enters an infinite loop where it receives data from the remote server, decodes it as a shell command, executes it on the local system using subprocess.check_output with shell=True, and sends back the command output to the server. This behavior is a classic pattern of a reverse shell or remote access trojan (RAT), enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the victim's machine. The code lacks any authentication, validation, or user notification, and directly executes arbitrary commands received from the network, which is a critical security risk and a hallmark of malicious activity."
