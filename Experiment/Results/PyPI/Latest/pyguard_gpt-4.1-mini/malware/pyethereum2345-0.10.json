      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects system information such as hostname and username without user consent. It then executes a shell command via subprocess to run a curl command that downloads a zip file from a suspicious external URL (hosted on gitlab.com but in a path unrelated to the package name) and saves it to a hardcoded path in the user's home directory (/home/kali/dependencyconfusion/dependency-confusion-expoit/python-rce/test.zip). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code or payloads are downloaded during package installation without validation or user notification. After that, it sends the collected system information (hostname, username, and the output of the curl command, which is likely empty or error) to a hardcoded external endpoint (https://eojs8k35b24avi1.m.pipedream.net), which is a known service used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, often abused by attackers for data exfiltration. The combination of executing shell commands during install, downloading potentially untrusted code to a sensitive user directory, collecting system information, and exfiltrating it to an external suspicious endpoint without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as code execution during install, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of error handling or user notification."
