      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install). During installation, it collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this collected sensitive environment and system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unsolicited data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for transmitting detailed host fingerprinting data during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code executes shell commands and network communication silently during install time, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation script."
