      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known high-risk and critical pattern commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. Although the code snippet itself does not show obfuscation, network communication, or direct payload delivery, the execution of arbitrary code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since the imported 'main' module is not part of standard or known benign setup scripts. This pattern enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of hardcoded, non-standard URLs strongly suggests command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. The combination of environment fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of malicious activity, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
