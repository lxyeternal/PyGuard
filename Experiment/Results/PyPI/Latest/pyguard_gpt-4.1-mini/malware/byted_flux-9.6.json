      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and immediate execution of code during installation can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Although the code itself does not show explicit network or file operations, the invocation of main() from an external module at install time is suspicious and fits the critical risk pattern of arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 (a common obfuscation technique) and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and the collection of detailed system fingerprinting data are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior. The code silently suppresses exceptions and does not provide any legitimate functionality or user notification, further increasing suspicion. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers and is malicious."
