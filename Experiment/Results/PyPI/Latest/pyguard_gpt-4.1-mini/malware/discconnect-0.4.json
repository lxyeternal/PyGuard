      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, upon package installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using the Windows API call WinExec without any user interaction, consent, validation, or integrity checks. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector and remote payload delivery mechanism, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL to fetch an executable, writing it to a user directory, and executing it silently during install is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network and execution activity, and the code suppresses detailed error handling, further increasing suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware, especially in Python package installation scripts."
