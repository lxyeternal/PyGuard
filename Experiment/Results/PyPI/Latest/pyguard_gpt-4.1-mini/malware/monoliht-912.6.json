      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it runs the standard install routine and then imports and calls a main() function from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-installation actions. However, the code itself does not show any obfuscation, network communication, shell command execution, or other suspicious behavior within the setup script. The import of 'main' and calling main() is a direct, non-obfuscated call to a presumably local module, which is a common pattern in some packages to perform setup tasks or initialization. There is no evidence in this snippet of malicious behavior such as arbitrary code execution from remote sources, data exfiltration, or stealth techniques. The presence of 'requests' in install_requires is not suspicious by itself. Without the content of the 'main' module, it is impossible to fully guarantee safety, but based on this code alone and the provided knowledge points, this setup.py script does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in security testing or malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. The code performs automated network communication to these suspicious endpoints, which is a hallmark of information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform further payload delivery, the unsolicited collection and exfiltration of environment and user data to hardcoded suspicious domains without user knowledge or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
