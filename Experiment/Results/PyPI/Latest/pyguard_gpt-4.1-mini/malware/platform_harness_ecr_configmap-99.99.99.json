      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and system data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or notification is a classic malicious behavior pattern. The code runs automatically during installation without user interaction, uses hardcoded external endpoints for data exfiltration, and collects potentially sensitive information that can be used for fingerprinting or further attacks. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including execution of network communication during install, exfiltration of sensitive host data, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of legitimate application logic justifying this behavior."
