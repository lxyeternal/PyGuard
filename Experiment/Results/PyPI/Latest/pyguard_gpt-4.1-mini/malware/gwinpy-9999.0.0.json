      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, DNS servers, root directory listing, and contents of /etc/passwd, which is sensitive information. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eowthx8teol6a3s.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is silent and exception-suppressed, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The code executes immediately during package installation (as indicated by the comment), which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors—unsolicited collection of sensitive system data and exfiltration to a suspicious external endpoint during installation—are classic hallmarks of malicious activity, specifically information-stealing malware or reconnaissance code used in attacks."
