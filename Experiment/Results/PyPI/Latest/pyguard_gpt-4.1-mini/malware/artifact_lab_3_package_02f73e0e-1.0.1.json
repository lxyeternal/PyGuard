This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration. The exfiltration is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a suspicious ngrok-free.app domain for data exfiltration further indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials or tokens. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
