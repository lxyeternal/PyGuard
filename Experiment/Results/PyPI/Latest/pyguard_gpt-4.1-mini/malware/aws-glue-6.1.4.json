      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain pov.sh is not a standard or trusted Python package source, and the request is made without any legitimate application logic or user notification. The code uses setuptools install subclassing to execute this network call during installation, enabling remote code execution or data exfiltration. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unsolicited network communication during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of code in install hooks without user consent."

The domain 'pov.sh' on a non-standard port and the endpoint path suggest a potential command-and-control or data exfiltration attempt. This pattern aligns with typical malicious behavior indicators such as use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, absence of legitimate context, and unsolicited network communication. There is no evidence of error handling, logging, or user notification, increasing suspicion. Although the code snippet is minimal, the presence of a direct network call to a suspicious external endpoint without context or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
