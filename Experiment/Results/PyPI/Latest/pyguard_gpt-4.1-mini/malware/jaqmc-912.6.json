      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named main and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and immediate execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the victim's system as part of the package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the main module or what main() does, the presence of this install-time code execution hook is a strong red flag. This behavior aligns with the knowledge points indicating that code execution triggered during package installation, especially via subclassing setuptools install commands and dynamic imports, is a hallmark of malicious packages and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and appear to be associated with out-of-band interaction testing or potentially malicious data collection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. The code performs network communication to these suspicious endpoints immediately upon execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically information gathering and exfiltration. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors that fingerprint the host environment and send this data to attacker-controlled servers for reconnaissance or further exploitation."
