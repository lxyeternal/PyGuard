      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (a sensitive internal endpoint) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of os.system to run shell commands in install hooks, combined with hardcoded external endpoints and no user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code abuses the installation process to stealthily steal credentials and send them to an attacker-controlled server, which is a critical security risk."
