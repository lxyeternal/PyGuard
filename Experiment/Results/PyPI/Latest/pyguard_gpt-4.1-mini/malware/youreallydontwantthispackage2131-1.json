      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (a sensitive internal endpoint) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external ngrok URL (https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of os.system to run shell commands in setup hooks without user interaction, combined with hardcoded suspicious external endpoints and exfiltration of sensitive tokens, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, making it a critical risk for remote code execution and credential theft."
