      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess call to run 'curl' to send an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c) immediately upon execution of the setup script. This network activity occurs without any user interaction or consent and is embedded directly in the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, a service commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, strongly suggests data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. There is no legitimate application logic or documentation explaining this network call, and it happens as a side effect of package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malicious behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns involving unsolicited network communication during package installation."
