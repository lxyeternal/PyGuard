      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://5z5bg56mebksjokqd36na9fbq2wvkl8a.oastify.com) immediately upon package import, without any user interaction or consent. It uses the hostname hashed with SHA1 as a conditional check to selectively execute this network call, which is a form of environment fingerprinting. The request is done silently in a background thread, suppressing all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique. The domain used is non-standard and appears to be a tracking or exfiltration endpoint (oastify.com is known for out-of-band interaction testing). This pattern aligns with malicious behavior involving system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration or callback to a command-and-control server. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and it triggers automatically on import, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code exhibits clear signs of malicious intent."
