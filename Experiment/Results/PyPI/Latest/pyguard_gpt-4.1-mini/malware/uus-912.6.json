      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and a common hallmark of malicious packages. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of running arbitrary code on install is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. This can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment depending on the implementation of main(). Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with non-standard domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious endpoints is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the use of randomized query parameters further suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. Therefore, this code exhibits clear signs of malicious intent."
