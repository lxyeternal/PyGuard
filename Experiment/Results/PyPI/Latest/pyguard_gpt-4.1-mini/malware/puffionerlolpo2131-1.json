      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info) that execute a shell command during package installation or development setup. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (a sensitive internal endpoint) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c100b39f-8d06-40c4-bc5f-64e251fcc6ad). This behavior is a classic example of unauthorized data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes this network and shell activity silently during installation, without user interaction or notification, and uses a suspicious hardcoded external URL unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, as it involves automatic execution of shell commands during install, exfiltration of sensitive tokens, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
