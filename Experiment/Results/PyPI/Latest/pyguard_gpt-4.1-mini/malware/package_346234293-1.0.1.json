      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the package installation process, it executes arbitrary shell commands via subprocess.check_output without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it creates a file '/tmp/pwn' (using 'touch'), reads the system hostname ('cat /etc/hostname'), and lists directory contents ('ls -al'). Executing shell commands during package installation is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution. The code runs these commands silently as part of the install process, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying these actions. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including code execution during package installation, lack of user consent, and execution of system commands that can be used for system fingerprinting or further exploitation."
