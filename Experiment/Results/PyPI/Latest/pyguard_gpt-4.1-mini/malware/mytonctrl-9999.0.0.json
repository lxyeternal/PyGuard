      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://0no5igfzh7uwsmzmvvr9eyfy6pcg0eo3.oastify.com) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: it performs environment discovery and data exfiltration during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), uses a hardcoded suspicious URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and triggers network communication as a side effect of installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration, no error handling or logging, and no user consent. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware embedding itself in Python package installation scripts to stealthily collect and exfiltrate system information to an attacker-controlled server."
