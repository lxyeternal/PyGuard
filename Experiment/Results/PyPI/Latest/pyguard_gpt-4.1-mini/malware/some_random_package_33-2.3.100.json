      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic code execution triggered during package installation commands (install, develop, egg_info). The function 'custom_command' reconstructs strings from multiple small variables with meaningless names, then concatenates them to form strings that are passed to eval(). Specifically, it dynamically constructs and executes a call to eval() on a string that itself calls eval() on a constructed string. This double eval obfuscation is a classic technique to hide malicious payloads or commands. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hooks, which means it executes automatically during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation and use of eval in setup/install scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages rarely use such patterns. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and classified as malicious."
