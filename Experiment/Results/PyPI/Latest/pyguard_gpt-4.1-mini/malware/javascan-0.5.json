      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (an Amazon S3 bucket URL unrelated to the package's GitHub repository or typical package sources) during the setup script execution. It then directly executes the fetched content using eval('exec(code.text)') without any validation, user interaction, or consent. This pattern is a critical red flag indicating remote code execution from an untrusted source, which is a well-known hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The execution of arbitrary code fetched from the internet during package installation or setup is a high-severity threat vector that can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The silent exception handling (except Exception: pass) suppresses errors, which can hide detection and analysis. Overall, this code exhibits multiple key risk indicators of malicious intent."
