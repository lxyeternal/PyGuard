      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches for folders named 'Telegram Desktop' on drives C, D, E, F, and G, specifically looking for the presence of 'Telegram.exe' to confirm the target folder. It then copies most files from that folder (excluding certain directories and files) into a temporary directory, compresses this data into a ZIP archive, and uploads it via HTTP POST to a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple key indicators of malicious activity: it performs automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data (Telegram Desktop files), uses a hardcoded suspicious IP address for data upload, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and deletes temporary files after upload (self-cleaning). The absence of legitimate application logic, user notification, or authentication, combined with the targeting of user data directories and exfiltration to an untrusted external server, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches for 'Telegram Desktop' folders on multiple drives and copies most files (excluding certain executables and directories) into a temporary directory. It then compresses this data into a ZIP archive and uploads it via HTTP POST to a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration malware. The use of a hardcoded suspicious IP address, silent exception handling, exclusion of certain files (likely to avoid detection or corruption), and automatic scanning of multiple drives for Telegram data strongly indicate malicious intent. The code effectively steals user data from Telegram Desktop installations and sends it to a remote server, which is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware."
