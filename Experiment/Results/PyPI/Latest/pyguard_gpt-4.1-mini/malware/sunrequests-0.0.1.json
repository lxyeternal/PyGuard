      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract saved passwords from multiple popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Firefox) on a Windows system by accessing browser-specific user data directories. It uses Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to decrypt stored credentials without user consent. The extracted credentials (URLs, usernames, decrypted passwords) are saved into CSV files named with the victim's IP address and browser name, indicating targeted data collection. Immediately after extraction, these CSV files are sent to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user credentials to an attacker-controlled remote server. The code operates silently without user interaction or notification, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and deletes temporary database copies to cover tracks. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for data exfiltration, combined with credential theft from browser storage, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware that exfiltrates sensitive data to an external attacker-controlled endpoint."
