      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and appears to be generated by Pyarmor, a tool used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is a strong indicator of obfuscated and encrypted payload execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of readable logic, and the use of encrypted payloads executed at runtime, this matches the critical risk patterns of malware that use compressed or encrypted code executed dynamically to evade detection. Such behavior is typical of malicious code that hides its true intent, potentially downloading or executing further payloads, performing unauthorized actions, or exfiltrating data. Without explicit user consent or clear legitimate application logic, this obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious behavior."
