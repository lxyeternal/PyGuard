      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It contains an obfuscated payload represented as a list of integers, which is decoded by subtracting 30 from each integer and converting to characters, reconstructing a Python script. This script is then written to a temporary file '/tmp/11293.py'. Immediately after, the code constructs a shell command to execute this script using 'python3 /tmp/11293.py'. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command using os.system. This pattern—obfuscated payload decoding, writing to a temp file, and executing it during package installation—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system without their knowledge. The use of base64 encoding to hide the execution command further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
