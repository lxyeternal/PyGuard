      "malicious_behavior": "The code captures all environment variables from the host system using os.environ and immediately sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL hosted on a suspicious ngrok-free.app domain. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of potentially sensitive system and user environment data without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard, and ephemeral domain (ngrok) for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The immediate execution of this data leak upon module import further confirms the lack of transparency and user control. According to the provided knowledge points, such unsolicited environment variable collection and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware and is classified as critical risk."
