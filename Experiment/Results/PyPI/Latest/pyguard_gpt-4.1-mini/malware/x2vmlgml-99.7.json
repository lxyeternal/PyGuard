      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code uses dynamic import and execution in the install hook, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the immediate execution of code during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to run unauthorized code on the victim's system. Therefore, this code is malicious due to its execution of arbitrary code at install time without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names associated with 'oast' and 'byted-dast.com', which are commonly used in security testing or exfiltration scenarios. The code performs this data exfiltration silently, without user interaction or notification, and uses randomized query parameters to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited outbound network communication to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior, and the absence of error handling beyond logging further suggests stealth. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious due to its data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints."
