      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them as JSON data to a hardcoded Google Chat webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system and user environment information. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for transmitting environment variables is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables covert leakage of system data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Additionally, the function get_all_env attempts to run the 'printenv' shell command via subprocess.run and sends its result directly to the same webhook, further confirming the intent to gather and exfiltrate environment information. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or error handling surrounding these network transmissions, which aligns with typical malicious patterns of information stealing malware."
