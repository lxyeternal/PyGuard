      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the code snippet itself does not show obfuscation, network communication, or direct payload delivery, the execution of arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. This pattern enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Therefore, this code is considered malicious based on the presence of arbitrary code execution triggered by the package installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate services. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent handling of exceptions further indicate an attempt to stealthily fingerprint the host system. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."
