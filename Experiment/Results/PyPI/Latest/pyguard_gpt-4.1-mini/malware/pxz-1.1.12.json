      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that triggers automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects potentially sensitive system information including the public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time. This information is then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/), which is not a standard or trusted domain related to the package. This behavior constitutes unsolicited system fingerprinting and data exfiltration during installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of a hardcoded IP address for exfiltration, combined with execution triggered automatically on install, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, remote command-and-control potential, and abuse of the package installation process for stealthy information theft."
