      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large binary blob as an argument. This pattern is typical of encrypted or packed code that will be decrypted and executed at runtime. Such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with the absence of any readable or legitimate application logic. The code likely decrypts and executes hidden payloads, which is a hallmark of malware. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and the use of Pyarmor runtime with encrypted payload, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources, evasion of static analysis, and potential for further payload delivery or persistence."
