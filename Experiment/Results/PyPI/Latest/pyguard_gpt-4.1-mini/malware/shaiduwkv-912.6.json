      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This means arbitrary code in 'main.main()' will be executed automatically and without user interaction as a side effect of installing the package. This pattern of executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code does not provide any user consent, validation, or transparency about what 'main.main()' does, which raises a high risk of arbitrary code execution. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of 'main.main()', the use of dynamic import and immediate execution in the install hook is a critical risk indicator for malware. This technique can be used to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions stealthily during installation. Therefore, based on the known risk patterns and the context of this code, it is classified as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction services often used for testing or exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this data collection and transmission. The code performs automated data exfiltration of system-specific information to external servers, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform obfuscation, the unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system information to suspicious endpoints without user consent classifies this as malicious."
