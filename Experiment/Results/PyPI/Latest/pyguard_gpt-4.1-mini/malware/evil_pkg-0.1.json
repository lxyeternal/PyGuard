This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, this exfiltration occurs at the top level of the script, meaning it executes immediately upon import or execution, which is suspicious. Although the URL is localhost, the endpoint name '/steal' strongly suggests intent to steal data. The subsequent setuptools setup call appears benign but could be used to disguise the malicious data exfiltration as part of a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. The immediate environment variable harvesting and transmission without user consent or legitimate application logic is a critical risk indicator of malware."
