      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (c61vv1m2vtc00009mdj0gdy77oayyyyyb.interactsh.com). This domain is not a standard or trusted endpoint and is likely used for command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes. The network communication occurs silently during installation without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The code exhibits multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators: it executes network communication during package installation, exfiltrates sensitive system information, uses a hardcoded suspicious URL, and lacks any legitimate application logic or user notification. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as environment fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration embedded in install scripts, which are typical in malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
