      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive authentication tokens, and extracts saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding them in base64. It also attempts to read Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to obfuscate the destination. The use of hardcoded external webhook URLs for data exfiltration, combined with the harvesting of credentials and system fingerprinting, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions. The code suppresses exceptions silently in many places, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive credentials and system information to attacker-controlled endpoints, which is definitively malicious."
