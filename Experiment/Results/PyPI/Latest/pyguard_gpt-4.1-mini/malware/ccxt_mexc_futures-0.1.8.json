      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior due to the use of obfuscated dynamic code execution. Specifically, the attribute 'salt' is assigned a string constructed from hexadecimal escape sequences representing a Python expression that fetches and evaluates remote content from a hardcoded URL: 'https://v3.mexc.workers.dev/describe.json'. This string is then passed through a double eval of a compiled expression in the describe() method, effectively executing arbitrary code fetched from an external source at runtime. This pattern of fetching code from a remote URL and executing it dynamically via eval(compile(...)) is a classic and critical risk indicator of malware, as it allows attackers to inject and run arbitrary code without user consent or visibility. The obfuscation via hex escapes and double eval further confirms intent to evade static analysis. Additionally, the URL used is non-standard and suspicious, not matching official or well-known domains for the referenced package, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent. No legitimate application logic justifies this behavior, and it poses a severe security risk including remote code execution and potential payload delivery."
