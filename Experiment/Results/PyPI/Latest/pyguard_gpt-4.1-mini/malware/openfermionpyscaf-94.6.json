      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named main and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and immediate execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the victim's system as part of the package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Although the code snippet itself does not show the contents of the main module or what main() does, the presence of this install-time code execution hook is a strong red flag for malicious intent, especially given the known risks of such patterns in Python packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent according to the provided knowledge points."
