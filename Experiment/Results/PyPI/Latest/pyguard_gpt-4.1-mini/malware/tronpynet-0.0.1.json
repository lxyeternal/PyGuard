      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key value to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain (mockapi.io with a suspicious subdomain) for transmitting potentially sensitive information (private_key) aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns involving credential theft or information stealing. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another endpoint on the same suspicious domain and makes a decision based on the response, which could be part of a command-and-control or staging mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these network activities, and the function name and variable naming do not clarify any benign purpose. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server, classifying it as malicious."
