      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess call to run 'curl' to send an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c) immediately upon execution of the setup script. This network activity occurs without any user interaction or consent and is embedded directly in the setup script, which is executed during package installation. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, strongly suggests data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding this network call, no error handling, and no documentation explaining this behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unsolicited network communication during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of shell commands without validation or user notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
