      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain 'pov.sh' is not a standard or trusted source related to the package's purported purpose. The code lacks any legitimate application logic surrounding the network calls, does not validate or handle responses, and does not notify the user. Executing network requests during installation without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or command-and-control communication. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malware, specifically the combination of network communication embedded in package installation scripts targeting suspicious hardcoded URLs."

The domain 'pov.sh' on a non-standard port (45111) is not associated with any known benign service or application. This pattern aligns with typical malicious behavior involving network communication to suspicious external endpoints, which is often used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. The absence of any legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification further increases suspicion. Given the extensive knowledge points, this simple network call to a suspicious hardcoded URL without context is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
