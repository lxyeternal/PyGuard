      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom install command subclass. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain 'pov.sh' is not a standard or trusted source related to the package name or typical Python package repositories. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this network call, no error handling or user notification is present, and the request is made twice (once at import and once post-install). This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, specifically remote code execution or data exfiltration attempts triggered during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

The domain 'pov.sh' and the port 45111 are unusual and not associated with standard or trusted services. This pattern of silent network communication to a suspicious endpoint is a common indicator of malicious behavior, potentially for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. There is no surrounding legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification, which further increases suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, such hardcoded, suspicious URLs combined with unsolicited network activity and absence of benign context strongly indicate malicious intent."
