      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfsf6q8vh2wj3o8.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior occurs automatically during the installation process without user interaction or consent, constituting unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for exfiltration, combined with execution triggered during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector), strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or data collection, and the code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, a common technique for malware delivery in Python packages."
