      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time, then immediately sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) without any user interaction or consent. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install command to run the data collection and transmission. The use of a hardcoded IP address as the server endpoint, the automatic execution of network communication during installation, and the exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is embedded in package installation scripts to stealthily collect and send system data to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user notification or consent, and no error handling that would mitigate the risk. Therefore, this code is malicious."
