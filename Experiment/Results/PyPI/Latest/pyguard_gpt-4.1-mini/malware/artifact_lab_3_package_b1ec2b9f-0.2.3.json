      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the entire environment variables of the system (os.environ), encodes them in base64, and sends them via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious domain (fopdbzseohtgcssjzenyswebrkpo7g68i.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic indicator of data exfiltration and environment fingerprinting, which are common in information-stealing malware. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and the encoding of sensitive environment data before transmission strongly suggest an attempt to evade detection and exfiltrate sensitive system information. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, making this code malicious."
