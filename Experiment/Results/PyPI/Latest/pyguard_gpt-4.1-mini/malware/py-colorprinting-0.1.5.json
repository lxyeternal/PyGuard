      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the system's temporary directory, extracts its contents, and then executes an executable named 'ore-miner.exe' from the extracted folder using subprocess.Popen with flags to hide the window (creationflags combining 0x200 and 0x8). The entire operation is run in a background thread, and all exceptions are silently suppressed, which is a common evasion technique. There is no validation or integrity check on the downloaded file, no user notification, and the executable is run in a hidden manner, indicating an attempt to stealthily deploy and run potentially malicious payload. These behaviors align strongly with typical malware patterns such as remote payload retrieval, local persistence setup, and stealth execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
