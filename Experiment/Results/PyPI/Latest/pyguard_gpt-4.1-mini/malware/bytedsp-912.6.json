      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code in 'main.main()' will run automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern of executing code at install time is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of code during installation is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. This behavior can be abused to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions stealthily. Therefore, this code is considered malicious based on the known risk patterns of executing code during package installation without explicit user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names associated with 'oast' and 'byted-dast.com', which are commonly used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration contexts. The code performs this data exfiltration silently, with no user interaction or notification, and uses randomized query parameters to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited outbound network communication to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
