      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the pattern of running arbitrary code on install is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to execute payloads or further compromise the system during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names consistent with known malicious or testing domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun), which are often used for out-of-band interaction detection or exfiltration. The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, indicating potential data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding this behavior, and the use of random numbers in the URL path suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. These factors align with typical malicious patterns of environment discovery and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, making this code malicious."
