      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in the setup.py script that executes a shell command during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it collects the current username and hostname, encodes this information in base64, and then performs a DNS lookup (nslookup) to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (0.cs2elkqsmfh9um4tjq20qsxbsne6b3yi8.oast.live). This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration via DNS queries, which is a known malware technique. The execution of this network command during installation, without any legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the use of an obscure external domain strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, data encoding, exfiltration to a suspicious domain, and execution of shell commands in the install hook, all of which are hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks."
