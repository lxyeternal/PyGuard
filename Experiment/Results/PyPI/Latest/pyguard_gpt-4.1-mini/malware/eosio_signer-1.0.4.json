      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in the setup.py script that executes immediately after package installation without user consent. It collects sensitive environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), then runs shell commands to gather system information (hostname, current user, network configuration) and appends this data along with the environment variables to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Immediately after, it exfiltrates this collected data by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable harvesting, system fingerprinting, writing to a temp file, and silent data exfiltration during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The use of os.system to run shell commands and curl for data exfiltration without user interaction or notification further confirms the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes the following suspicious actions without any user interaction or consent: it runs shell commands to collect system information (hostname, current user, and network configuration) and writes the output to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Then, it performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file. This sequence is a classic example of unauthorized data exfiltration, where sensitive host environment details are gathered and sent to an attacker-controlled server. The use of hardcoded IP, absence of legitimate application logic around this network activity, no error handling, and no user notification strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, which appears benign and related to EOSIO blockchain keys, but the embedded data exfiltration in the constructor is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
