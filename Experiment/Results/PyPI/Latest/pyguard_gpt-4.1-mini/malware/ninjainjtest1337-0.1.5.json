      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function get_shell() that creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (default 10.0.0.1) on port 4242 and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh) with its stdin, stdout, and stderr redirected to the socket file descriptor. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, enabling remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the code makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain (av9f3cmae8dr818jkwjzemvek5qxen2c.oastify.com) with a timestamped URL path, which is typical for command-and-control (C2) beaconing or data exfiltration. The request_url() call is executed unconditionally at module load time, meaning the network communication happens immediately when the package is imported or installed, without user awareness. The combination of reverse shell capability, hardcoded suspicious external domain, and immediate network communication without user interaction or legitimate application logic strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no error handling, logging, or user notification, further supporting the conclusion that this code is designed for stealthy unauthorized remote access and potential data exfiltration."
