      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform a silent download and execution of an executable file named 'CBLines.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It uses PowerShell commands invoked via subprocess with shell=True to download the executable and then immediately launch it. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded file, combined with the execution of an external binary during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as executing shell commands during install, downloading and running untrusted code from a hardcoded URL, and triggering code execution as a side effect of package installation without user consent."
