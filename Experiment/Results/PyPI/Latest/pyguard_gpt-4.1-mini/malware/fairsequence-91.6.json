      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes a main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of code at install time can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the use of such an install hook to run code immediately upon installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or trusted and resemble those used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting malware behavior, where sensitive system identifiers are collected and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent."
