      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is designed to collect detailed user and system information during the package installation process without explicit user consent and send it to a hardcoded external server (IP 199.189.85.8 on port 5000). The collected data includes username, hostname, OS type and version, private IP, public IP, and approximate geolocation. This data collection and exfiltration happen automatically as a post-install hook in the setuptools installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The code uses threading to send data asynchronously but still attempts to send it during installation, which can happen without user awareness. The hardcoded external server IP and port, combined with automatic data exfiltration during install, are strong indicators of malicious intent. Although the code claims not to collect passwords and includes warnings about legal use, the behavior matches typical malicious patterns of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration embedded in package installation scripts. This is a high-risk supply chain attack pattern that can compromise user privacy and security."
