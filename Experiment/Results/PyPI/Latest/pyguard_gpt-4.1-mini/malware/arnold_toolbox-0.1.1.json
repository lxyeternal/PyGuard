      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://g5mr93si9nwr0vblbcuk1fp4cvim6du2.oastify.com) during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it triggers network communication to an untrusted domain as a side effect of installing the package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The URL appears to be a Canary token or tracking endpoint used to detect installations or executions, which is commonly used by attackers to confirm successful compromise or to exfiltrate environment information. The request is made directly in the setup script, which means it executes automatically during installation, enabling remote code execution or data exfiltration without user awareness. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this network call, and the domain is unrelated to the package's described functionality. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious activity in Python packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://g5mr93si9nwr0vblbcuk1fp4cvim6du2.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is consistent with network communication for potential data exfiltration or remote tracking. The URL domain is non-standard and appears to be a third-party service used for detecting or capturing network interactions (oastify.com), which is commonly used in security testing or malicious activity to confirm code execution or environment presence. Additionally, the commented-out code indicates intent to send system information (OS details and current working directory) to a Discord webhook, which is a known method for covertly exfiltrating sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server. The combination of these factors—unsolicited network communication to suspicious endpoints, potential exfiltration of system information, and lack of legitimate application logic or user consent—strongly indicates malicious intent. Although some parts are commented out, the active code alone already exhibits suspicious behavior typical of malware or proof-of-concept exploit code for remote code execution vulnerabilities."
