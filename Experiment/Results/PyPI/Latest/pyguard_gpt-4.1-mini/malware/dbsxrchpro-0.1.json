      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a highly obfuscated and suspicious pattern: it defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' dynamically, then decodes a large base64-encoded string that is reversed, decompresses it with zlib, and immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of reversing, base64 decoding, decompressing, and executing code is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is used to hide the true payload and evade static analysis. The payload is not visible in plain text and is executed without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior is consistent with malware that downloads or contains embedded payloads to execute arbitrary code on the host system. Given the critical risk patterns described, this code is malicious."
