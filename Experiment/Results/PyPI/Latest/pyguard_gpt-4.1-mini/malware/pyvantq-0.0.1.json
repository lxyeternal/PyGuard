It saves this executable in the current working directory and then immediately executes it silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity further supports the malicious nature. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch an executable and immediate execution is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise."

Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk behavior consistent with malware."
