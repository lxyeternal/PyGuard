      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of dynamic import and execution during install is strongly associated with malware. This is further supported by the presence of install_requires dependencies like 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious scripts for network communication and system information gathering. The lack of any user prompt, validation, or transparency about what main() does, combined with execution triggered automatically on install, fits multiple critical risk patterns for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution during package installation and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or trusted and resemble those used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system identifiers to suspicious external servers without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
