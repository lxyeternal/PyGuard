      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately after package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code does not show any legitimate application logic or user notification around this execution, making it suspicious. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing arbitrary code on install time (via setup.py install hook) is a critical risk indicator for malware, as attackers often use this to deliver payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior due to its execution of arbitrary code during installation without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent. It then sends this data as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or API. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in malicious activities. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network communication. The code silently attempts to reach these URLs and logs the response or errors without notifying the user. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data transmission to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
