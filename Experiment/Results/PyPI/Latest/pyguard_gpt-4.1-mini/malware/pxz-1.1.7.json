This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup script. The use of a hardcoded IP address as the server endpoint, combined with automatic execution on install, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user notification, and no error handling that would mitigate suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern—automatic environment fingerprinting and exfiltration during package installation to a suspicious hardcoded IP—is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware."
