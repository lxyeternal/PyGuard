      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a classic obfuscation and evasion technique to hide malicious intent. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings, and the class name is a long random string, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install process, combined with dynamic execution of decrypted code, strongly indicates malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed without user consent."
