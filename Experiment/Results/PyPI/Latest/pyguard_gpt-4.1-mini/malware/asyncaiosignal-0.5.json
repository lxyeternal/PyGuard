      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains clear malicious behavior. It implements a keylogger class (KL) that captures keystrokes silently using the 'pynput' library and periodically sends the logged keystrokes to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via HTTP POST requests to Telegram's API. This is a classic data exfiltration technique without user consent or notification. Additionally, the Compute class is designed to collect extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser data (passwords, cookies, cards, history, bookmarks, extensions, wallets), system information, running processes, screenshots, and data from various installed programs (Discord, Telegram, FileZilla, Steam, Wallets). It then packages this data into a zip archive and sends it to the same Telegram bot endpoint. The code disables SSL verification (ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context), which is often used to bypass security checks. It also includes persistence mechanisms (Autostart) and protective measures (Protectors.disable). The use of hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and chat IDs for data exfiltration, combined with the keylogging and extensive credential/data grabbing functionality, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. The code runs these operations in background threads and processes without user interaction or consent, further confirming its malicious nature."

It checks processes, MAC addresses, computer names, users, hosting status via an HTTP request, HTTP simulation, and virtual machine indicators via registry keys, video card names, and file existence. The code does not perform any network communication for exfiltration, does not execute or download code, does not write or execute files, and does not perform any suspicious or obfuscated operations. It uses standard libraries and some custom modules (asyncaiosignal) for system inspection. The purpose appears to be anti-analysis or anti-debugging protection, which is a common technique in both benign software (e.g., licensing, anti-tampering) and malware. However, no direct malicious behavior such as code injection, payload download, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation is present. The code exits the program if any check is positive, likely to prevent execution in unwanted environments. This behavior alone is not malicious but rather protective or defensive. Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided knowledge points, this code is not malicious."

Additionally, it sets the copied file's attribute to hidden, further concealing its presence. These actions—silent copying to autostart, stealthy exclusion from antivirus, and hiding the file—are classic malware persistence and evasion techniques. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures and avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the behavior is consistent with malicious intent to maintain unauthorized persistence and evade security software."

It removes any existing file at the destination path before downloading, which can be seen as self-deleting or overwriting behavior. The downloaded file is executed via subprocess.Popen with flags to create a new console and hide the window (SW_HIDE), which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. There is no validation or integrity check on the downloaded file, meaning arbitrary code from the URL can be executed on the host system. This pattern—unsupervised download and execution of remote code with hidden process execution—is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user prompts, or security checks further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."

The code references paths to user profile directories and application data folders where sensitive credentials and tokens are typically stored. The presence of SQL queries for extracting passwords, cookies, credit card data, and browsing history from Chromium-based browsers strongly indicates intent to harvest sensitive user information. Additionally, the inclusion of wallet-related folders for cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., Metamask, Phantom, Binance, Coinbase, Trust, Exodus) suggests targeting of financial assets. The SystemConfig class includes an IP information URL and a detailed system data template, implying environment reconnaissance and potential data exfiltration. The AutostartConfig points to the Windows startup folder, indicating possible persistence mechanisms. The ProtectorConfig lists known VM MAC addresses, computer names, and suspicious tasks, which are typical anti-analysis and sandbox evasion techniques used by malware. Although the code snippet does not include explicit network communication or execution logic, the overall structure, naming, and targeted data strongly align with typical malicious behavior patterns such as credential theft, system fingerprinting, persistence setup, and cryptocurrency wallet theft. These characteristics match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including targeting sensitive user directories, preparing data for exfiltration, and anti-analysis measures. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be part of a malicious information-stealing malware."

This behavior aligns with credential theft or session hijacking, as Telegram session files can be used to impersonate the user or access their account. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection, and uses obfuscated folder names (e.g., 'D877F783D5D3EF8C') which are known Telegram session folder identifiers. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the purpose is clearly to exfiltrate or stage sensitive Telegram session data. Such unauthorized collection of session files is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."

It prepares data (including a zipped archive) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the webhook. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding the network activity. The class inherits from an abstract sender, but the actual sending of potentially sensitive data to an external endpoint without validation or user consent aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns, specifically data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
