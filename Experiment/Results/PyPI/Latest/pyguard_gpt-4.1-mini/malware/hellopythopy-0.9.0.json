      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) and saves it locally as 'ins42.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.system('start '+filename) without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The use of a hardcoded URL to fetch an executable and immediate execution without verification or user notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators, including remote payload retrieval, execution during install time, lack of user consent, and execution of potentially untrusted code, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
