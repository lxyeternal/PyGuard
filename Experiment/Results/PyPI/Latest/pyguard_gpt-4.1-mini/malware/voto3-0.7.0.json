      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in the setup script that, immediately after installation, sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) with the local machine's hostname and operating system as query parameters. This behavior occurs without any user interaction or consent during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL for exfiltrating system information (hostname and OS) during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network activity, nor does it notify the user. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including execution of network communication during package installation, exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to an external endpoint, and use of a suspicious hardcoded URL. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
