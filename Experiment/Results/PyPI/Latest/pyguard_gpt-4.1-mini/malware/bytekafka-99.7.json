      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is suspicious and can be abused to run malicious payloads. This pattern matches the known malicious behavior of executing arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to legitimate or known services. The URLs appear to be related to OAST (Out-Of-Band Application Security Testing) domains, which are often used for detecting blind SSRF or exfiltration. The code generates a random number to append to the URL path, likely to evade caching or detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the data sent includes system-specific identifiers, which is a common pattern for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. These behaviors align with multiple critical and high-risk indicators of malicious activity, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system information to suspicious external endpoints without user consent or legitimate purpose."
