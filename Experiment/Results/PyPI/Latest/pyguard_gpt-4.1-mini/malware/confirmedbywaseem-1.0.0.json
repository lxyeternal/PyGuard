      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfmu6amv5mt5vvq.oast.fun). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external URL for exfiltration of system information during installation is a classic indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this network communication and does not perform any error handling or user notification. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior related to unauthorized data exfiltration triggered by package installation."
