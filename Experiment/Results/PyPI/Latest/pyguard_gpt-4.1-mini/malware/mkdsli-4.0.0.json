      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the package installation process, it collects system information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com). This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered during installation, is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code performs environment fingerprinting and exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this network communication. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
