      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It collects the local system's hostname and username, then constructs a string combining these values. This string is base64-encoded and used as part of a DNS query sent to a suspicious, non-standard domain (\"tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun\") via the nslookup command executed through os.popen. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration using DNS queries, which is a known malware technique to evade detection and exfiltrate sensitive information. The execution of shell commands during installation, the use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data, the transmission of user and host information to a suspicious external domain, and the embedding of this logic in the install hook collectively indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware."
