      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key risk indicator here is the execution of arbitrary code during installation via a dynamic import and immediate invocation, which is strongly associated with malicious behavior and supply chain attacks. There is no indication that this execution is for legitimate build or setup purposes, nor is there user notification or consent. Therefore, this pattern is a critical risk and indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating data exfiltration. The code silently suppresses exceptions during network communication, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating system fingerprinting data to suspicious external endpoints without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack."
