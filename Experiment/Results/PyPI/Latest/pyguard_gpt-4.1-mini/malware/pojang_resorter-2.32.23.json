      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, after the standard package installation, attempts to execute an executable file named 'windows.exe' located in a 'libs' subfolder within the installed library directory. This behavior triggers code execution immediately upon package installation without any user interaction or consent. Executing arbitrary binaries during installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious activity. The executable's presence is checked, but there is no validation, user notification, or logging beyond a simple print statement. The executable could perform any arbitrary action on the user's system, including malware deployment, persistence, or data exfiltration. This pattern of running an executable silently during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine as a side effect of installing the package. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules dynamically, then decodes a large base64-encoded string, reverses it, decompresses it using zlib, and executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of reversing, base64 decoding, decompressing, and then executing code is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide malicious payloads and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded and decompressed data is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to conceal and run arbitrary code without user consent or visibility. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

The decompressed data is then executed via exec(). This pattern of base64 decoding, reversing, zlib decompression, followed by immediate execution is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent. It is a known technique used to hide the true payload from static analysis and to execute arbitrary code dynamically. There is no user interaction, no legitimate application logic visible, and the entire purpose appears to be to execute hidden code. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
