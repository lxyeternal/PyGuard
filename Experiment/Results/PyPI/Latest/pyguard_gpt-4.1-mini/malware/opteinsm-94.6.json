      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code also declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their usage is not shown here. The presence of dynamic import and execution in the install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables execution of potentially harmful payloads during package installation. This pattern is well-known to be associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems. There is no indication of legitimate application logic, user prompts, or safeguards. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band (OAST) testing or command-and-control infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, specifically system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user consent."
