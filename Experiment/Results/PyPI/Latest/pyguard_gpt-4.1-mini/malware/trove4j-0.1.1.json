      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL that is base64-encoded and obfuscated to avoid easy detection. The URL decoded is 'https://6fdfcce6.0wn.sh', which is a suspicious domain not associated with any known legitimate service. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, combined with sending system-specific information (hostname) to an external, non-standard domain without user consent or interaction, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with typical malware behavior involving system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to a command-and-control server. Additionally, the code disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context), which is often used to bypass security checks and facilitate communication with potentially malicious servers. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, further supporting the conclusion that this code is malicious."
