      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, private IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication is triggered automatically during the package installation process via the setup script's entry point, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user notification or consent is requested, and the destination URL is hardcoded and not associated with any known legitimate service. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unsolicited system fingerprinting and data exfiltration triggered during package installation, which is a common malware tactic. Therefore, this code is malicious."
