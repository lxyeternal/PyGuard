      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with the exfiltration of system-specific information during install time, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including: - Execution of network communication during package installation (supply chain attack vector). - Exfiltration of sensitive environment data (hostname, cwd, username) to an external endpoint. - Use of a suspicious, hardcoded URL for data transmission. - Absence of legitimate application logic or user notification around this network activity. These factors strongly indicate that the code is designed to perform unauthorized data exfiltration as part of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
