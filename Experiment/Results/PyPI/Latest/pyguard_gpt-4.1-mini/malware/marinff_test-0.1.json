      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.247.6) on a hardcoded port (8867). This command duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history logging, and spawns a bash shell, effectively giving remote command execution control to the attacker. The payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during installation, which is a classic obfuscation and evasion technique. This behavior occurs without any user interaction or consent, embedded in the install process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded IP and port, base64 encoding, socket duplication, spawning a shell, and execution during package installation are all strong, well-known indicators of malicious intent, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. Therefore, this code is malicious."
