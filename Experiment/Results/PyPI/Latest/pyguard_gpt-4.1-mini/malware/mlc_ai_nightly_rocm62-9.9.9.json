      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallScript) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically modifies sys.path to import and execute a function main from the module pipofftheoldblock.run with a hardcoded byte string argument (b\"mar2\"). This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of dynamic import and execution in a post-install hook is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The module name 'pipofftheoldblock' and the argument 'mar2' are suspicious and not standard or documented. This pattern matches the critical risk indicator of executing arbitrary code at install time, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. There is no indication of legitimate application logic or user notification, making this behavior highly suspicious and consistent with malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and environment information without user consent, including hostname, git user email, external IP address, environment variables (excluding those starting with 'LC_'), and parent process working directories. It then encodes and compresses this data and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external IP address (http://64.23.141.119:8080/z) via an HTTP POST request. Additionally, it performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed subdomains under the suspicious domain 'ns.depcon.buzz', which is a known technique for covert data transmission or command-and-control communication. The use of subprocess to run shell commands, silent exception handling, obfuscated data encoding (base32 and base64), and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data collection, obfuscation, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints."
