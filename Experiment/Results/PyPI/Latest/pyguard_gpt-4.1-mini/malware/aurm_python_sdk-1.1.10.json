      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (PreferredSettings) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, ensuring persistence by running the downloaded script on every new shell session. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary code fetched from an external source during package installation, establishing persistence, and doing so silently with suppressed exceptions. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification about the downloaded code or its execution. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch executable code and automatic modification of user shell configuration files to run that code on shell startup are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern enables remote code execution and persistence without user consent, which is a critical security risk."
