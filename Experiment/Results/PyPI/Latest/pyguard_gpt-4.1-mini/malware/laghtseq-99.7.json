      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes a main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity directly, the pattern of executing arbitrary code on install is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to run payloads stealthily during installation. This can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that are not associated with any legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names consistent with known malicious or testing domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) often used for out-of-band interaction detection or data exfiltration. The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, and the data sent can be used for system fingerprinting or reconnaissance. This pattern of environment discovery combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior, and the use of hardcoded, non-standard URLs for data transmission further supports the classification as malicious."
