      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://canarytokens.com/terms/xosqufnrpd8jr30kqvd6g8ary/payments.js) during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. It collects and sends system-specific information such as the hostname and username to this external endpoint. This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration patterns commonly associated with malicious code, especially as it is triggered automatically during installation (a known supply chain attack vector). The URL is not a standard or trusted package source, and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicates an attempt to avoid detection. Although the package claims to be a 'harmless proof of concept,' the automatic outbound network communication with user and system identifiers to an external server during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently collects system-specific information—specifically the hostname and username—using socket.gethostname() and getpass.getuser(), then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://canarytokens.com/terms/xosqufnrpd8jr30kqvd6g8ary/payments.js). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated with malware, including environment discovery, data exfiltration, and communication with a potentially attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The request is triggered immediately upon import, with no user interaction or legitimate application logic, and exceptions are suppressed to avoid detection. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL combined with automatic data transmission of sensitive system identifiers strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for system fingerprinting or tracking purposes. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
