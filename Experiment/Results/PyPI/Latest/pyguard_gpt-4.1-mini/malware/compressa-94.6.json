      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the provided snippet itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to run unauthorized payloads or further malicious actions. Therefore, this pattern is highly suspicious and classified as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band (OAST) testing or exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior, where sensitive system identifiers are exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent. According to the provided knowledge points, this combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and transmission to suspicious hardcoded URLs is a strong indicator of malicious activity."
