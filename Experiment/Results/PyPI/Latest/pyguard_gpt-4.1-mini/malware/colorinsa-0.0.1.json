      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive credentials that can be abused for account hijacking. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64, which is a common credential theft technique. It also reads Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to any legitimate application function. The code performs these actions silently, suppressing exceptions and without any user interaction or notification. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the harvesting of tokens, passwords, and account credentials, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive user credentials and system information and send them to an attacker-controlled server."
