      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, the lack of any legitimate application logic surrounding the network call, and the execution of network communication during install time without user notification or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote data exfiltration and unauthorized code execution during package installation, making it a high-severity threat."
