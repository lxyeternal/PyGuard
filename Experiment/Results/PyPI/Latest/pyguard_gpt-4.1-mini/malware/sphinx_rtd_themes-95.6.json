      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The package name 'sphinx_rtd_themes' is a popular legitimate package name, but the version and author details are suspiciously generic and incomplete, suggesting possible typosquatting or impersonation. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware, as it enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system without explicit user consent or awareness. This pattern is a hallmark of malicious packages designed to perform unauthorized actions during installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The combination of environment fingerprinting, encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious hardcoded endpoints without user consent or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
