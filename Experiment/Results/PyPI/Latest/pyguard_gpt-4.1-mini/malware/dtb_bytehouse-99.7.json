      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user notification, or authentication further supports this conclusion. The use of randomized query parameters and multiple obscure domains suggests an attempt to evade detection and maintain persistence. Overall, this behavior aligns with known malware patterns of system reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
