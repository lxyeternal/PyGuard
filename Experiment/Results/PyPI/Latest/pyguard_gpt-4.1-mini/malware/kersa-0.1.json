      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in a Python package setup script. During installation, it executes shell commands via subprocess.run without user consent or notification. The code uses obfuscated lambdas to reconstruct strings, including a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig_setup/master/setup_moneroocean_miner.sh) which is a script hosted on GitHub. The subprocess calls attempt to run 'bash --version' and then execute a shell command that downloads and pipes the content of the remote script to bash with a specific argument (an obfuscated token). This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code is executed during package installation, fetching and running a remote script without validation or user interaction. The obfuscation, hardcoded external URL, execution of remote code during install, and suppression of exceptions all strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, and persistence. Therefore, this code is malicious."
