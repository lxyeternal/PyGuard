      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) without any user interaction or consent. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install command to run the data collection and transmission. The use of a hardcoded IP address as the server endpoint, the automatic execution of network communication during installation, and the exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where code executes during package installation to silently collect and send system fingerprinting data to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, making it a high-risk malicious pattern."
