      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, as it can be used to run payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of main() from an external module during install is suspicious and fits the pattern of malicious behavior associated with supply chain attacks. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is considered a critical risk indicator."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints often used in malicious activities. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding this network activity, and the data sent includes sensitive environment details that can be used for fingerprinting or reconnaissance. This pattern of environment discovery followed by unsolicited data transmission to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
