      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install). In the run() method, it collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this collected sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the absence of legitimate application logic or user interaction, confirms this code is designed for unauthorized data collection and transmission, which is malicious behavior."
