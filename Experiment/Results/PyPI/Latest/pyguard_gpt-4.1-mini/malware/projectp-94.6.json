      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deliver payloads, establish persistence, or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of dynamic import and execution during installation is a hallmark of malicious packages. Additionally, the package declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, further increasing suspicion. Therefore, based on the known risk patterns and the installation-time code execution, this code is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration in security testing or malicious activity. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, specifically unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
