      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them as JSON data to a hardcoded external Google Chat webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system and user environment information. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for outbound network communication to an external endpoint, combined with the immediate sending of environment variables, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the subprocess call to 'printenv' output is also sent to the same external endpoint, further confirming data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, making it consistent with typical malicious patterns of information stealing and covert data transmission."
