      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code triggers execution of potentially arbitrary code as a side effect of package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of main() from an external module during install is suspicious and fits the critical risk pattern of malicious code execution embedded in install scripts. This behavior is not typical for benign packages and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or attacker-controlled infrastructure, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration to a command-and-control server. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of environment discovery, encoding, and unsolicited network communication to suspicious endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware or staging code for further malicious activity."
