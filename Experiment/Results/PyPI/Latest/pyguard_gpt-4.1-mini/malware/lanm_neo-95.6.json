      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Although the code snippet itself does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing code during package installation is strongly associated with malicious activity, especially when the executed code is dynamically imported and run without explicit user approval. This technique is commonly used by malware to execute payloads, perform persistence, or exfiltrate data during package installation. Given the context and the known risk patterns, this code is highly suspicious and considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The combination of environment discovery, encoding, and unsolicited transmission of sensitive system information to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
