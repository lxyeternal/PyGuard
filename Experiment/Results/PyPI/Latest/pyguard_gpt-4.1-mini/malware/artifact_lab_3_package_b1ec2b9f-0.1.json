      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (csngft88cumgfr3deiig43by9rko6sn7o.oast.fun). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: environment variable access combined with data encoding and immediate exfiltration to a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domain used is not associated with any legitimate service and appears to be a temporary or malicious endpoint (oast.fun is often used for security testing or malicious callbacks). There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
