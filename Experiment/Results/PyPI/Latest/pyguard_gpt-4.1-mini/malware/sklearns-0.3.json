      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools installation script that subclasses the install command to run a post-install function 'send' immediately after installation. This function collects system information including the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'). It then constructs a URL with this data appended as a query parameter and sends a GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration triggered silently during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is a service commonly used for capturing HTTP requests for testing or malicious data collection, further indicates malicious intent. The code executes network communication during installation, exfiltrating potentially sensitive system information to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including execution of network requests during install, exfiltration of system data, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of user notification or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
