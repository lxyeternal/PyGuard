      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord authentication tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive credentials that can be abused for account hijacking. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64, indicating credential theft. It also searches for Minecraft client account credentials stored in local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to evade detection. The use of multiple webhooks for data exfiltration, combined with the absence of any legitimate user interaction or notification, strongly indicates unauthorized data theft. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding of URLs and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches classic patterns of information-stealing malware designed to harvest credentials and system information and send them to attacker-controlled endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
