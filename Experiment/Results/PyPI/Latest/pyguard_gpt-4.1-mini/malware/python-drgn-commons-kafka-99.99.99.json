      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and system data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data transmission, combined with execution triggered automatically during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including environment fingerprinting, unsolicited network communication to a hardcoded external endpoint, and execution of code during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
