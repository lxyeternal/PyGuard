      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info) that execute a shell command during package installation or development setup. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/405422660992@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com/token) without user consent or interaction, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c3913969-ff17-4757-a267-069d41c248a7). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration embedded in a package installation process, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious external webhook URL, absence of legitimate application logic, no user notification or consent, and execution of network commands during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized credential theft and exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation."
