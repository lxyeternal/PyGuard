      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://hhxy01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/PFAI.sh) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then sets executable permissions on the downloaded script and immediately executes it. This pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution sequence, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The absence of error handling, user notification, or any legitimate application logic surrounding these network and execution actions further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to fetch and run potentially untrusted and harmful code, posing a critical security risk."
