      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the immediate execution of external code during installation is a hallmark of malicious intent, as it can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise or further malicious actions."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. Then, it sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to stealthily fingerprint the host system. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting for potentially unauthorized purposes."
