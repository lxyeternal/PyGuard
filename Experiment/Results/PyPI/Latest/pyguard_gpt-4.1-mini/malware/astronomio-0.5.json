      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setuptools installation script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of base64 decoding and string encoding, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. It performs environment checks to detect debugging or analysis environments and attempts to evade execution if such conditions are met. The core payload is encrypted and compressed, then decrypted and decompressed at runtime using cryptographic primitives (AES and ChaCha20) and lzma, followed by execution via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. This dynamic execution of hidden payloads during installation is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code restricts execution to Windows platforms and forcibly exits if conditions are not met, further indicating targeted malicious intent. The use of obfuscated cryptographic keys, non-transparent data sources, and execution of decrypted code in the global namespace confirms that the code is designed to stealthily deploy and run malicious payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a high security risk."
