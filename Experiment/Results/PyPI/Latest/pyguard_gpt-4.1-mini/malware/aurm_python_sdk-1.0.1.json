      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (PreferredSettings) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, thereby establishing persistence to run this script on every new shell session. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary code fetched from an external source during package installation, without validation or user notification. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch and execute code, writing to hidden user files, and modifying shell startup scripts for persistence are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying these actions, and the pattern is consistent with known malware techniques for remote code execution and persistence via Python package installation hooks."
