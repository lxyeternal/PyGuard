      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern in the Subsys.status method. Specifically, it dynamically imports builtins and base64 modules, decodes a base64-encoded string, compiles it, and executes it via exec(). The decoded payload performs the following actions: it imports NamedTemporaryFile and executable from sys and os modules, creates a temporary file, writes to it a Python command that imports urllib.request, opens a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DATDTcxiSvq9OA6r), reads its content, and executes it. This behavior is a classic remote code execution (RCE) pattern with obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution. The hardcoded IP address is non-standard and suspicious, indicating a command-and-control or payload delivery server. The code downloads and executes arbitrary code from this external source without user consent or validation, which is a critical security risk and a hallmark of malware. The rest of the class methods appear benign and simulate subsystem management, but this embedded dynamic execution of remote code makes the entire module malicious."
