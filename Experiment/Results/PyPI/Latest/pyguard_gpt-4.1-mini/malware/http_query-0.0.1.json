      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials) without user consent and sends these sensitive credentials to an external endpoint specified by the environment variable 'WEB_HOOK'. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration. The use of an environment variable to specify the webhook URL, combined with immediate HTTP POST of sensitive secrets, is a classic pattern of data exfiltration malware. There is no user interaction or notification before this exfiltration occurs, and the code automatically triggers this behavior if the environment variable is set. This is a high-risk malicious pattern consistent with credential theft and data exfiltration malware."
