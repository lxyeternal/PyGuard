      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes an obfuscated payload embedded as a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(). This payload imports modules such as os, shutil, requests, zipfile, and uuid, and performs suspicious file system operations. It defines hardcoded constants for TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID and TELEGRAM_TOKEN, and constructs a temporary directory path under /tmp/Telegram Desktop/Telegram.exe, which is unusual and suspicious. The code enumerates files in this directory, filters them by suspicious registry keys and user registry keys, and attempts to copy and zip these files. It then sends these zipped files via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint, effectively exfiltrating data without user consent. The code also uses threading to perform these operations asynchronously and suppresses exceptions silently. The presence of dynamic code execution from obfuscated data, file system enumeration, data compression, and exfiltration to a hardcoded external Telegram bot endpoint is a classic hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code attempts to inject into urllib3 for SSL fallback and suppresses dependency warnings, which may be an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is a supply chain attack vector or backdoor that collects and exfiltrates data covertly, making it malicious."
