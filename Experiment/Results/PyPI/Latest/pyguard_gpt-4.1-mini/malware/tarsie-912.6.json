      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code does not provide any indication that the executed main() function is benign or related to legitimate setup tasks. The dynamic import and execution of main() during install is suspicious and can be abused to run arbitrary malicious payloads. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing code on install time without user consent is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim system as part of the package installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to external endpoints is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. The absence of legitimate application logic, user notification, or consent, and the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs for data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent."
