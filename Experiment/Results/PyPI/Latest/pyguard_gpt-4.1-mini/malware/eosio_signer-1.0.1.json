      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes the following suspicious actions without any user interaction or consent: it runs shell commands to collect system information (hostname, current user, and network configuration) and writes the output to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Then, it performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file. This sequence is a classic example of unauthorized data exfiltration, where sensitive host environment details are gathered and sent to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of hardcoded IP, absence of legitimate application logic around this network activity, and lack of user notification or consent strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling and signing functionality typical for EOSIO keys, but the embedded data exfiltration behavior in the constructor is a critical risk indicator of malware."
