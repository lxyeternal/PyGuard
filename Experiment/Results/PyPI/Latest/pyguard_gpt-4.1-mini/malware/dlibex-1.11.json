      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN and writes it to a hidden directory within the user's AppData Local folder with a randomized filename. It then sets the file attribute to hidden and immediately executes the downloaded script in a subprocess with suppressed stdout and stderr, running detached from the parent process. This pattern—unsolicited download and execution of remote code without user interaction or validation, use of hidden directories and randomized filenames, and execution of potentially untrusted code—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code effectively implements a remote payload retrieval and execution mechanism, which is a common malware technique for persistence, evasion, and further compromise."
