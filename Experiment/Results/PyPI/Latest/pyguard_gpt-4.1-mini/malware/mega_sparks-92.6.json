      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. The use of dynamic import and immediate execution in the install hook is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information without user consent, use of hardcoded suspicious external endpoints, base64 encoding of data to evade detection, and absence of legitimate application logic or user interaction. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble those used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration. The code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors collectively indicate that the code is performing unauthorized system fingerprinting and data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
