      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information such as username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive authentication tokens. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64, which is a common credential theft technique. It also reads Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URL, which decodes to a Discord webhook endpoint (discordapp.com domain). The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration is a classic malware pattern. The code performs these actions silently, with exception suppression, and no user interaction or notification, indicating covert data theft. The combination of environment discovery, credential harvesting, and immediate exfiltration to an external endpoint without any legitimate application logic or user consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
