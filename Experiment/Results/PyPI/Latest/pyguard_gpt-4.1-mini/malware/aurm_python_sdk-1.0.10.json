      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network activity during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to modify user shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) to add a command that executes this downloaded script automatically in future shell sessions. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism and remote code execution vector embedded in the install hook of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack pattern. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection, and does not validate or notify the user about the downloaded content. The combination of downloading and executing remote code during installation, writing to hidden user files, and modifying shell startup scripts without user consent is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
