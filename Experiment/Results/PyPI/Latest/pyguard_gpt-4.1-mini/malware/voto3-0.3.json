      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system-specific information (hostname and OS type) combined with the public IP address to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior occurs without any user interaction or consent, during the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL for exfiltration of environment and network data is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. The code leverages the setuptools install hook to execute network communication automatically, which is a typical malicious pattern for remote data collection or fingerprinting. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call, no error handling, and no user notification, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
