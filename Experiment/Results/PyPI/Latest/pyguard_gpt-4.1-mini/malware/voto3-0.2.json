      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in a Python package setup script that, immediately after installation, sends system-specific information (hostname and OS type) combined with the public IP address to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This occurs without any user interaction or consent, during the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external URL for exfiltration of environment data, triggered automatically on install, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network activity, nor does it notify the user. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unsolicited environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation."
