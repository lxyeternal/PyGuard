      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. The use of a custom install command subclass to run code on install is a critical risk indicator for malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band (OAST) testing or command-and-control communication. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting behavior used by malware to profile infected hosts and exfiltrate sensitive system identifiers to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
