      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code in 'main.main()' will run automatically upon package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code at install time via setup.py install hooks is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the provided snippet itself does not show the contents of 'main.main()', the pattern of triggering code execution during installation is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it can be used to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform other unauthorized actions stealthily. Additionally, the package declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, further increasing suspicion. Without explicit user interaction or transparency, this install-time code execution is a hallmark of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent."
