      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including IP address, hostname, fully qualified domain name, OS details, Python version, installed path, current working directory, and a timestamp without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/245615f1-8656-4569-a66d-8869e17559fb), which is a generic external service often used for capturing HTTP requests and can be abused for data exfiltration. The behavior matches a classic pattern of environment fingerprinting and unsolicited data exfiltration to an external endpoint, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or consent surrounding this network activity, and the webhook URL is not associated with any known legitimate service. The code also suppresses all exceptions silently, which can be used to avoid detection. Based on the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware performing information stealing and remote data exfiltration."
