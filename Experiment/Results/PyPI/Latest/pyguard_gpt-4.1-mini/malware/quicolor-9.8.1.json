      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently collects the Telegram Desktop user data folder ('tdata') from the current user's AppData Roaming directory, compresses it into a ZIP file named after the username, and uploads this ZIP file to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data without any user interaction, consent, or notification. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot API key and chat ID for uploading the data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and deletes the ZIP file after upload, which is typical anti-forensics behavior. The operation targets sensitive user directories and performs network communication to an external endpoint controlled by the attacker. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious and is designed to steal user data covertly."
