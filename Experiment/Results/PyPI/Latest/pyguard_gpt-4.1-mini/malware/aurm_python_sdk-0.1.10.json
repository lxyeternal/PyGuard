      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in setup.py that, during package installation, silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, ensuring persistence by running the downloaded script on every new shell session. This behavior occurs without any user interaction, consent, or validation of the downloaded content. The downloaded script is executed indirectly via shell command on shell startup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch and persistently execute code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly indicative of malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
