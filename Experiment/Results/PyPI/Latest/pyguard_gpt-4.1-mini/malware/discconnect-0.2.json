      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, upon package installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using the Windows API call WinExec without any user interaction, consent, validation, or integrity checks. This pattern—downloading and executing an external binary during package installation without user awareness—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The use of a non-standard URL hosting service, absence of error handling or logging, and execution of an arbitrary executable file during install time are critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
