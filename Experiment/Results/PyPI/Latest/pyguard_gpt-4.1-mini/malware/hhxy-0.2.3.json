      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://hhxy01.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/PFAI.sh) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then sets executable permissions on the downloaded script and immediately executes it. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. The absence of error handling, logging, or user notification further increases suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, automated download and execution of code from hardcoded external URLs without validation or user consent is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware or supply chain attack vectors."
